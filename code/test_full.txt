Title: Novobiocin biosynthesis: inactivation of the putative regulatory gene novE and heterologous expression of genes involved in aminocoumarin ring formation Abstract: The left ends of the biosynthetic gene clusters of novobiocin ( nov), clorobiocin ( clo) and coumermycin A(1) ( cou) from Streptomyces spheroides (syn. S. caeruleus) NCIMB 11891, S. roseochromogenes var. oscitans DS 12.976 and S. rishiriensis DSM 40489 were cloned and sequenced. Sequence comparison suggested that novE, cloE and couE, respectively, represent the borders of these three clusters. Inactivation of novE proved that novE does not have an essential catalytic role in novobiocin biosynthesis, but is likely to have a regulatory function. The gene products of novF and cloF show sequence similarity to prephenate dehydrogenase and may produce 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate (4HPP) as a precursor of the substituted benzoate moiety of novobiocin and clorobiocin. Coumermycin A(1) does not contain this benzoate moiety, and correspondingly the coumermycin cluster was found not to contain a functional novF homologue. The coumermycin biosynthetic gene cluster apparently evolved from an ancestral cluster similar to those of novobiocin and clorobiocin, and parts of the ancestral novF homologue have been deleted in this process. No homologue to novC was identified in the gene clusters of clorobiocin and coumermycin, questioning the postulated involvement of novC in aminocoumarin biosynthesis. Heterologous expression of novDEFGHIJK in Streptomyces lividans resulted in the formation of 2,4-dihydroxy-alpha-oxy-phenylacetic acid, suggesting that at least one of the proteins encoded by these genes may participate in a hydroxylation reaction.	1
Title: Plasmid deoxyribonucleic acid in Rhizobium trifolii Abstract: In deoxyribonucleic acid of Rhizobium trifolii centrifuged in cesium chloride-ethidium bromide equilibrium was found a sattelite peak containing covalently closed circular deoxyribonucleic acid. The plasmid had a molecular weight of about 64 x 10(6) shown by sedimentation in sucrose gradients and electron microscopy.	0
Title: Biotransformation of 2-benzoxazolinone and 2-hydroxy-1,4-benzoxazin-3-one by endophytic fungi isolated from Aphelandra tetragona Abstract: The biotransformation of the phytoanticipins 2-benzoxazolinone (BOA) and 2-hydroxy-1,4-benzoxazin-3-one (HBOA) by four endophytic fungi isolated from Aphelandra tetragona was studied. Using high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, several new products of acylation, oxidation, reduction, hydrolysis, and nitration were identified. Fusarium sambucinum detoxified BOA and HBOA to N-(2-hydroxyphenyl)malonamic acid. Plectosporium tabacinum, Gliocladium cibotii, and Chaetosphaeria sp. transformed HBOA to 2-hydroxy-N-(2-hydroxyphenyl)acetamide, N-(2-hydroxyphenyl)acetamide, N-(2-hydroxy-5-nitrophenyl)acetamide, N-(2-hydroxy-3-nitrophenyl)acetamide, 2-amino-3H-phenoxazin-3-one, 2-acetylamino-3H-phenoxazin-3-one, and 2-(N-hydroxy)acetylamino-3H-phenoxazin-3-one. BOA was not degraded by these three fungal isolates. Using 2-hydroxy-N-(2-hydroxyphenyl)[(13)C(2)]acetamide, it was shown that the metabolic pathway for HBOA and BOA degradation leads to o-aminophenol as a key intermediate.	0
Title: Automated structure prediction of trans-acyltransferase polyketide synthase products Abstract: Bacterial trans-acyltransferase polyketide synthases (trans-AT PKSs) are among the most complex known enzymes from secondary metabolism and are responsible for the biosynthesis of highly diverse bioactive polyketides. However, most of these metabolites remain uncharacterized, since trans-AT PKSs frequently occur in poorly studied microbes and feature a remarkable array of non-canonical biosynthetic components with poorly understood functions. As a consequence, genome-guided natural product identification has been challenging. To enable de novo structural predictions for trans-AT PKS-derived polyketides, we developed the trans-AT PKS polyketide predictor (TransATor). TransATor is a versatile bio- and chemoinformatics web application that suggests informative chemical structures for even highly aberrant trans-AT PKS biosynthetic gene clusters, thus permitting hypothesis-based, targeted biotechnological discovery and biosynthetic studies. We demonstrate the applicative scope in several examples, including the characterization of new variants of bioactive natural products as well as structurally new polyketides from unusual bacterial sources.	1
Title: Insights on Escherichia coli biofilm formation and inhibition from whole-transcriptome profiling Abstract: Biofilms transform independent cells into specialized cell communities. Here are presented some insights into biofilm formation ascertained with the best-characterized strain, Escherichia coli. Investigations of biofilm formation and inhibition with this strain using whole-transcriptome profiling coupled to phenotypic assays, in vivo DNA binding studies and isogenic mutants have led to discoveries related to the role of stress, to the role of intra- and interspecies cell signalling, to the impact of the environment on cell signalling, to biofilm inhibition by manipulating cell signalling, to the role of toxin/antitoxin genes in biofilm formation, and to the role of small RNAs on biofilm formation and dispersal. Hence, E. coli is an excellent resource for determining paradigms in biofilm formation and biofilm inhibition.	0
Title: Initiation of the flexirubin biosynthesis in Chitinophaga pinensis Abstract: Bacteria from the Bacteroidetes phylum are known producers of the chemotaxonomic relevant flexirubins. These orange pigments comprise a non-isoprenoid aryl-polyene carboxylic acid esterified with a dialkylresorcinol. Herein, we report a gene cluster from Chitinophaga pinensis encoding the biosynthesis of the polyene moiety and the biochemical characterization of a tyrosine ammonia-lyase and a 4-coumarate-CoA ligase responsible for the initiation of the polyene biosynthesis. Additionally, the flexirubin of C. pinensis was characterized by a combination of feeding experiments, high-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry.	1
Title: A transglutaminase homologue as a condensation catalyst in antibiotic assembly lines Abstract: The unrelenting emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacterial pathogens demands the investigation of antibiotics with new modes of action. The pseudopeptide antibiotic andrimid is a nanomolar inhibitor of the bacterial acetyl-CoA carboxylase that catalyses the first committed step in prokaryotic fatty acid biosynthesis. Recently, the andrimid (adm) biosynthetic gene cluster was isolated and heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli. This establishes a heterologous biological host in which to rapidly probe features of andrimid formation and to use biosynthetic engineering to make unnatural variants of this important and promising new class of antibiotics. Bioinformatic analysis of the adm cluster revealed a dissociated biosynthetic assembly system lacking canonical amide synthases between the first three carrier protein domains. Here we report that AdmF, a transglutaminase (TGase) homologue, catalyses the formation of the first amide bond, an N-acyl-beta-peptide link, in andrimid biosynthesis. Hence, AdmF is a newly discovered biosynthetic enzyme that acts as a stand-alone amide synthase between protein-bound, thiotemplated substrates in an antibiotic enzymatic assembly line. TGases (enzyme class (EC) 2.3.2.13) normally catalyse the cross-linking of (poly)peptides by creating isopeptidic bonds between the gamma-carboxamide group of a glutamine side chain of one protein and various amine donors, including lysine side chains. To the best of our knowledge, the present study constitutes the first report of a TGase-like enzyme recruited for the assembly of an antibiotic. Moreover, genome mining using the AdmF sequence yielded additional TGases in unassigned natural product biosynthetic pathways. With many more microbial genomes being sequenced, such a strategy could potentially unearth biosynthetic pathways producing new classes of antibiotics.	1
Title: Hybrid Transcription Factor Engineering Activates the Silent Secondary Metabolite Gene Cluster for (+)-Asperlin in Aspergillus nidulans Abstract: Fungi are a major source of valuable bioactive secondary metabolites (SMs). These compounds are synthesized by enzymes encoded by genes that are clustered in the genome. The vast majority of SM biosynthetic gene clusters are not expressed under normal growth conditions, and their products are unknown. Developing methods for activation of these silent gene clusters offers the potential for discovering many valuable new fungal SMs. While a number of useful approaches have been developed, they each have limitations, and additional tools are needed. One approach, upregulation of SM gene cluster-specific transcription factors that are associated with many SM gene clusters, has worked extremely well in some cases, but it has failed more often than it has succeeded. Taking advantage of transcription factor domain modularity, we developed a new approach. We fused the DNA-binding domain of a transcription factor associated with a silent SM gene cluster with the activation domain of a robust SM transcription factor, AfoA. Expression of this hybrid transcription factor activated transcription of the genes in the target cluster and production of the antibiotic (+)-asperlin. Deletion of cluster genes confirmed that the cluster is responsible for (+)-asperlin production, and we designate it the aln cluster. Separately, coinduction of expression of two aln cluster genes revealed the pathway intermediate (2 Z,4 Z,6 E)-octa-2,4,6-trienoic acid, a compound with photoprotectant properties. Our findings demonstrate the potential of our novel synthetic hybrid transcription factor strategy to discover the products of other silent fungal SM gene clusters.	1
Title: Elucidation of the biosynthetic gene cluster and the post-PKS modification mechanism for fostriecin in Streptomyces pulveraceus Abstract: Fostriecin is a unique phosphate monoester antibiotic that was isolated from Streptomyces pulveraceus as a protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) and PP4A selective inhibitor. However, its biosynthetic mechanism remains to be elucidated. In this study, a 73 kb gene cluster encoding a six modular Type I polyketide synthases (PKS) and seven tailoring enzymes was identified by cosmid sequencing from the producer. The functions of two tailoring enzymes were characterized by gene disruption and an in vitro enzyme activity assay. Remarkably, the isolation of three malonylated fostriecin analogs from post-PKS gene knockout mutants indicated malonylated-polyketide formation could be a normal biosynthetic process in the formation of the unsaturated six-membered lactone in fostriecin. Based on this study, a comprehensive post-PKS modification mechanism for fostriecin biosynthesis was proposed.	1
Title: Discovery and characterization of a cytochalasan biosynthetic cluster from the marine-derived fungus Aspergillus flavipes CNL-338 Abstract: Cytochalasans are a large family of well-studied cytotoxic molecules isolated from fungi. Investigation into the organic extract of the marine-derived fungal strain Aspergillus flavipes CNL-338 led to the isolation of seven leucine-containing cytochalasans. Genome mining allowed for the identification of the ffs biosynthetic gene cluster, and genetic inactivation studies verified its involvement in cytochalasan biosynthesis. In addition, comparative analysis of key residues in the binding pocket of core cytochalasan biosynthetic enzymes revealed significant similarities among fungal adenylation domains despite differences in substrate preference. We report the identification of leucine-containing cytochalasans from the marine-derived A. flavipes CNL-338 and the characterization of the ffs biosynthetic cluster as verified by genetic inactivation studies.	1
Title: The Generation and Exploitation of Protein Mutability Landscapes for Enzyme Engineering Abstract: The increasing number of enzyme applications in chemical synthesis calls for new engineering methods to develop the biocatalysts of the future. An interesting concept in enzyme engineering is the generation of large-scale mutational data in order to chart protein mutability landscapes. These landscapes allow the important discrimination between beneficial mutations and those that are neutral or detrimental, thus providing detailed insight into sequence-function relationships. As such, mutability landscapes are a powerful tool with which to identify functional hotspots at any place in the amino acid sequence of an enzyme. These hotspots can be used as targets for combinatorial mutagenesis to yield superior enzymes with improved catalytic properties, stability, or even new enzymatic activities. The generation of mutability landscapes for multiple properties of one enzyme provides the exciting opportunity to select mutations that are beneficial either for one or for several of these properties. This review presents an overview of the recent advances in the construction of mutability landscapes and discusses their importance for enzyme engineering.	0
Title: Insights into the biosynthesis of 12-membered resorcylic acid lactones from heterologous production in Saccharomyces cerevisiae Abstract: The phytotoxic fungal polyketides lasiodiplodin and resorcylide inhibit human blood coagulation factor XIIIa, mineralocorticoid receptors, and prostaglandin biosynthesis. These secondary metabolites belong to the 12-membered resorcylic acid lactone (RAL12) subclass of the benzenediol lactone (BDL) family. Identification of genomic loci for the biosynthesis of lasiodiplodin from Lasiodiplodia theobromae and resorcylide from Acremonium zeae revealed collaborating iterative polyketide synthase (iPKS) pairs whose efficient heterologous expression in Saccharomyces cerevisiae provided a convenient access to the RAL12 scaffolds desmethyl-lasiodiplodin and trans-resorcylide, respectively. Lasiodiplodin production was reconstituted in the heterologous host by co-expressing an O-methyltransferase also encoded in the lasiodiplodin cluster, while a glutathione-S-transferase was found not to be necessary for heterologous production. Clarification of the biogenesis of known resorcylide congeners in the heterologous host helped to disentangle the roles that biosynthetic irregularities and chemical interconversions play in generating chemical diversity. Observation of 14-membered RAL homologues during in vivo heterologous biosynthesis of RAL12 metabolites revealed "stuttering" by fungal iPKSs. The close global and domain-level sequence similarities of the orthologous BDL synthases across different structural subclasses implicate repeated horizontal gene transfers and/or cluster losses in different fungal lineages. The absence of straightforward correlations between enzyme sequences and product structural features (the size of the macrocycle, the conformation of the exocyclic methyl group, or the extent of reduction by the hrPKS) suggest that BDL structural variety is the result of a select few mutations in key active site cavity positions.	1
Title: Non-Deprotonative Primary and Secondary Amination of (Hetero)Arylmetals Abstract: Herein we disclose a novel method for the facile transfer of primary (-NH2) and secondary amino groups (-NHR) to heteroaryl- as well as arylcuprates at low temperature without the need for precious metal catalysts, ligands, excess reagents, protecting and/or directing groups. This one-pot transformation allows unprecedented functional group tolerance and it is well-suited for the amination of electron-rich, electron-deficient as well as structurally complex (hetero)arylmetals. In some of the cases, only catalytic amounts of a copper(I) salt is required.	0
Title: Visible and infrared three-wavelength modulated multi-directional actuators Abstract: In recent years, light-guided robotic soft actuators have attracted intense scientific attention and rapidly developed, although it still remains challenging to precisely and reversibly modulate the moving directions and shape morphing modes of soft actuators with ease of stimulating operation. Here we report a strategy of building a multi-stimuli-responsive liquid crystal elastomer soft actuator system capable of performing not only multi-directional movement, but also different shape morphing modes. This strategy is based on the selective stimulation of specific domains of the hierarchical structured actuator through the modulation of three wavelength bands (520, 808, 980 nm) of light stimulus, which release the actuation system from light scanning position/direction restriction. Three near-infrared dual-wavelength modulated actuators and one visible/infrared tri-wavelength modulated multi-directional walker robot are demonstrated in this work. These devices have broad application prospects in robotic and biomimetic technology.	0
Title: A cold oceanographic regime with high exploitation rates in the Northeast Pacific forecasts a collapse of the sardine stock Abstract: The oceanographic conditions in the north Pacific have shifted to a colder period, Pacific sardine (Sardinops sagax) biomass has declined precipitously in the California Current, the international sardine fishery is collapsing, and mackerel (Trachurus symmetricus and Scomber japonicus) are thriving. This situation occurred in the mid-1900s, but indices of current oceanographic conditions and the results of our acoustic-trawl surveys indicate it likely is recurring now, perhaps with similar socioeconomic and ecological consequences. Also alarming is the repetition of the fishery's response to a declining sardine stock-progressively higher exploitation rates targeting the oldest, largest, and most fecund fish. Furthermore, our data indicate the recent reproductive condition of sardine is poor, and their productivity is below modeled estimates used to derive the current fishery-exploitation rates. Consequently, the sardine population has been reduced to two cohorts that are unlikely to produce an appreciable new cohort. Thus, a near-term recovery of this important stock is unlikely, depending on the return of warmer oceanographic conditions, reduced pressure from mackerel species, and perhaps the adoption of a more precautionary strategy for managing the residual sardine population.	0
Title: Immunological relationships among some species of extremely halophilic bacteria Abstract: Rabbits were immunized with four strains of halobacteria, Halobacterium halobium NRL, H. halobium R-1, H. salinarium NRL-9, and H. cutirubrum NRL-10, that had been fixed with formaldehyde. The antisera obtained detected the presence of an antigen common to the Halobacterium genus and, after absorption, detected three distinct antigenic groups within the Halobacterium genus. A fourth group was agglutinated only by unabsorbed sera.	0
Title: The spa-box for transcriptional activation of subtilin biosynthesis and immunity in Bacillus subtilis Abstract: The subtilin gene cluster (spa) of Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6633 is organized in transcriptional units spaBTC, spaS, spaIFEG and spaRK. Specific binding of the response regulator protein SpaR to spaB, spaS and spaI DNA promoter fragments was shown by means of electromobility shift assays. A repeated pentanucleotide sequence spaced by six nucleotides was identified as SpaR binding motif (spa-box). Saturating mutational analysis of the spa-box by single- and multiple-base-pair substitutions revealed the consensus motif (A/T)TGAT for optimal SpaR binding with the second, third and fifth position being absolutely conservative. Variations in the spacer size between the two pentanucleotide repeats revealed a strong conservation of their relative location. Only DNA with a proximal arrangement of two pentanucleotide repeats showed affinity to SpaR. A 2:1 stoichiometry between SpaR and DNA was obtained by optical biosensor analyses, which corresponds to the binding of two SpaR proteins per spa-box.	1
Title: Lincosamide synthetase--a unique condensation system combining elements of nonribosomal peptide synthetase and mycothiol metabolism Abstract: In the biosynthesis of lincosamide antibiotics lincomycin and celesticetin, the amino acid and amino sugar units are linked by an amide bond. The respective condensing enzyme lincosamide synthetase (LS) is expected to be an unusual system combining nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) components with so far unknown amino sugar related activities. The biosynthetic gene cluster of celesticetin was sequenced and compared to the lincomycin one revealing putative LS coding ORFs shared in both clusters. Based on a bioassay and production profiles of S. lincolnensis strains with individually deleted putative LS coding genes, the proteins LmbC, D, E, F and V were assigned to LS function. Moreover, the newly recognized N-terminal domain of LmbN (LmbN-CP) was also assigned to LS as a NRPS carrier protein (CP). Surprisingly, the homologous CP coding sequence in celesticetin cluster is part of ccbZ gene adjacent to ccbN, the counterpart of lmbN, suggesting the gene rearrangement, evident also from still active internal translation start in lmbN, and indicating the direction of lincosamide biosynthesis evolution. The in vitro test with LmbN-CP, LmbC and the newly identified S. lincolnensis phosphopantetheinyl transferase Slp, confirmed the cooperation of the previously characterized NRPS A-domain LmbC with a holo-LmbN-CP in activation of a 4-propyl-L-proline precursor of lincomycin. This result completed the functional characterization of LS subunits resembling NRPS initiation module. Two of the four remaining putative LS subunits, LmbE/CcbE and LmbV/CcbV, exhibit low but significant homology to enzymes from the metabolism of mycothiol, the NRPS-independent system processing the amino sugar and amino acid units. The functions of particular LS subunits as well as cooperation of both NRPS-based and NRPS-independent LS blocks are discussed. The described condensing enzyme represents a unique hybrid system with overall composition quite dissimilar to any other known enzyme system.	1
Title: Identification and Biological Activity of NFAT-133 Congeners from Streptomyces pactum Abstract: The soil bacterium Streptomyces pactum ATCC 27456 produces a number of polyketide natural products. Among them is NFAT-133, an inhibitor of the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) that suppresses interleukin-2 (IL-2) expression and T cell proliferation. Biosynthetic gene inactivation in the ATCC 27456 strain revealed the ability of this strain to produce other polyketide compounds including analogues of NFAT-133. Consequently, seven new derivatives of NFAT-133, TM-129-TM-135, together with a known compound, panowamycin A, were isolated from the culture broth of S. pactum ATCC 27456 ΔptmTDQ. Their chemical structures were elucidated on the basis of their HRESIMS, 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopy, and ECD calculation and spectral data. NFAT-133, TM-132, TM-135, and panowamycin A showed no antibacterial activity or cytotoxicity, but weakly reduced the production of LPS-induced nitric oxide in RAW264.7 cells in a dose-dependent manner. A revised chemical structure of panowamycin A and proposed modes of formation of the new NFAT-133 analogues are also presented.	0

Title: Genome sequence of Moraxella catarrhalis RH4, an isolate of seroresistant lineage Abstract: Here we report the annotated genome sequence of Moraxella catarrhalis strain RH4, a seroresistant-lineage strain isolated from the blood of an infected patient. This genome sequence will allow us to gain further insight into the genetic diversity of clinical M. catarrhalis isolates and will facilitate study of M. catarrhalis pathogenesis.	0
Title: Development of antibiotic activity profile screening for the classification and discovery of natural product antibiotics Abstract: Despite recognition of the looming antibiotic crisis by healthcare professionals, the number of new antibiotics reaching the clinic continues to decline sharply. This study aimed to establish an antibiotic profiling strategy using a panel of clinically relevant bacterial strains to create unique biological fingerprints for all major classes of antibiotics. Antibiotic mode of action profile (BioMAP) screening has been shown to effectively cluster antibiotics by structural class based on these fingerprints. Using this approach, we have accurately predicted the presence of known antibiotics in natural product extracts and have discovered a naphthoquinone-based antibiotic from our marine natural product library that possesses a unique carbon skeleton. We have demonstrated that bioactivity fingerprinting is a successful strategy for profiling antibiotic lead compounds and that BioMAP can be applied to the discovery of new natural product antibiotics leads.	0
Title: Structures of the genes for the beta and epsilon subunits of spinach chloroplast ATPase indicate a dicistronic mRNA and an overlapping translation stop/start signal Abstract: A 2,4-kilobase-pair region of spinach chloroplast DNA adjacent to the gene for the large subunit of ribulosebisphosphate carboxylase has been analyzed by RNA hybridization, in vitro transcription/translation, and DNA sequence determination. The analysis indicates that this region carries the genes for the beta and epsilon subunits of chloroplast ATPase and that the two genes are cotranscribed into a dicistronic mRNA with 4-base-pair overlap between the stop codon of the beta-subunit gene and the start codon of the epsilon-subunit gene. The ATPase and carboxylase genes are transcribed divergently with respect to each other. The deduced amino acid sequences of the beta and epsilon subunits from spinach show 67% and 26% homology, respectively, with the published sequences of the beta and epsilon subunits of Escherichia coli ATPase.	0
Title: Nature's Combinatorial Biosynthesis Produces Vatiamides A-F Abstract: Hybrid type I PKS/NRPS biosynthetic pathways typically proceed in a collinear manner wherein one molecular building block is enzymatically incorporated in a sequence that corresponds to gene arrangement. In this work, genome mining combined with the use of a fluorogenic azide-based click probe led to the discovery and characterization of vatiamides A-F, three structurally diverse alkynylated lipopeptides, and their brominated analogues, from the cyanobacterium Moorea producens ASI16Jul14-2. These derive from a unique combinatorial non-collinear PKS/NRPS system encoded by a 90 kb gene cluster in which an upstream PKS cassette interacts with three separate cognate NRPS partners. This is facilitated by a series of promiscuous intermodule PKS-NRPS docking motifs possessing identical amino acid sequences. This interaction confers a new type of combinatorial capacity for creating molecular diversity in microbial systems.	1
Title: Total counts of marine bacteria include a large fraction of non-nucleoid-containing bacteria (ghosts) Abstract: Counts of heterotrophic bacteria in marine waters are usually in the order of 5 x 10(sup5) to 3 x 10(sup6) bacteria ml(sup-1). These numbers are derived from unspecific fluorescent staining techniques (J. E. Hobbie, R. J. Daley, and S. Jasper, Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 33:1225-1228, 1977; K. G. Porter and Y. S. Feig, Limnol. Oceanogr. 25:943-948, 1980) and are subsequently defined as total counts of bacteria. In samples from the Baltic Sea, the North Sea (Skagerrak), and the northeastern Mediterranean Sea, we found that only a minor fraction (2 to 32%) of total counts can be scored as bacteria with nucleoids. Lack of DNA no doubt means inactive cells; therefore, a much lower number of bacteria that grow at rates higher than those previously estimated must be responsible for the measured bacterial production in these seas. The remaining bacterium-sized and/or -shaped particles included in total counts may be cell residues of virus-lysed bacteria (ghosts) or remains of protozoan grazing.	0
Title: Role of the LolP cytochrome P450 monooxygenase in loline alkaloid biosynthesis Abstract: The insecticidal loline alkaloids, produced by Neotyphodium uncinatum and related endophytes, are exo-1-aminopyrrolizidines with an ether bridge between C-2 and C-7. Loline alkaloids vary in methyl, acetyl, and formyl substituents on the 1-amine, which affect their biological activity. Enzymes for key loline biosynthesis steps are probably encoded by genes in the LOL cluster, which is duplicated in N. uncinatum, except for a large deletion in lolP2. The role of lolP1 was investigated by its replacement with a hygromycin B phosphotransferase gene. Compared to wild type N. uncinatum and an ectopic transformant, DeltalolP1 cultures had greatly elevated levels of N-methylloline (NML) and lacked N-formylloline (NFL). Complementation of DeltalolP1 with lolP1 under control of the Emericella nidulans trpC promoter restored NFL production. These results and the inferred sequence of LolP1 indicate that it is a cytochrome P450, catalyzing oxygenation of an N-methyl group in NML to the N-formyl group in NFL.	1
Title: Molecular characterization of two genes from Streptomyces tendae Tü901 required for the formation of the 4-formyl-4-imidazolin-2-one-containing nucleoside moiety of the peptidyl nucleoside antibiotic nikkomycin Abstract: The genes nikQ and nikR were identified by sequencing DNA of the nikkomycin biosynthetic gene cluster from Streptomyces tendae Tü901/8c. The nikQ gene encodes a P450 cytochrome, and the predicted NikR gene product shows 48-56% sequence identity with uracil phosphoribosyltransferases from eukaryotic organisms. The nikQ and nikR genes were inactivated separately by insertion of a kanamycin-resistance cassette. Inactivation of the nikQ gene abolished synthesis of nikkomycins containing 4-formyl-4-imidazolin-2-one as the base (nikkomycins X and I), whereas production of nikkomycins containing uracil (nikkomycins Z and J) was not affected. Nikkomycin X and I production could be restored by feeding 4-formyl-4-imidazolin-2-one to the nikQ mutants, indicating that NikQ is responsible for its formation from L-histidine. Disruption of the nikR gene resulted in formation of decreased amounts of nikkomycins X and I, whereas nikkomycins Z and J were synthesized at wild-type levels. A fluorouracil-resistant nikR mutant lacking uracil phosphoribosyltransferase (UPRTase) activity did not synthesize nikkomycins X and I and accumulated 4-formyl-4-imidazolin-2-one in its culture filtrate, whereas formation of nikkomycins Z and J was unimpaired. The mutant was complemented to nikkomycin X and I production by nikR expressed from the mel promoter of plasmid pIJ702. The nikR gene expressed in Escherichia coli led to the production of UPRTase activity. Our results indicate that NikR converts 4-formyl-4-imidazolin-2-one to yield 5'-phosphoribosyl-4-formyl-4-imidazolin-2-one, the precursor of nikkomycins containing this base.	1
Title: High-resolution NMR analysis of the conformations of native and base analog substituted retroviral and LTR-retrotransposon PPT primers Abstract: A purine-rich region of the plus-strand RNA genome of retroviruses and long terminal repeat (LTR)-containing retrotransposons, known as the polypurine tract (PPT), is resistant to hydrolysis by the RNase H domain of reverse transcriptase (RT) and ultimately serves as a primer for plus-strand DNA synthesis. The mechanisms underlying PPT resistance and selective processing remain largely unknown. Here, two RNA/DNA hybrids derived from the PPTs of HIV-1 and Ty3 were probed using high-resolution NMR for preexisting structural distortions in the absence of RT. The PPTs were selectively modified through base-pair changes or by incorporation of the thymine isostere, 2,4-difluoro-5-methylbenzene (dF), into the DNA strand. Although both wild-type (WT) and mutated hybrids adopted global A-form-like helical geometries, observed structural perturbations in the base-pair and dF-modified hybrids suggested that the PPT hybrids may function as structurally coupled domains.	0
Title: Catalytic Asymmetric Synthesis of Unprotected β2-Amino Acids Abstract: We report here a scalable, catalytic one-pot approach to enantiopure and unmodified β2-amino acids. A newly developed confined imidodiphosphorimidate (IDPi) catalyzes a broadly applicable reaction of diverse bis-silyl ketene acetals with a silylated aminomethyl ether, followed by hydrolytic workup, to give free β2-amino acids in high yields, purity, and enantioselectivity. Importantly, both aromatic and aliphatic β2-amino acids can be obtained using this method. Mechanistic studies are consistent with the aminomethylation to proceed via silylium-based asymmetric counteranion-directed catalysis (Si-ACDC) and a transition state to explain the enantioselectivity is suggested on the basis of density functional theory calculation.	0
Title: Identification and characterization of a welwitindolinone alkaloid biosynthetic gene cluster in the stigonematalean Cyanobacterium Hapalosiphon welwitschii Abstract: The identification of a 36 kb welwitindolinone (wel) biosynthetic gene cluster in Hapalosiphon welwitschii UTEX B1830 is reported. Characterization of the enzymes responsible for assembling the early biosynthetic intermediates geranyl pyrophosphate and 3-((Z)-2′-isocyanoethenyl)indole as well as a dedicated N-methyltransferase in the maturation of N-methylwelwitindolinone C isothiocyanate solidified the link between the wel pathway and welwitindolinone biosynthesis. Comparative analysis of the ambiguine and welwitindolinone biosynthetic pathways in two different organisms provided insights into the origins of diverse structures within hapalindole-type molecules.	1
Title: Retrieval of entire genes from environmental DNA by inverse PCR with pre-amplification of target genes using primers containing locked nucleic acids Abstract: We had been unsuccessful to amplify desired nucleotide sequences from various environmental DNA samples by using the inverse polymerase chain reaction (IPCR) technique, most probably because the copy numbers of target DNA sequences had been quite low. To enrich the target DNA sequences prior to IPCR, a rolling-circle amplification was used with a site-specific primer containing locked nucleic acids (LNAs). This pre-amplified IPCR (PAI-PCR) method increased the sensitivity of PCR almost 10,000 times compared with the standard IPCR in model experiments using Escherichia coli. We then applied the PAI-PCR method to isolate glycosyl hydrolase genes from DNAs extracted from vermiform appendixes of horses and termite guts. The flanking sequences of the target genes were amplified and cloned successfully using PAI-PCR, whereas standard IPCR resulted in no amplification.	0
Title: Inhibiting the protein ubiquitination cascade by ubiquitin-mimicking short peptides Abstract: Short heptapeptides were identified to function as ubiquitin (UB) mimics that are activated by E1 and form thioester conjugates with E1, E2, and HECT type E3 enzymes. The activities (k(cat)/K(1/2)) of E1 with the UB-mimicking peptides are 130-1,400-fold higher than the equally long peptide with the native C-terminal sequence of UB. By forming covalent conjugates with E1, E2, and E3 enzymes, the UB-mimicking peptides can block the transfer of native UB through the cascade.	0
Title: Functional characterization of ttmM unveils new tautomycin analogs and insight into tautomycin biosynthesis and activity Abstract: The biosynthetic gene cluster for tautomycin (TTM), a potent protein phosphatase (PP) inhibitor has recently been characterized. Inactivation of ttmM, which encodes a putative C3' hydroxylase, afforded mutant SB6005 which accumulated three new 3'-deshydroxy TTM analogs, supporting the function of TtmM and the previously proposed linear pathway for TTM biosynthesis. Bioassays reveal the importance of the C3' OH moiety in PP inhibition and that PP inhibition is not the exclusive mechanism driving TTM-induced cell death.	1
Title: Rare but active taxa contribute to community dynamics of benthic biofilms in glacier-fed streams Abstract: Glaciers harbour diverse microorganisms, which upon ice melt can be released downstream. In glacier-fed streams microorganisms can attach to stones or sediments to form benthic biofilms. We used 454-pyrosequencing to explore the bulk (16S rDNA) and putatively active (16S rRNA) microbial communities of stone and sediment biofilms across 26 glacier-fed streams. We found differences in community composition between bulk and active communities among streams and a stronger congruence between biofilm types. Relative abundances of rRNA and rDNA were positively correlated across different taxa and taxonomic levels, but at lower taxonomic levels, the higher abundance in either the active or the bulk communities became more apparent. Here, environmental variables played a minor role in structuring active communities. However, we found a large number of rare taxa with higher relative abundances in rRNA compared with rDNA. This suggests that rare taxa contribute disproportionately to microbial community dynamics in glacier-fed streams. Our findings propose that high community turnover, where taxa repeatedly enter and leave the 'seed bank', contributes to the maintenance of microbial biodiversity in harsh ecosystems with continuous environmental perturbations, such as glacier-fed streams.	0
Title: Docking domain-mediated subunit interactions in natural product megasynth(et)ases Abstract: Polyketide synthase (PKS) and non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) multienzymes produce numerous high value metabolites. The protein subunits which constitute these megasynth(et)ases must undergo ordered self-assembly to ensure correct organisation of catalytic domains for the biosynthesis of a given natural product. Short amino acid regions at the N- and C-termini of each subunit, termed docking domains (DDs), often occur in complementary pairs, which interact to facilitate substrate transfer and maintain pathway fidelity. This review details all structurally characterised examples of NRPS and PKS DDs to date and summarises efforts to utilise DDs for the engineering of biosynthetic pathways.	0
Title: Antimicrobial activity of clioquinol and nitroxoline: a scoping review Abstract: Clioquinol and nitroxoline, two drugs with numerous pharmacological properties fallen into disuse for many decades. The first was considered dangerous due to contraindications and the second mainly because was taken as ineffective, despite its known antibacterial activity. In the last decades, the advances in pharmaceutical chemistry, molecular biology, toxicology and genetics allowed to better understand the cellular action of these compounds, some toxicological issues and/or activity scopes. Thus, a new opportunity for these drugs to be considered as potential antimicrobial agents has arisen. This review contemplates the trajectory of clioquinol and nitroxoline from their emergence to the present day, emphasizing the new studies that indicate the possibility of reintroduction for specific cases.	0
Title: Cloning of a gene cluster responsible for the biosynthesis of diterpene aphidicolin, a specific inhibitor of DNA polymerase alpha Abstract: The fungal diterpene, aphidicolin, is a well-known specific inhibitor of DNA polymerase alpha. Terpenoids are an important class of natural products. However, identification of the biosynthetic gene cluster in terpenoids is relatively rare compared with another important class of natural products, polyketides. To explore a reliable identification method for the biosynthetic gene cluster in fungal diterpenoids, cloning of the biosynthetic gene cluster of aphidicolin was employed. The application of a simple PCR method for genome walking based on the sequence of cDNA encoding aphidicolan-16beta-ol synthase (ACS) allowed us to analyze a 15.6-kb region of the Phoma betae genomic DNA. Six ORFs, PbGGS, ACS, PbP450-1, PbP450-2, PbTP, and PbTF were found in this region, and respectively expected to encode geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase, diterpene synthase, two cytochrome P-450s, the transporter and transcription factor. Their amino acid sequences and introns were deduced by a corresponding cDNA analysis. This study shows that simple PCR-based genome walking without constructing a genomic DNA library is useful for identification of a small gene cluster. We propose a general strategy for the cloning the biosynthetic genes of fungal diterpenoids by using fungal GGS.	1
Title: Isolation and characterization of transposon Tn5-induced mutants of Pseudomonas perfectomarina defective in nitrous oxide respiration Abstract: Transposon (Tn5) mutagenesis of Pseudomonas perfectomarina with the plasmid pSUP2021 [(pBR325-Mob(RP4))::Tn5] and the chromosomally integrated RP4 plasmid in Escherichia coli as the donor, produced three distinct groups of mutants that were defective in nitrous oxide respiration. One group of mutants lacked the structural protein of N2O reductase, the second synthesized a copper-free apoprotein; and a third group expressed a low level of intact enzyme. The mutants provided evidence for N2O being the immediate precursor of dinitrogen in denitrification and documented the essentiality of the copper enzyme. Synthesis of N2O reductase depended strongly on the growth conditions, with N2O-grown cells expressing the lowest level of enzyme. Regulatory responses of mutants elicited by nitrate or oxygen were unaltered when compared with wild-type behavior.	0
Title: The calicheamicin gene cluster and its iterative type I enediyne PKS Abstract: The enediynes exemplify nature's ingenuity. We have cloned and characterized the biosynthetic locus coding for perhaps the most notorious member of the nonchromoprotein enediyne family, calicheamicin. This gene cluster contains an unusual polyketide synthase (PKS) that is demonstrated to be essential for enediyne biosynthesis. Comparison of the calicheamicin locus with the locus encoding the chromoprotein enediyne C-1027 reveals that the enediyne PKS is highly conserved among these distinct enediyne families. Contrary to previous hypotheses, this suggests that the chromoprotein and nonchromoprotein enediynes are generated by similar biosynthetic pathways.	1
Title: N-Carboxyanhydride Polymerization of Glycopolypeptides That Activate Antigen-Presenting Cells through Dectin-1 and Dectin-2 Abstract: The C-type lectins dectin-1 and dectin-2 contribute to innate immunity against microbial pathogens by recognizing their foreign glycan structures. These receptors are promising targets for vaccine development and cancer immunotherapy. However, currently available agonists are heterogeneous glycoconjugates and polysaccharides from natural sources. Herein, we designed and synthesized the first chemically defined ligands for dectin-1 and dectin-2. They comprised glycopolypeptides bearing mono-, di-, and trisaccharides and were built through polymerization of glycosylated N-carboxyanhydrides. Through this approach, we achieved glycopolypeptides with high molecular weights and low dispersities. We identified structures that elicit a pro-inflammatory response through dectin-1 or dectin-2 in antigen-presenting cells. With their native proteinaceous backbones and natural glycosidic linkages, these agonists are attractive for translational applications.	0
Title: Designed Conformation and Fluorescence Properties of Self-Assembled Phenazine-Cored Platinum(II) Metallacycles Abstract: A series of platinum(II) metallacycles were prepared via the coordination-driven self-assembly of a phenazine-cored dipyridyl donor with a 90° Pt(II) acceptor and various dicarboxylate donors in a 1:1:2 ratio. While the metallacycles display similar absorption profiles, they exhibit a trend of blue-shifted fluorescence emission with the decrease in the bite angles between the carboxylate building blocks. Comprehensive spectroscopic and dynamic studies as well as a computational approach were conducted, revealing that the difference in the degree of constraint imposed on the excited-state planarization of the phenazine core within these metallacycles results in their distinct photophysical behaviors. As such, a small initial difference in the dicarboxylate building blocks is amplified into distinct photophysical properties of the metallacycles, which is reminiscent of the efficient functional tuning observed in natural systems. In addition to the pre-assembly approach, the photophysical properties of a metallacycle can also be modulated using a post-assembly modification to the dicarboxylate building block, suggesting another strategy for functional tuning. This research illustrated the potential of coordination-driven self-assembly for the preparation of materials with precisely tailored functionalities at the molecular level.	0
Title: Iterative Mechanism of Macrodiolide Formation in the Anticancer Compound Conglobatin Abstract: Conglobatin is an unusual C2-symmetrical macrodiolide from the bacterium Streptomyces conglobatus with promising antitumor activity. Insights into the genes and enzymes that govern both the assembly-line production of the conglobatin polyketide and its dimerization are essential to allow rational alterations to be made to the conglobatin structure. We have used a rapid, direct in vitro cloning method to obtain the entire cluster on a 41-kbp fragment, encoding a modular polyketide synthase assembly line. The cloned cluster directs conglobatin biosynthesis in a heterologous host strain. Using a model substrate to mimic the conglobatin monomer, we also show that the conglobatin cyclase/thioesterase acts iteratively, ligating two monomers head-to-tail then re-binding the dimer product and cyclizing it. Incubation of two different monomers with the cyclase produces hybrid dimers and trimers, providing the first evidence that conglobatin analogs may in future become accessible through engineering of the polyketide synthase.	0
Title: Enzyme-catalysed [6+4] cycloadditions in the biosynthesis of natural products Abstract: Pericyclic reactions are powerful transformations for the construction of carbon-carbon and carbon-heteroatom bonds in organic synthesis. Their role in biosynthesis is increasingly apparent, and mechanisms by which pericyclases can catalyse reactions are of major interest1. [4+2] cycloadditions (Diels-Alder reactions) have been widely used in organic synthesis2 for the formation of six-membered rings and are now well-established in biosynthesis3-6. [6+4] and other 'higher-order' cycloadditions were predicted7 in 1965, and are now increasingly common in the laboratory despite challenges arising from the generation of a highly strained ten-membered ring system8,9. However, although enzyme-catalysed [6+4] cycloadditions have been proposed10-12, they have not been proven to occur. Here we demonstrate a group of enzymes that catalyse a pericyclic [6+4] cycloaddition, which is a crucial step in the biosynthesis of streptoseomycin-type natural products. This type of pericyclase catalyses [6+4] and [4+2] cycloadditions through a single ambimodal transition state, which is consistent with previous proposals11,12. The [6+4] product is transformed to a less stable [4+2] adduct via a facile Cope rearrangement, and the [4+2] adduct is converted into the natural product enzymatically. Crystal structures of three pericyclases, computational simulations of potential energies and molecular dynamics, and site-directed mutagenesis establish the mechanism of this transformation. This work shows how enzymes are able to catalyse concerted pericyclic reactions involving ambimodal transition states.	1
Title: Converting a binding protein into a biosensing conformational switch using protein fragment exchange Abstract: Biosensors can be used in applications ranging from identifying disease biomarkers to detecting spatial and temporal distributions of specific molecules in living cells. A major challenge facing biosensor development is how to functionally couple a biological recognition domain to an output module so that the binding event can be transduced to a visible and quantifiable signal [e.g., Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET)]. Most designs achieve coupling by means of a binding protein that changes conformation upon interacting with its target. This approach is limited by the fact that few proteins possess such natural allosteric mechanisms, and for those that do, the conformational change is frequently not extensive enough to produce a large change in distance between FRET donor and acceptor groups. Here, we introduce protein fragment exchange (FREX) to address both problems. FREX employs two components: a folded binding protein and a fragment duplicated from it, the latter of which can be chosen from many possible fragments. The system is rationally tuned so that addition of ligand induces a conformational change in which the fragment exchanges positions with the corresponding segment of the binding protein. Placing fluorescent donor and acceptor groups on the binding protein and fragment reduces the background level of FRET of the unbound sensor, resulting in a ratiometric FRET response that is expected to be strong and reproducible from protein to protein. FREX is demonstrated using fibronectin III, a monobody binding scaffold that has been tailored to recognize multiple targets. Sensors labeled with Alexa FRET pairs exhibit ratiometric FRET changes of up to 8.6-fold and perform equally well in buffer and serum. A genetically encoded variant of this sensor is shown to be functional in cell lysates and in mammalian cell cultures.	0
Title: Improving the coverage of the cyanobacterial phylum using diversity-driven genome sequencing Abstract: The cyanobacterial phylum encompasses oxygenic photosynthetic prokaryotes of a great breadth of morphologies and ecologies; they play key roles in global carbon and nitrogen cycles. The chloroplasts of all photosynthetic eukaryotes can trace their ancestry to cyanobacteria. Cyanobacteria also attract considerable interest as platforms for "green" biotechnology and biofuels. To explore the molecular basis of their different phenotypes and biochemical capabilities, we sequenced the genomes of 54 phylogenetically and phenotypically diverse cyanobacterial strains. Comparison of cyanobacterial genomes reveals the molecular basis for many aspects of cyanobacterial ecophysiological diversity, as well as the convergence of complex morphologies without the acquisition of novel proteins. This phylum-wide study highlights the benefits of diversity-driven genome sequencing, identifying more than 21,000 cyanobacterial proteins with no detectable similarity to known proteins, and foregrounds the diversity of light-harvesting proteins and gene clusters for secondary metabolite biosynthesis. Additionally, our results provide insight into the distribution of genes of cyanobacterial origin in eukaryotic nuclear genomes. Moreover, this study doubles both the amount and the phylogenetic diversity of cyanobacterial genome sequence data. Given the exponentially growing number of sequenced genomes, this diversity-driven study demonstrates the perspective gained by comparing disparate yet related genomes in a phylum-wide context and the insights that are gained from it.	1
Title: The role of heterologous receptors in McpB-mediated signalling in Bacillus subtilis chemotaxis Abstract: Asparagine chemotaxis in Bacillus subtilis appears to involve two partially redundant adaptation mechanisms: a receptor methylation-independent process that operates at low attractant concentrations and a receptor methylation-dependent process that is required for optimal responses to high concentrations. In order to elucidate these processes, chemotactic responses were assessed for strains expressing methylation-defective mutations in the asparagine receptor, McpB, in which all 10 putative receptors (10del), five receptors (5del) or only the native copy of mcpB were deleted. This was done in both the presence and the absence of the methylesterase CheB. We found that: (i) only responses to high concentrations of asparagine were impaired; (ii) the presence of all heterologous receptors fully compensated for this defect, whereas responses progressively worsened as more receptors were taken away; (iii) methyl-group turnover occurred on heterologous receptors after the addition of asparagine, and these methylation changes were required for the restoration of normal swimming behaviour; (iv) in the absence of the methyleste-rase, the presence of heterologous receptors in some cases caused impaired chemotaxis; and (v) either a certain threshold number of receptors must be present to promote basal CheA activity, or one or more of the receptors missing in the 10del background (but present in the 5del background) is required for establishing basal CheA activity. Taken together, these findings suggest that many or all chemoreceptors work as an ensemble that constitutes a robust chemotaxis system. We propose that the ability of non-McpB receptors to compensate for the methylation-defective McpB mutations involves lateral transmission of the adapted conformational change across the ensemble.	0
Title: Discovery of potent and selective covalent inhibitors of JNK Abstract: The mitogen-activated kinases JNK1/2/3 are key enzymes in signaling modules that transduce and integrate extracellular stimuli into coordinated cellular response. Here, we report the discovery of irreversible inhibitors of JNK1/2/3. We describe two JNK3 cocrystal structures at 2.60 and 2.97 Å resolution that show the compounds form covalent bonds with a conserved cysteine residue. JNK-IN-8 is a selective JNK inhibitor that inhibits phosphorylation of c-Jun, a direct substrate of JNK, in cells exposed to submicromolar drug in a manner that depends on covalent modification of the conserved cysteine residue. Extensive biochemical, cellular, and pathway-based profiling establish the selectivity of JNK-IN-8 for JNK and suggests that the compound will be broadly useful as a pharmacological probe of JNK-dependent signal transduction. Potential lead compounds have also been identified for kinases, including IRAK1, PIK3C3, PIP4K2C, and PIP5K3.	0
Title: Accurate prediction of the Aspergillus nidulans terrequinone gene cluster boundaries using the transcriptional regulator LaeA Abstract: LaeA is a regulatory protein of the genus Aspergillus which controls global expression of secondary metabolism gene clusters. During a previous genome-wide transcriptional profiling screen, numerous novel gene clusters were found to be regulated by LaeA including a cluster required for the production of the antitumor agent terrequinone A. Beginnings and ends of secondary metabolite gene clusters are difficult to predict by gene sequence alone, but sharp demarcation of transcriptional control by LaeA suggested this protein might present a tool to identify cluster ends. To address this possibility in a first test case, we created null mutants of three genes, one regulated and two not regulated by LaeA, lying at the first, sixth and seventh position of a contiguous seven gene region where the third gene in this continuum was already shown to be required for terrequinone A production. Only the gene regulated by LaeA, tdiE, sixth in the series, was required for terrequinone A. In this pilot experiment, these findings experimentally validate LaeA-based predictions of the terrequinone biosynthetic locus boundaries. Further, this study identifies TdiE as a protein of unknown yet essential function for terrequinone A biosynthesis.	1
Title: Atypical expansion in mice of the sensory neuron-specific Mrg G protein-coupled receptor family Abstract: The Mas-related genes (Mrgs) comprise a family of >50 G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), many of which are expressed in specific subsets of nociceptive sensory neurons in mice. In contrast, humans contain a related but nonorthologous family of genes, called MrgXs or sensory neuron-specific receptors, of which many fewer appear to be expressed in sensory neurons. To determine whether the diversity of murine Mrgs is generic to rodents or is an atypical feature of mice, we characterized MrgA, MrgB, MrgC, and MrgD subfamilies in rat and gerbil. Surprisingly, although mice have approximately 22 MrgA and approximately 14 MrgC genes, rats and gerbils have just a single MrgA and MrgC gene. This murine-specific expansion likely reflects recent retrotransposon-mediated unequal crossover events. The expression of Mrgs in rat sensory ganglia suggests that the extensive cellular diversity in mice can be simplified to a core subset of approximately four different genes (MrgA, MrgB, MrgC, and MrgD), defining a similar number of neuronal subpopulations. Our results suggest more generally that mouse-human genomic comparisons may sometimes reveal differences atypical of rodents.	0
Title: Hassallidins, antifungal glycolipopeptides, are widespread among cyanobacteria and are the end-product of a nonribosomal pathway Abstract: Cyanobacteria produce a wide variety of cyclic peptides, including the widespread hepatotoxins microcystins and nodularins. Another class of peptides, cyclic glycosylated lipopeptides called hassallidins, show antifungal activity. Previously, two hassallidins (A and B) were reported from an epilithic cyanobacterium Hassallia sp. and found to be active against opportunistic human pathogenic fungi. Bioinformatic analysis of the Anabaena sp. 90 genome identified a 59-kb cryptic inactive nonribosomal peptide synthetase gene cluster proposed to be responsible for hassallidin biosynthesis. Here we describe the hassallidin biosynthetic pathway from Anabaena sp. SYKE748A, as well as the large chemical variation and common occurrence of hassallidins in filamentous cyanobacteria. Analysis demonstrated that 20 strains of the genus Anabaena carry hassallidin synthetase genes and produce a multitude of hassallidin variants that exhibit activity against Candida albicans. The compounds discovered here were distinct from previously reported hassallidins A and B. The IC50 of hassallidin D was 0.29-1.0 µM against Candida strains. A large variation in amino acids, sugars, their degree of acetylation, and fatty acid side chain length was detected. In addition, hassallidins were detected in other cyanobacteria including Aphanizomenon, Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii, Nostoc, and Tolypothrix. These compounds may protect some of the most important bloom-forming and globally distributed cyanobacteria against attacks by parasitic fungi.	1
Title: A Potent, Selective CBX2 Chromodomain Ligand and Its Cellular Activity During Prostate Cancer Neuroendocrine Differentiation Abstract: Polycomb group (PcG) proteins are epigenetic regulators that facilitate both embryonic development and cancer progression. PcG proteins form Polycomb repressive complexes 1 and 2 (PRC1 and PRC2). PRC2 trimethylates histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27me3), a histone mark recognized by the N-terminal chromodomain (ChD) of the CBX subunit of canonical PRC1. There are five PcG CBX paralogs in humans. CBX2 in particular is upregulated in a variety of cancers, particularly in advanced prostate cancers. Using CBX2 inhibitors to understand and target CBX2 in prostate cancer is highly desirable; however, high structural similarity among the CBX ChDs has been challenging for developing selective CBX ChD inhibitors. Here, we utilize selections of focused DNA encoded libraries (DELs) for the discovery of a selective CBX2 chromodomain probe, SW2_152F. SW2_152F binds to CBX2 ChD with a Kd of 80 nM and displays 24-1000-fold selectivity for CBX2 ChD over other CBX paralogs in vitro. SW2_152F is cell permeable, selectively inhibits CBX2 chromatin binding in cells, and blocks neuroendocrine differentiation of prostate cancer cell lines in response to androgen deprivation.	0
Title: A Thioacetal Photocage Designed for Dual Release: Application in the Quantitation of Therapeutic Release by Synchronous Reporter Decaging Abstract: Despite the immense potential of existing photocaging technology, its application is limited by the paucity of advanced caging tools. Here, we report on the design of a novel thioacetal ortho-nitrobenzaldehyde (TNB) dual arm photocage that enabled control of the simultaneous release of two payloads linked to a single TNB unit. By using this cage, which was prepared in a single step from commercial 6-nitroverataldehyde, three drug-fluorophore conjugates were synthesized: Taxol-TNB-fluorescein, Taxol-TNB-coumarin, and doxorubicin-TNB-coumarin, and long-wavelength UVA light-triggered release experiments demonstrated that dual payload release occurred with rapid decay kinetics for each conjugate. In cell-based assays performed in vitro, dual release could also be controlled by UV exposure, resulting in increased cellular fluorescence and cytotoxicity with potency equal to that of unmodified drug towards the KB carcinoma cell line. The extent of such dual release was quantifiable by reporter fluorescence measured in situ and was found to correlate with the extent of cytotoxicity. Thus, this novel dual arm cage strategy provides a valuable tool that enables both active control and real-time monitoring of drug activation at the delivery site.	0
Title: Modeling of novel diagnostic strategies for active tuberculosis - a systematic review: current practices and recommendations Abstract: Introduction:                       The field of diagnostics for active tuberculosis (TB) is rapidly developing. TB diagnostic modeling can help to inform policy makers and support complicated decisions on diagnostic strategy, with important budgetary implications. Demand for TB diagnostic modeling is likely to increase, and an evaluation of current practice is important. We aimed to systematically review all studies employing mathematical modeling to evaluate cost-effectiveness or epidemiological impact of novel diagnostic strategies for active TB.                  Methods:                       Pubmed, personal libraries and reference lists were searched to identify eligible papers. We extracted data on a wide variety of model structure, parameter choices, sensitivity analyses and study conclusions, which were discussed during a meeting of content experts.                  Results & discussion:                       From 5619 records a total of 36 papers were included in the analysis. Sixteen papers included population impact/transmission modeling, 5 were health systems models, and 24 included estimates of cost-effectiveness. Transmission and health systems models included specific structure to explore the importance of the diagnostic pathway (n = 4), key determinants of diagnostic delay (n = 5), operational context (n = 5), and the pre-diagnostic infectious period (n = 1). The majority of models implemented sensitivity analysis, although only 18 studies described multi-way sensitivity analysis of more than 2 parameters simultaneously. Among the models used to make cost-effectiveness estimates, most frequent diagnostic assays studied included Xpert MTB/RIF (n = 7), and alternative nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) (n = 4). Most (n = 16) of the cost-effectiveness models compared new assays to an existing baseline and generated an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER).                  Conclusion:                       Although models have addressed a small number of important issues, many decisions regarding implementation of TB diagnostics are being made without the full benefits of insight from mathematical models. Further models are needed that address a wider array of diagnostic and epidemiological settings, that explore the inherent uncertainty of models and that include additional epidemiological data on transmission implications of false-negative diagnosis and the pre-diagnostic period.	0
Title: NADP+-Preferring D-Lactate Dehydrogenase from Sporolactobacillus inulinus Abstract: Hydroxy acid dehydrogenases, including l- and d-lactate dehydrogenases (L-LDH and D-LDH), are responsible for the stereospecific conversion of 2-keto acids to 2-hydroxyacids and extensively used in a wide range of biotechnological applications. A common feature of LDHs is their high specificity for NAD(+) as a cofactor. An LDH that could effectively use NADPH as a coenzyme could be an alternative enzymatic system for regeneration of the oxidized, phosphorylated cofactor. In this study, a d-lactate dehydrogenase from a Sporolactobacillus inulinus strain was found to use both NADH and NADPH with high efficiencies and with a preference for NADPH as its coenzyme, which is different from the coenzyme utilization of all previously reported LDHs. The biochemical properties of the D-LDH enzyme were determined by X-ray crystal structural characterization and in vivo and in vitro enzymatic activity analyses. The residue Asn(174) was demonstrated to be critical for NADPH utilization. Characterization of the biochemical properties of this enzyme will contribute to understanding of the catalytic mechanism and provide referential information for shifting the coenzyme utilization specificity of 2-hydroxyacid dehydrogenases.	0
Title: Evolution of structural diversity of trichothecenes, a family of toxins produced by plant pathogenic and entomopathogenic fungi Abstract: Trichothecenes are a family of terpenoid toxins produced by multiple genera of fungi, including plant and insect pathogens. Some trichothecenes produced by the fungus Fusarium are among the mycotoxins of greatest concern to food and feed safety because of their toxicity and frequent occurrence in cereal crops, and trichothecene production contributes to pathogenesis of some Fusarium species on plants. Collectively, fungi produce over 150 trichothecene analogs: i.e., molecules that share the same core structure but differ in patterns of substituents attached to the core structure. Here, we carried out genomic, phylogenetic, gene-function, and analytical chemistry studies of strains from nine fungal genera to identify genetic variation responsible for trichothecene structural diversity and to gain insight into evolutionary processes that have contributed to the variation. The results indicate that structural diversity has resulted from gain, loss, and functional changes of trichothecene biosynthetic (TRI) genes. The results also indicate that the presence of some substituents has arisen independently in different fungi by gain of different genes with the same function. Variation in TRI gene duplication and number of TRI loci was also observed among the fungi examined, but there was no evidence that such genetic differences have contributed to trichothecene structural variation. We also inferred ancestral states of the TRI cluster and trichothecene biosynthetic pathway, and proposed scenarios for changes in trichothecene structures during divergence of TRI cluster homologs. Together, our findings provide insight into evolutionary processes responsible for structural diversification of toxins produced by pathogenic fungi.	1
Title: Identification of two genes from Streptomyces argillaceus encoding glycosyltransferases involved in transfer of a disaccharide during biosynthesis of the antitumor drug mithramycin Abstract: Mithramycin is an antitumor polyketide drug produced by Streptomyces argillaceus that contains two deoxysugar chains, a disaccharide consisting of two D-olivoses and a trisaccharide consisting of a D-olivose, a D-oliose, and a D-mycarose. From a cosmid clone (cosAR3) which confers resistance to mithramycin in streptomycetes, a 3-kb PstI-XhoI fragment was sequenced, and two divergent genes (mtmGI and mtmGII) were identified. Comparison of the deduced products of both genes with proteins in databases showed similarities with glycosyltransferases and glucuronosyltransferases from different sources, including several glycosyltransferases involved in sugar transfer during antibiotic biosynthesis. Both genes were independently inactivated by gene replacement, and the mutants generated (M3G1 and M3G2) did not produce mithramycin. High-performance liquid chromatography analysis of ethyl acetate extracts of culture supernatants of both mutants showed the presence of several peaks with the characteristic spectra of mithramycin biosynthetic intermediates. Four compounds were isolated from both mutants by preparative high-performance liquid chromatography, and their structures were elucidated by physicochemical methods. The structures of these compounds were identical in both mutants, and the compounds are suggested to be glycosylated intermediates of mithramycin biosynthesis with different numbers of sugar moieties attached to C-12a-O of a tetracyclic mithramycin precursor and to C-2-O of mithramycinone: three tetracyclic intermediates containing one sugar (premithramycin A1), two sugars (premithramycin A2), or three sugars (premithramycin A3) and one tricyclic intermediate containing a trisaccharide chain (premithramycin A4). It is proposed that the glycosyltransferases encoded by mtmGI and mtmGII are responsible for forming and transferring the disaccharide during mithramycin biosynthesis. From the structures of the new metabolites, a new biosynthetic sequence regarding late steps of mithramycin biosynthesis can be suggested, a sequence which includes glycosyl transfer steps prior to the final shaping of the aglycone moiety of mithramycin.	1
Title: Bell's theorem for temporal order Abstract: Time has a fundamentally different character in quantum mechanics and in general relativity. In quantum theory events unfold in a fixed order while in general relativity temporal order is influenced by the distribution of matter. When matter requires a quantum description, temporal order is expected to become non-classical-a scenario beyond the scope of current theories. Here we provide a direct description of such a scenario. We consider a thought experiment with a massive body in a spatial superposition and show how it leads to entanglement of temporal orders between time-like events. This entanglement enables accomplishing a task, violation of a Bell inequality, that is impossible under local classical temporal order; it means that temporal order cannot be described by any pre-defined local variables. A classical notion of a causal structure is therefore untenable in any framework compatible with the basic principles of quantum mechanics and classical general relativity.	0
Title: Organomercury Nucleic Acids: Past, Present and Future Abstract: Synthetic efforts towards nucleosides, nucleotides, oligonucleotides and nucleic acids covalently mercurated at one or more of their base moieties are summarized, followed by a discussion of the proposed, realized and abandoned applications of this unique class of compounds. Special emphasis is given to fields in which active research is ongoing, notably the use of HgII -mediated base pairing to improve the hybridization properties of oligonucleotide probes. Finally, this minireview attempts to anticipate potential future applications of organomercury nucleic acids.	0
Title: Semi-Rationally Designed Short Peptides Self-Assemble and Bind Hemin to Promote Cyclopropanation Abstract: The self-assembly of short peptides gives rise to versatile nanoassemblies capable of promoting efficient catalysis. We have semi-rationally designed a series of seven-residue peptides that form hemin-binding catalytic amyloids to facilitate enantioselective cyclopropanation with efficiencies that rival those of engineered hemin proteins. These results demonstrate that: 1) Catalytic amyloids can bind complex metallocofactors to promote practically important multisubstrate transformations. 2) Even essentially flat surfaces of amyloid assemblies can impart a substantial degree of enantioselectivity without the need for extensive optimization. 3) The ease of peptide preparation allows for straightforward incorporation of unnatural amino acids and the preparation of peptides made from d-amino acids with complete reversal of enantioselectivity.	0
Title: Food-Poisoning Bacteria Employ a Citrate Synthase and a Type II NRPS To Synthesize Bolaamphiphilic Lipopeptide Antibiotics* Abstract: Mining the genome of the food-spoiling bacterium Burkholderia gladioli pv. cocovenenans revealed five nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) gene clusters, including an orphan gene locus (bol). Gene inactivation and metabolic profiling linked the bol gene cluster to novel bolaamphiphilic lipopeptides with antimycobacterial activity. A combination of chemical analysis and bioinformatics elucidated the structures of bolagladin A and B, lipocyclopeptides featuring an unusual dehydro-β-alanine enamide linker fused to an unprecedented tricarboxylic fatty acid tail. Through a series of targeted gene deletions, we proved the involvement of a designated citrate synthase (CS), priming ketosynthases III (KS III), a type II NRPS, including a novel desaturase for enamide formation, and a multimodular NRPS in generating the cyclopeptide. Network analyses revealed the evolutionary origin of the CS and identified cryptic CS/NRPS gene loci in various bacterial genomes.	1
Title: Discovery of Cryptic Largimycins in Streptomyces Reveals Novel Biosynthetic Avenues Enriching the Structural Diversity of the Leinamycin Family Abstract: Largimycins are hybrid nonribosomal peptide-polyketides that constitute a new group of metabolites in the leinamycin family of natural products displaying unique structural features such as containing an oxazole instead of a thiazole ring or being oxime ester macrocycles, unprecedented in nature, rather than macrolactams. Their discovery in Streptomyces argillaceus and Streptomyces canus has relied on the activation of two homologous silent gene clusters by overexpressing a transcriptional activator and cultivating in specific media. The proposed biosynthesis of largimycins includes the key action of the oxidoreductase LrgO, responsible for the formation of the oxime group involved in macrocyclization, and two putative cryptic biosynthetic steps consisting of chlorination of l-Thr by the NRPS loading module and incorporation of an olefinic exomethylene group by LrgJ PKS. The discovery of largimycins uncovers novel biosynthetic avenues employed in nature to enrich the structural diversity of leinamycins and provides tools for combinatorial biosynthesis.	1
Title: The antiviral protein cyanovirin-N: the current state of its production and applications Abstract: Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/AIDS continues to spread worldwide, and most of the HIV-infected people living in developing countries have little or no access to highly active antiretroviral therapy. The development of efficient and low-cost microbicides to prevent sexual transmission of HIV should be given high priority because there is no vaccine available yet. Cyanovirin-N (CVN) is an entry inhibitor of HIV and many other viruses, and it represents a new generation of microbicide that has specific and potent activity, a different mechanism of action, and unusual chemicophysical stability. In vitro and in vivo antiviral tests suggested that the anti-HIV effect of CVN is stronger than a well-known gp120-targeted antibody (2G12) and another microbicide candidate, PRO2000. CVN is a cyanobacteria-derived protein that has special structural features, making the artificial production of this protein very difficult. In order to develop an efficient and relatively low-cost approach for large-scale production of recombinant CVN to satisfy medical use, this protein has been expressed in many systems by trial and error. Here, to summarize the potential and remaining challenges for the development of this protein into an HIV prevention agent, the progress in the structural mechanism determination, heterologous production and pharmacological evaluation of CVN is reviewed.	0
Title: Mechanistic insights into the LsrK kinase required for autoinducer-2 quorum sensing activation Abstract: In enteric bacteria, the kinase LsrK catalyzes the phosphorylation of the C5-hydroxyl group in the linear form of 4,5-dihydroxy-2,3-pentanedione (DPD), the precursor of the type II bacterial quorum sensing molecule (AI-2). This phosphorylation is required for AI-2 sequestration in the cytoplasm and subsequent derepression of AI-2-related genes necessary for quorum development. While LsrK is a critical enzyme within the DPD quorum sensing relay system, kinetic details of this kinase have yet to be reported. A continuous UV-vis spectrophotometric assay was developed that allowed steady-state kinetic analysis of LsrK to be undertaken with the substrates ATP and DPD. The data was most consistent with a rapid equilibrium ordered mechanism with ATP binding first: kcat (7.4 ± 0.6 s(-1)), Km,ATP (150 ± 30 μM) and Km(app),DPD (1.0 ± 0.2 mM). The assay also allowed a DPD substrate profile to be conducted, which provided an unexpected biochemical disconnect between the previous agonist/antagonist cell-based reporter assay and the LsrK assay presented herein. Together these findings raise the importance of LsrK and lay the foundation not only for further understanding of this enzyme and its critical biological role but also for the rational design of regulatory molecules targeting AI-2 quorum sensing in pathogenic bacteria.	0
Title: The albonoursin gene Cluster of S noursei biosynthesis of diketopiperazine metabolites independent of nonribosomal peptide synthetases Abstract: Albonoursin [cyclo(deltaPhe-DeltaLeu)], an antibacterial peptide produced by Streptomyces noursei, is one of the simplest representatives of the large diketopiperazine (DKP) family. Formation of alpha,beta unsaturations was previously shown to occur on cyclo(L-Phe-L-Leu), catalyzed by the cyclic dipeptide oxidase (CDO). We used CDO peptide sequence information to isolate a 3.8 kb S. noursei DNA fragment that directs albonoursin biosynthesis in Streptomyces lividans. This fragment encompasses four complete genes: albA and albB, necessary for CDO activity; albC, sufficient for cyclic dipeptide precursor formation, although displaying no similarity to non ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) genes; and albD, encoding a putative membrane protein. This first isolated DKP biosynthetic gene cluster should help to elucidate the mechanism of DKP formation, totally independent of NRPS, and to characterize novel DKP biosynthetic pathways that could be engineered to increase the molecular diversity of DKP derivatives.	1
Title: Three pleiotropic loci associated with bone mineral density and lean body mass Abstract: Both bone mineral density (BMD) and lean body mass (LBM) are important physiological measures with strong genetic determination. Besides, BMD and LBM might have common genetic factors. Aiming to identify pleiotropic genomic loci underlying BMD and LBM, we performed bivariate genome-wide association study meta-analyses of femoral neck bone mineral density and LBM at arms and legs, and replicated in the large-scale UK Biobank cohort sample. Combining the results from discovery meta-analysis and replication sample, we identified three genomic loci at the genome-wide significance level (p < 5.0 × 10-8): 2p23.2 (lead SNP rs4477866, discovery p = 3.47 × 10-8, replication p = 1.03 × 10-4), 16q12.2 (rs1421085, discovery p = 2.04 × 10-9, replication p = 6.47 × 10-14) and 18q21.32 (rs11152213, discovery p = 3.47 × 10-8, replication p = 6.69 × 10-6). Our findings not only provide useful insights into lean mass and bone mass development, but also enhance our understanding of the potential genetic correlation between BMD and LBM.	0
Title: Mechanical transition from α-helical coiled coils to β-sheets in fibrin(ogen) Abstract: We characterized the α-to-β transition in α-helical coiled-coil connectors of the human fibrin(ogen) molecule using biomolecular simulations of their forced elongation and theoretical modeling. The force (F)-extension (X) profiles show three distinct regimes: (1) the elastic regime, in which the coiled coils act as entropic springs (F < 100-125 pN; X < 7-8 nm); (2) the constant-force plastic regime, characterized by a force-plateau (F ≈ 150 pN; X ≈ 10-35 nm); and (3) the nonlinear regime (F > 175-200 pN; X > 40-50 nm). In the plastic regime, the three-stranded α-helices undergo a noncooperative phase transition to form parallel three-stranded β-sheets. The critical extension of the α-helices is 0.25 nm, and the energy difference between the α-helices and β-sheets is 4.9 kcal/mol per helical pitch. The soft α-to-β phase transition in coiled coils might be a universal mechanism underlying mechanical properties of filamentous α-helical proteins.	0
Title: On the regioselectivity of thioether formation by lacticin 481 synthetase Abstract: Lantibiotic synthetases generate intramolecular thioether cross-links within peptides through the Michael-type addition of cysteines onto dehydroamino acids originating from Ser and Thr. Presented here is an assay that readily distinguishes between enzymatic and nonenzymatic formation of these cross-links. The results demonstrate unequivocally that lacticin 481 synthetase can generate non-native thioether cross-links.	0
Title: Solution structure of acidocin B, a circular bacteriocin produced by Lactobacillus acidophilus M46 Abstract: Acidocin B, a bacteriocin produced by Lactobacillus acidophilus M46, was originally reported to be a linear peptide composed of 59 amino acid residues. However, its high sequence similarity to gassericin A, a circular bacteriocin from Lactobacillus gasseri LA39, suggested that acidocin B might be circular as well. Acidocin B was purified from culture supernatant by a series of hydrophobic interaction chromatographic steps. Its circular nature was ascertained by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry and tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) sequencing. The peptide sequence was found to consist of 58 amino acids with a molecular mass of 5,621.5 Da. The sequence of the acidocin B biosynthetic gene cluster was also determined and showed high nucleotide sequence similarity to that of gassericin A. The nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) solution structure of acidocin B in sodium dodecyl sulfate micelles was elucidated, revealing that it is composed of four α-helices of similar length that are folded to form a compact, globular bundle with a central pore. This is a three-dimensional structure for a member of subgroup II circular bacteriocins, which are classified based on their isoelectric points of ∼7 or lower. Comparison of acidocin B with carnocyclin A, a subgroup I circular bacteriocin with four α-helices and a pI of 10, revealed differences in the overall folding. The observed variations could be attributed to inherent diversity in their physical properties, which also required the use of different solvent systems for three-dimensional structural elucidation.	1
Title: A Proteomic Connectivity Map for Characterizing the Tumor Adaptive Response to Small Molecule Chemical Perturbagens Abstract: A powerful means to understand the cellular function of corrupt oncogenic signaling programs requires perturbing the system and monitoring the downstream consequences. Here, using a unique pair of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)/normal lung epithelial patient-derived cell lines (HCC4017/HBEC30KT), we systematically interrogated the remodeling of the NSCLC proteome upon treatment with 35 chemical perturbagens targeting a diverse array of mechanistic classes. HCC4017 and HBEC30KT cells differ significantly in their proteomic response to the same compound treatment. Using protein covariance analyses, we identified a large number of functional protein networks. For example, we found that a poorly studied protein, C5orf22, is a novel component of the WBP11/PQBP1 splicing complex. Depletion of C5orf22 leads to the aberrant splicing and expression of genes involved in cell growth and immunomodulation. In summary, we show that by systematically measuring the tumor adaptive responses at the proteomic level, an understanding could be generated that provides critical circuit-level biological insights for these pharmacologic perturbagens.	0
Title: The ABC transporter gene in the sirodesmin biosynthetic gene cluster of Leptosphaeria maculans is not essential for sirodesmin production but facilitates self-protection Abstract: Epipolythiodioxopiperazine toxins are secreted by a range of fungi, including Leptosphaeria maculans, which produces sirodesmin, and Aspergillus fumigatus, which produces gliotoxin. The L. maculans biosynthetic gene cluster for sirodesmin includes an ABC transporter gene, sirA. Disruption of this gene led to increased secretion of sirodesmin into the medium and an altered ratio of sirodesmin to its immediate precursor. The transcription pattern of a peptide synthetase that catalyses an early step in sirodesmin biosynthesis was elevated in the sirA mutant by 47% over a 7-day period. This was consistent with the finding that the transporter mutant had elevated sirodesmin levels. Despite increased production of sirodesmin, the sirA mutant was more sensitive to both sirodesmin and gliotoxin. The putative gliotoxin transporter gene, gliA, (a major facilitator superfamily transporter) from A. fumigatus complemented the tolerance of the L. maculans sirA mutant to gliotoxin, but not to sirodesmin. The results indicate that SirA contributes to self-protection against sirodesmin in L. maculans and suggest a transporter other than SirA is primarily responsible for efflux of endogenously produced sirodesmin.	1
Title: Seasonal Dynamics of Bacterial Colonization of Cotton Fiber and Effects of Moisture on Growth of Bacteria within the Cotton Boll Abstract: A highly replicated 3-year field study was conducted to determine the seasonal patterns of bacterial colonization of cotton fiber from the time of dehiscence of the bolls (the point at which the bolls just begin to open) through harvest and commercial ginning. Bacterial numbers on fiber samples from 16 plots were determined by dilution pour plating with tryptic soy agar containing cycloheximide, and numbers of gram-negative bacteria were determined by plating on tryptic soy agar containing vancomycin and cycloheximide. Populations of bacteria varied from year to year, but in all three seasons the pattern of colonization was generally a pattern consisting of a rapid increase following opening of the bolls and a more or less stable number thereafter throughout the growing season. Gram-negative bacteria accounted for 50% or more of the recoverable bacterial population. We hypothesized that the luxuriant bacterial flora developed as a result of the availability of sufficient free water in the bolls to allow bacterial proliferation with the carbon sources remaining after fiber maturation. Therefore, laboratory experiments were conducted to determine the threshold moisture level allowing growth of bacteria on fiber in the bolls. Bacterial proliferation occurred when as little as 2% moisture was added to air-dried fiber. Using simulated bolls, we demonstrated bacterial growth resulting from dew formation on fiber held in controlled-humidity chambers.	0
Title: Search for cell motility and angiogenesis inhibitors with potential anticancer activity: beauvericin and other constituents of two endophytic strains of Fusarium oxysporum Abstract: Wound-healing assay-guided fractionation of an EtOAc extract of the fungal strain Fusarium oxysporum EPH2RAA endophytic in Ephedra fasciculata afforded beauvericin (1), (-)-oxysporidinone (2), and two new N-methyl-2-pyridones, (-)-4,6'-anhydrooxysporidinone (3) and (-)-6-deoxyoxysporidinone (4). Beauvericin (1) inhibited migration of the metastatic prostate cancer (PC-3M) and breast cancer (MDA-MB-231) cells and showed antiangiogenic activity in HUVEC-2 cells at sublethal concentrations. Cytotoxicity-guided fractionation of an EtOAc extract of F. oxysporum strain CECIS occurring in Cylindropuntia echinocarpus afforded rhodolamprometrin (5), bikaverin (6), and the new natural product 6-deoxybikaverin (7). All compounds were evaluated for cytotoxicity in a panel of four sentinel cancer cell lines, NCI-H460 (non-small-cell lung), MIA Pa Ca-2 (pancreatic), MCF-7 (breast), and SF-268 (CNS glioma), and only beauvericin (1) and bikaverin (6) were active, with 1 and 6 showing selective toxicity toward NCI-H460 and MIA Pa Ca-2, respectively. Interestingly, 6-deoxybikaverin (7) was completely devoid of activity, suggesting the requirement of the C-6 hydroxy group of bikaverin for its cytotoxic activity.	0
Title: Nonregular structure-property relationships for inclusion parameters of tert-butylcalix[5]arene Abstract: The effect of macrocycle size on the structure-property relationships was studied for inclusion compounds of tert-butylcalix[n]arenes (n=4,5) with volatile organic guests having various molecular size and group composition. Vapor-sorption isotherms, guest-inclusion stoichiometry and Gibbs energy, thermostability parameters and decomposition enthalpies were determined for host-guest compounds (clathrates) obtained using saturation of solid calixarene powder with guest vapor. The increase of the host macrocycle in the studied calixarene pair changes the observed structure-property relationship from the guest-binding selectivity mostly seen in inclusion Gibbs energy to the high sensitivity for guest structure in inclusion stoichiometry. The host with the larger macrocycle has more clathrates with stepwise formation and decomposition. Specific types of guest binding with solid hosts are discussed.	0
Title: Cereulide synthesis in emetic Bacillus cereus is controlled by the transition state regulator AbrB, but not by the virulence regulator PlcR Abstract: Cereulide, a depsipeptide structurally related to the antibiotic valinomycin, is responsible for the emetic type of gastrointestinal disease caused by Bacillus cereus. Recently, it has been shown that cereulide is produced non-ribosomally by the plasmid-encoded peptide synthetase Ces. Using deletion mutants of the emetic reference strain B. cereus F4810/72, the influence of the well-known transcription factors PlcR, Spo0A and AbrB on cereulide production and on the transcription of the cereulide synthetase gene cluster was investigated. Our data demonstrate that cereulide synthesis is independent of the B. cereus specific virulence regulator PlcR but belongs to the Spo0A-AbrB regulon. Although cereulide production turned out to be independent of sporulation, it required the activity of the sporulation factor Spo0A. The sigma(A)-promoted transcription of spo0A was found to be crucial for cereulide production, while the sigma(H)-driven transcription of spo0A did not affect cereulide synthesis. Overexpression of the transition state factor AbrB in B. cereus F4810/72 resulted in a non-toxic phenotype. Moreover, AbrB was shown to bind efficiently to the main promoter region of the ces operon, indicating that AbrB acts as a repressor of cereulide production by negatively affecting ces transcription.	1
Title: Targeted capture and heterologous expression of the Pseudoalteromonas alterochromide gene cluster in Escherichia coli represents a promising natural product exploratory platform Abstract: Marine pseudoalteromonads represent a very promising source of biologically important natural product molecules. To access and exploit the full chemical capacity of these cosmopolitan Gram-(-) bacteria, we sought to apply universal synthetic biology tools to capture, refactor, and express biosynthetic gene clusters for the production of complex organic compounds in reliable host organisms. Here, we report a platform for the capture of proteobacterial gene clusters using a transformation-associated recombination (TAR) strategy coupled with direct pathway manipulation and expression in Escherichia coli. The ~34 kb pathway for production of alterochromide lipopeptides by Pseudoalteromonas piscicida JCM 20779 was captured and heterologously expressed in E. coli utilizing native and E. coli-based T7 promoter sequences. Our approach enabled both facile production of the alterochromides and in vivo interrogation of gene function associated with alterochromide's unusual brominated lipid side chain. This platform represents a simple but effective strategy for the discovery and biosynthetic characterization of natural products from marine proteobacteria.	1
Title: Moxifloxacin population pharmacokinetics in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis and the effect of intermittent high-dose rifapentine Abstract: We described the population pharmacokinetics of moxifloxacin and the effect of high-dose intermittent rifapentine in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis who were randomized to a continuation-phase regimen of 400 mg moxifloxacin and 900 mg rifapentine twice weekly or 400 mg moxifloxacin and 1,200 mg rifapentine once weekly. A two-compartment model with transit absorption best described moxifloxacin pharmacokinetics. Although rifapentine increased the clearance of moxifloxacin by 8% during antituberculosis treatment compared to that after treatment completion without rifapentine, it did not result in a clinically significant change in moxifloxacin exposure.	0
Title: Adherence to host extracellular matrix and serum components by Enterococcus faecium isolates of diverse origin Abstract: Enterococcus faecium has emerged as an important cause of nosocomial infections over the last two decades. We recently demonstrated collagen type I (CI) as a common adherence target for some E. faecium isolates and a significant correlation was found to exist between acm-mediated CI adherence and clinical origin. Here, we evaluated 60 diverse E. faecium isolates for their adherence to up to 15 immobilized host extracellular matrix and serum components. Adherence phenotypes were most commonly observed to fibronectin (Fn) (20% of the 60 isolates), fibrinogen (17%) and laminin (Ln) (13%), while only one or two of the isolates adhered to collagen type V (CV), transferrin or lactoferrin and none to the other host components tested. Adherence to Fn and Ln was almost exclusively restricted to clinical isolates, especially the endocarditis-enriched nosocomial genogroup clonal complex 17 (CC17). Thus, the ability to adhere to Fn and Ln, in addition to CI, may have contributed to the emergence and adaptation of E. faecium, in particular CC17, as a nosocomial pathogen.	0
Title: Elevation of glucosamine 6-phosphate synthetase activity in bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis in hamsters Abstract: The single intratracheal instillation of bleomycin sulfate (0.5 mg (potency) per 100 g body weight) in hamsters rapidly increased the activity of glucosamine 6-phosphate synthetase (EC 2.6.1.16) of the lung, a major regulatory enzyme for the synthesis of acidic glycosaminoglycan (AGAG). The activity increased as early as day 2, reached maximum level at day 10, then decreased and returned to the control level at day 45. The content of AGAG was also increased by bleomycin treatment, but the increase of AGAG followed the elevation of the enzyme activity. These results suggest that the early elevation of glucosamine 6-phosphate synthetase activity is closely related to the accumulation of AGAG in the fibrosing lung caused by bleomycin.	0
Title: Gold-catalyzed enantioselective ring-expanding cycloisomerization of cyclopropylidene bearing 1,5-enynes Abstract: An enantioselective ring-expanding cycloisomerization of 1,5-enynes bearing a cyclopropylidene moiety has been developed. This methodology provides a new approach to bicyclo[4.2.0]octanes, a structural motif present in many biologically active natural products.	0
Title: Glucose metabolism in the yeast Schwanniomyces castellii: role of phosphorylation site I and an alternative respiratory pathway Abstract: Glucose metabolism in a Crabtree-negative yeast, Schwanniomyces castellii, and a cytochrome b-deficient mutant of this strain was investigated in chemostat culture. The wild-type and mutant strains exhibited the same behavior. Oxidative metabolism was observed when the substrate uptake rate (qS) was low. Fermentative metabolites were excreted when the qS value was higher than 0.40 g.g-1.h-1, indicating the occurrence of a respirofermentative metabolism; however, the respiratory quotient (RQ) remained near 1. When fermentation occurred, the cytochrome pathway was repressed but not the salicylhydroxamic acid (SHAM)-sensitive pathway. The presence of an alternative SHAM-sensitive respiratory pathway and the presence of phosphorylation site I in all metabolic conditions explained the RQ value of 1 and accounted for high biomass yields in oxidative metabolism conditions (0.62 g.g-1 for the wild-type strain and 0.31 g.g-1 for the cytochrome b-deficient mutant strain).	0
Title: Agrobacterium bioassay strain for ultrasensitive detection of N-acylhomoserine lactone-type quorum-sensing molecules: detection of autoinducers in Mesorhizobium huakuii Abstract: An ultrasensitive bioassay system for the detection of N-acylhomoserine lactones (AHLs) was constructed in Agrobacterium tumefaciens by using the T7 expression system to overproduce the AHL receptor TraR. This strain detected many diverse AHLs, some at extremely low concentrations. We used this strain to detect for the first time AHLs made by Mesorhizobium huakuii, which symbiotically fixes nitrogen in association with the legume Astragalus sinicus, a source of green manure throughout eastern Asia.	0
Title: Primary structure of a putative serine protease specific for IGF-binding proteins Abstract: From a subtracted cDNA library we have isolated a cDNA clone coding for a novel transformation-sensitive protein which is expressed by human fibroblasts, but not by their matched SV40 transformed counterparts. This protein has a molecular mass of 51 kDa and is highly related to the HtrA family of serine proteases from bacteria. At the N-terminal end, it contains an IGF-binding domain which may modulate the activity of the associated serine protease. Our data are consistent with the assumption that the novel protein represents one of the proteases that regulate the availability of IGFs by cleaving IGF-binding proteins.	0
Title: Metabolic and evolutionary origin of actin-binding polyketides from diverse organisms Abstract: Actin-targeting macrolides comprise a large, structurally diverse group of cytotoxins isolated from remarkably dissimilar micro- and macroorganisms. In spite of their disparate origins and structures, many of these compounds bind actin at the same site and exhibit structural relationships reminiscent of modular, combinatorial drug libraries. Here we investigate biosynthesis and evolution of three compound groups: misakinolides, scytophycin-type compounds and luminaolides. For misakinolides from the sponge Theonella swinhoei WA, our data suggest production by an uncultivated 'Entotheonella' symbiont, further supporting the relevance of these bacteria as sources of bioactive polyketides and peptides in sponges. Insights into misakinolide biosynthesis permitted targeted genome mining for other members, providing a cyanobacterial luminaolide producer as the first cultivated source for this dimeric compound family. The data indicate that this polyketide family is bacteria-derived and that the unusual macrolide diversity is the result of combinatorial pathway modularity for some compounds and of convergent evolution for others.	1
Title: Biphasic control logic of HAMP domain signalling in the Escherichia coli serine chemoreceptor Abstract: HAMP domains mediate input-output communication in many bacterial signalling proteins. To explore the dynamic bundle model of HAMP signalling (Zhou et al., Mol. Microbiol. 73: 801, 2009), we characterized the signal outputs of 118 HAMP missense mutants of the serine chemoreceptor, Tsr, by flagellar rotation patterns. Receptors with proline or charged amino acid replacements at critical hydrophobic packing residues in the AS1 and AS2 HAMP helices had locked kinase-off outputs, indicating that drastic destabilization of the Tsr-HAMP bundle prevents kinase activation, both in the absence and presence of the sensory adaptation enzymes, CheB and CheR. Attractant-mimic lesions that enhance the structural stability of the HAMP bundle also suppressed kinase activity, demonstrating that Tsr-HAMP has two kinase-off output states at opposite extremes of its stability range. HAMP mutants with locked-on kinase outputs appeared to have intermediate bundle stabilities, implying a biphasic relationship between HAMP stability and kinase activity. Some Tsr-HAMP mutant receptors exhibited reversed output responses to CheB and CheR action that are readily explained by a biphasic control logic. The findings of this study provide strong support for a three-state dynamic bundle model of HAMP signalling in Tsr, and possibly in other bacterial transducers as well.	0
Title: Total synthesis of herboxidiene/GEX 1A Abstract: A convergent enantioselective synthesis of herboxidiene/GEX 1A (1) is described that features a double stereodifferentiating crotylation, [4 + 2] annulation, and a silicon-based sp2-sp2 cross-coupling to assemble the conjugated diene.	0
Title: Effect of increased dosage of the ML-236B (compactin) biosynthetic gene cluster on ML-236B production in Penicillium citrinum Abstract: The gene cluster responsible for ML-236B (compactin) biosynthesis has recently been characterized from P. citrinum No. 41520. Here, we describe how the ML-236B-producing strain was improved using a cosmid-mediated recombination technique. The introduction of the cosmid pML48, which contains seven of the nine ML-236B biosynthetic genes, into P. citrinum No. 41520 resulted in transformants which produced increased amounts of ML-236B. Southern analysis showed that pML48 had been incorporated by a homologous recombination event, and all high producers possessed two copies of each of the seven genes, mlcA- mlcF and mlcR, suggesting that increased dosage of the biosynthetic gene cluster was responsible for the enhanced production of ML-236B. On the other hand, various kinds of mutants with decreased titers of ML-236B were also obtained. Characterization of one such mutant, designated as T48.28, which was more sensitive to ML-236B than the parental strain, suggested that one of the ML-236B biosynthetic genes, mlcD, which encodes a putative HMG-CoA reductase, was involved in conferring resistance to ML-236B.	1
Title: Effects of cardiotrophin on adipocytes Abstract: Cardiotrophin (CT-1) is a naturally occurring protein member of the interleukin (IL)-6 cytokine family and signals through the gp130/leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR) heterodimer. The formation of gp130/LIFR complex triggers the auto/trans-phosphorylation of associated Janus kinases, leading to the activation of Janus kinase/STAT and MAPK (ERK1 and -2) signaling pathways. Since adipocytes express both gp130 and LIFR proteins and are responsive to other IL-6 family cytokines, we examined the effects of CT-1 on 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Our studies have shown that CT-1 administration results in a dose- and time-dependent activation and nuclear translocation of STAT1, -3, -5A, and -5B as well as ERK1 and -2. We also confirmed the ability of CT-1 to induce signaling in fat cells in vivo. Our studies revealed that neither CT-1 nor ciliary neurotrophic factor treatment affected adipocyte differentiation. However, acute CT-1 treatment caused an increase in SOCS-3 mRNA in adipocytes and a transient decrease in peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) mRNA that was regulated by the binding of STAT1 to the PPARgamma2 promoter. The effects of CT-1 on SOCS-3 and PPARgamma mRNA were independent of MAPK activation. Chronic administration of CT-1 to 3T3-L1 adipocytes resulted in a decrease of both fatty acid synthase and insulin receptor substrate-1 protein expression yet did not effect the expression of a variety of other adipocyte proteins. Moreover, chronic CT-1 treatment resulted in the development of insulin resistance as judged by a decrease in insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. In summary, CT-1 is a potent regulator of signaling in adipocytes in vitro and in vivo, and our current efforts are focused on determining the role of this cardioprotective cytokine on adipocyte physiology.	0
Title: An E. coli biosensor for screening of cDNA libraries for isochorismate pyruvate lyase-encoding cDNAs Abstract: Salicylic acid (SA) is an essential hormone for development and induced defense against biotrophic pathogens in plants. The formation of SA mainly derives from chorismate via demonstrated isochorismate synthase (ICS) and presumed isochorismate pyruvate lyase (IPL)-mediated steps in Arabidopsis thaliana, but so far no plant enzyme displaying IPL activity has been identified. Here, we developed an E. coli SA biosensor to screen for IPL activity based on the SalR regulator/salA promoter combination from Acinetobacter sp ADP1, to control the expression of the reporter luxCDABE. The biosensor was responsive to micromolar concentrations of exogenous SA, and to endogenous SA produced after transformation with a plasmid permitting IPTG-inducible expression of bacterial IPL in this biosensor strain. After screening a cDNA library constructed from turnip crinkle virus (TCV)-infected Arabidopsis ecotype Di-17, we identified an enzyme, PRXR1, as a putative IPL that converts isochorismate into SA. Our results provide a new experimental approach to identify IPL and new insights into the SA biosynthesis pathway in Arabidopsis.	0
Title: An N-nitrosating metalloenzyme constructs the pharmacophore of streptozotocin Abstract: Small molecules containing the N-nitroso group, such as the bacterial natural product streptozotocin, are prominent carcinogens1,2 and important cancer chemotherapeutics3,4. Despite the considerable importance of this functional group to human health, enzymes dedicated to the assembly of the N-nitroso unit have not been identified. Here we show that SznF, a metalloenzyme from the biosynthesis of streptozotocin, catalyses an oxidative rearrangement of the guanidine group of Nω-methyl-L-arginine to generate an N-nitrosourea product. Structural characterization and mutagenesis of SznF reveal two separate active sites that promote distinct steps in this transformation using different iron-containing metallocofactors. This biosynthetic reaction, which has little precedent in enzymology or organic synthesis, expands the catalytic capabilities of non-haem-iron-dependent enzymes to include N-N bond formation. We find that biosynthetic gene clusters that encode SznF homologues are widely distributed among bacteria-including environmental organisms, plant symbionts and human pathogens-which suggests an unexpectedly diverse and uncharacterized microbial reservoir of bioactive N-nitroso metabolites.	1
Title: The primary binding subunit of the human interleukin-4 receptor is also a component of the interleukin-13 receptor Abstract: Interleukin (IL)-13 elicits a subset of the biological activities of the related IL-4. The basis of this functional similarity is that their specific cell-surface receptors (called IL-13R and IL-4R) are distinct, yet are complex and share a common subunit(s). The IL-4R primary binding subunit (called IL-4R alpha) does not by itself bind IL-13. We show that the ability of IL-13 to partially compete for IL-4 binding to some human cell types depended on co-expression of IL-4R and IL-13R. However, IL-13 binding was always associated with IL-4 binding. Hyper-expression of IL-4R alpha on cells expressing both IL-4R and IL-13R decreased their binding affinity for IL-4, abrogated the ability of IL-13 to compete for IL-4 binding, and yet had no effect on IL-13R properties. Anti-human IL-4R alpha monoclonal antibodies which blocked the biological function and binding of IL-4 also blocked the function and binding of IL-13. These data show that IL-4R alpha is a secondary component of IL-13R.	0
Title: High-Throughput, Label-Free Isolation of Cancer Stem Cells on the Basis of Cell Adhesion Capacity Abstract: Herein we report a microfluidics method that enriches cancer stem cells (CSCs) or tumor-initiating cells on the basis of cell adhesion properties. In our on-chip enrichment system, cancer cells were driven by hydrodynamic forces to flow through microchannels coated with basement membrane extract. Highly adhesive cells were captured by the functionalized microchannels, and less adhesive cells were collected from the outlets. Two heterogeneous breast cancer cell lines (SUM-149 and SUM-159) were successfully separated into enriched subpopulations according to their adhesive capacity, and the enrichment of the cancer stem cells was confirmed by flow cytometry biomarker analysis and tumor-formation assays. Our findings show that the less adhesive phenotype is associated with a higher percentage of CSCs, higher cancer-cell motility, and higher resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs.	0
Title: Identification and characterization of Shiga toxin type 2 variants in Escherichia coli isolates from animals, food, and humans Abstract: There is considerable heterogeneity among the Shiga toxin type 2 (Stx2) toxins elaborated by Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC). One such Stx2 variant, the Stx2d mucus-activatable toxin (Stx2dact), is rendered more toxic by the action of elastase present in intestinal mucus, which cleaves the last two amino acids of the A2 portion of the toxin A subunit. We screened 153 STEC isolates from food, animals, and humans for the gene encoding Stx2dact by using a novel one-step PCR procedure. This method targeted the region of stx(2dact) that encodes the elastase recognition site. The presence of stx(2dact) was confirmed by DNA sequencing of the complete toxin genes. Seven STEC isolates from cows (four isolates), meat (two isolates), and a human (one isolate) that carried the putative stx(2dact) gene were identified; all were eae negative, and none was the O157:H7 serotype. Three of the isolates (CVM9322, CVM9557, and CVM9584) also carried stx(1), two (P1332 and P1334) carried stx(1) and stx(2c), and one (CL-15) carried stx(2c). One isolate, P1130, harbored only stx(2dact). The Vero cell cytotoxicities of supernatants from P1130 and stx(1) deletion mutants of CVM9322, CVM9557, and CVM9584 were increased 13- to 30-fold after treatment with porcine elastase. Thus, Stx2dact-producing strains, as detected by our one-step PCR method, can be isolated not only from humans, as previously documented, but also from food and animals. The latter finding has important public health implications based on a recent report from Europe of a link between disease severity and infection with STEC isolates that produce Stx2dact.	0
Title: Fungal Isocyanide Synthases and Xanthocillin Biosynthesis in Aspergillus fumigatus Abstract: Microbial secondary metabolites, including isocyanide moieties, have been extensively mined for their repertoire of bioactive properties. Although the first naturally occurring isocyanide (xanthocillin) was isolated from the fungus Penicillium notatum over half a century ago, the biosynthetic origins of fungal isocyanides remain unknown. Here we report the identification of a family of isocyanide synthases (ICSs) from the opportunistic human pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus Comparative metabolomics of overexpression or knockout mutants of ICS candidate genes led to the discovery of a fungal biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) that produces xanthocillin (xan). Detailed analysis of xanthocillin biosynthesis in A. fumigatus revealed several previously undescribed compounds produced by the xan BGC, including two novel members of the melanocin family of compounds. We found both the xan BGC and a second ICS-containing cluster, named the copper-responsive metabolite (crm) BGC, to be transcriptionally responsive to external copper levels and further demonstrated that production of metabolites from the xan BGC is increased during copper starvation. The crm BGC includes a novel type of fungus-specific ICS-nonribosomal peptide synthase (NRPS) hybrid enzyme, CrmA. This family of ICS-NRPS hybrid enzymes is highly enriched in fungal pathogens of humans, insects, and plants. Phylogenetic assessment of all ICSs spanning the tree of life shows not only high prevalence throughout the fungal kingdom but also distribution in species not previously known to harbor BGCs, indicating an untapped resource of fungal secondary metabolism.IMPORTANCE Fungal ICSs are an untapped resource in fungal natural product research. Their isocyanide products have been implicated in plant and insect pathogenesis due to their ability to coordinate transition metals and disable host metalloenzymes. The discovery of a novel isocyanide-producing family of hybrid ICS-NRPS enzymes enriched in medically and agriculturally important fungal pathogens may reveal mechanisms underlying pathogenicity and afford opportunities to discover additional families of isocyanides. Furthermore, the identification of noncanonical ICS BGCs will enable refinement of BGC prediction algorithms to expand on the secondary metabolic potential of fungal and bacterial species. The identification of genes related to ICS BGCs in fungal species not previously known for secondary metabolite-producing capabilities (e.g., Saccharomyces spp.) contributes to our understanding of the evolution of BGC in fungi.	1
Title: Bacteriophage Tail-Tube Assembly Studied by Proton-Detected 4D Solid-State NMR Abstract: Obtaining unambiguous resonance assignments remains a major bottleneck in solid-state NMR studies of protein structure and dynamics. Particularly for supramolecular assemblies with large subunits (>150 residues), the analysis of crowded spectral data presents a challenge, even if three-dimensional (3D) spectra are used. Here, we present a proton-detected 4D solid-state NMR assignment procedure that is tailored for large assemblies. The key to recording 4D spectra with three indirect carbon or nitrogen dimensions with their inherently large chemical shift dispersion lies in the use of sparse non-uniform sampling (as low as 2 %). As a proof of principle, we acquired 4D (H)COCANH, (H)CACONH, and (H)CBCANH spectra of the 20 kDa bacteriophage tail-tube protein gp17.1 in a total time of two and a half weeks. These spectra were sufficient to obtain complete resonance assignments in a straightforward manner without use of previous solution NMR data.	0
Title: An unusual metal-bound 4-fluorothreonine transaldolase from Streptomyces sp. MA37 catalyses promiscuous transaldol reactions Abstract: β-Hydroxy-α-amino acids (βH-AAs) are key components of many bioactive molecules as well as exist as specialised metabolites. Among these βH-AAs, 4-fluorothreonine (4-FT) is the only naturally occurring fluorinated AA discovered thus far. Here we report overexpression and biochemical characterisation of 4-fluorothreonine transaldolase from Streptomyces sp. MA37 (FTaseMA), a homologue of FTase previously identified in the biosynthesis of 4-FT in S. cattleya. FTaseMA displays considerable substrate plasticity to generate 4-FT as well as other β-hydroxy-α-amino acids with various functionalities at C4 position, giving the prospect of new chemo-enzymatic applications. The enzyme has a hybrid of two catalytic domains, serine hydroxymethyltransferase (S) and aldolase (A). Site-directed mutagenesis allowed the identification of the key residues of FTases, suggesting that the active site of A domain has a historical reminiscent feature in metal-dependent aldolases. Elemental analysis demonstrated that FTaseMA is indeed a Zn2+-dependent enzyme, the first example of pyridoxal phosphate (PLP) enzyme family fused with a metal-binding domain carrying out a distinct catalytic role. Finally, FTaseMA showed divergent evolutionary origin with other PLP dependent enzymes.	0
Title: Waikikiamides A-C: Complex Diketopiperazine Dimer and Diketopiperazine-Polyketide Hybrids from a Hawaiian Marine Fungal Strain Aspergillus sp. FM242 Abstract: Waikikiamides A-C (1-3), structurally complex diketopiperazine derivatives, and putative biogenic precursors, (+)-semivioxanthin (4), notoamide F (5), and (-)-notoamide A (6), were isolated from Aspergillus sp. FM242. 1 and 2, bearing a hendecacyclic ring system, represent a novel skeleton. 3 features the first unique heterodimer of two notoamide analogs with an N-O-C bridge. Compounds 1 and 3 exhibit antiproliferative activity with IC50 values in the range of 0.56 to 1.86 μM. The gene clusters mined from the sequenced genome support their putative biosynthetic pathways.	1
Title: The filamentous fungal gene expression database (FFGED) Abstract: Filamentous fungal gene expression assays provide essential information for understanding systemic cellular regulation. To aid research on fungal gene expression, we constructed a novel, comprehensive, free database, the filamentous fungal gene expression database (FFGED), available at http://bioinfo.townsend.yale.edu. FFGED features user-friendly management of gene expression data, which are assorted into experimental metadata, experimental design, raw data, normalized details, and analysis results. Data may be submitted in the process of an experiment, and any user can submit multiple experiments, thus classifying the FFGED as an "active experiment" database. Most importantly, FFGED functions as a collective and collaborative platform, by connecting each experiment with similar related experiments made public by other users, maximizing data sharing among different users, and correlating diverse gene expression levels under multiple experimental designs within different experiments. A clear and efficient web interface is provided with enhancement by AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) and through a collection of tools to effectively facilitate data submission, sharing, retrieval and visualization.	0
Title: Cross-disciplinary approaches to assist with nucleic acid testing for SARS-CoV-2 Abstract: Improving the capacity of detecting positive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 is critical for identifying the infection of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) precisely and thereby curbing the pandemic. Cross-disciplinary approaches may improve the efficiency of COVID-19 diagnosis by compensating to some extent the limitations encountered by traditional test methods during the COVID-19 pandemic. Combining computed tomography (CT), serum-specific antibody detection, and nanopore sequencing with nucleic acid testing for individual testing may improve the accuracy of identifying COVID-19 patients. At community or even regional/national levels, the combination of pooled screening and spatial epidemiological strategies may enable the detection of early transmission of epidemics in a cost-effective way, which is also less affected by restricted access to diagnostic tests and kit supplies. This would significantly advance our capacity of curbing epidemics as soon as possible, and better prepare us for entering a new era of high-impact and high-frequency epidemics.	0
Title: Non-canonical Bromodomain within DNA-PKcs Promotes DNA Damage Response and Radioresistance through Recognizing an IR-Induced Acetyl-Lysine on H2AX Abstract: Regulatory mechanisms underlying γH2AX induction and the associated cell fate decision during DNA damage response (DDR) remain obscure. Here, we discover a bromodomain (BRD)-like module in DNA-PKcs (DNA-PKcs-BRD) that specifically recognizes H2AX acetyl-lysine 5 (K5ac) for sequential induction of γH2AX and concurrent cell fate decision(s). First, top-down mass spectrometry of radiation-phenotypic, full-length H2AX revealed a radiation-inducible, K5ac-dependent induction of γH2AX. Combined approaches of sequence-structure modeling/docking, site-directed mutagenesis, and biochemical experiments illustrated that through docking on H2AX K5ac, this non-canonical BRD determines not only the H2AX-targeting activity of DNA-PKcs but also the over-activation of DNA-PKcs in radioresistant tumor cells, whereas a Kac antagonist, JQ1, was able to bind to DNA-PKcs-BRD, leading to re-sensitization of tumor cells to radiation. This study elucidates the mechanism underlying the H2AX-dependent regulation of DNA-PKcs in ionizing radiation-induced, differential DDR, and derives an unconventional, non-catalytic domain target in DNA-PKs for overcoming resistance during cancer radiotherapy.	0
Title: Prediction of RNA binding proteins comes of age from low resolution to high resolution Abstract: Networks of protein-RNA interactions is likely to be larger than protein-protein and protein-DNA interaction networks because RNA transcripts are encoded tens of times more than proteins (e.g. only 3% of human genome coded for proteins), have diverse function and localization, and are controlled by proteins from birth (transcription) to death (degradation). This massive network is evidenced by several recent experimental discoveries of large numbers of previously unknown RNA-binding proteins (RBPs). Meanwhile, more than 400 non-redundant protein-RNA complex structures (at 25% sequence identity or less) have been deposited into the protein databank. These sequences and structural resources for RBPs provide ample data for the development of computational techniques dedicated to RBP prediction, as experimentally determining RNA-binding functions is time-consuming and expensive. This review compares traditional machine-learning based approaches with emerging template-based methods at several levels of prediction resolution ranging from two-state binding/non-binding prediction, to binding residue prediction and protein-RNA complex structure prediction. The analysis indicates that the two approaches are complementary and their combinations may lead to further improvements.	0
Title: Early steps in carotenoid biosynthesis: sequences and transcriptional analysis of the crtI and crtB genes of Rhodobacter sphaeroides and overexpression and reactivation of crtI in Escherichia coli and R. sphaeroides Abstract: In the purple photosynthetic bacterium Rhodobacter sphaeroides, the desaturation of phytoene has already been implicated in the assembly of the light-harvesting 2 complex (H.P. Lang and C.N. Hunter, Biochem. J. 298:197-205, 1994). The phytoene synthase and desaturase enzymes mediate the first steps specific for carotenoid biosynthesis up to and including the synthesis of the colored carotenoid neurosporene. In this report, we present the DNA and deduced amino acid sequences of the genes encoding these proteins, namely, crtB and crtI, from R. sphaeroides and present evidence for the existence of a crtIB operon. Both genes have been shown to possess putative puc and puf operon-like promoter sequences, and oxygen regulation and the point of initiation of the crtI transcript have been demonstrated. The complete crtI gene has been overexpressed in Escherichia coli and R. sphaeroides and shown to catalyze three desaturations of phytoene to give neurosporene. This activity was shown to be ATP dependent, and the cofactor requirement was investigated by using a spectroscopic assay for in vitro carotenogenic activity. Although the crtI and crtB genes have been sequenced from a number of different organisms, the transcriptional organization and regulation of these genes have not been analyzed in detail. In this report, we have located the transcription initiation point and have shown that R. sphaeroides possesses an oxygen-regulated CrtI-type phytoene desaturase gene that forms a transcriptional operon with crtB.	1
Title: The relationship between visible intracellular aggregates that appear after overexpression of Sup35 and the yeast prion-like elements [PSI(+)] and [PIN(+)] Abstract: Overproduced fusions of Sup35 or its prion domain with green fluorescent protein (GFP) have previously been shown to form frequent dots in [PSI(+)] cells. Rare foci seen in [psi(-)] cells were hypothesized to indicate the de novo induction of [PSI(+)] caused by the overproduced prion domain. Here, we describe novel ring-type aggregates that also appear in [psi(-)] cultures upon Sup35 overproduction and show directly that dot and ring aggregates only appear in cells that have become [PSI(+)]. The formation of either type of aggregate requires [PIN(+)], an element needed for the induction of [PSI(+)]. Although aggregates are visible predominantly in stationary-phase cultures, [PSI(+)] induction starts in exponential phase, suggesting that much smaller aggregates can also propagate [PSI(+)]. Such small aggregates are probably present in [PSI(+)] cells and, upon Sup35-GFP overproduction, facilitate the frequent formation of dot aggregates, but only the occasional appearance of ring aggregates. In contrast, rings are very frequent when [PSI(+)] cultures, including those lacking [PIN(+)], are grown in the presence of GuHCl or excess Hsp104 while overexpressing Sup35-GFP. Thus, intermediates formed during [PSI(+)] curing seem to facilitate ring formation. Surprisingly, GuHCl and excess Hsp104, which are known to promote loss of [PSI(+)], did not prevent the de novo induction of [PSI(+)] by excess Sup35 in [psi(-)][PIN(+)] strains.	0
Title: Phenolic lipids synthesized by type III polyketide synthase confer penicillin resistance on Streptomyces griseus Abstract: Type III polyketide synthases (PKSs) found in plants, fungi, and bacteria synthesize a variety of aromatic polyketides. A Gram-positive, filamentous bacterium Streptomyces griseus contained an srs operon, in which srsA encoded a type III PKS, srsB encoded a methyltransferase, and srsC encoded a flavoprotein hydroxylase. Consistent with this annotation, overexpression of the srs genes in a heterologous host, Streptomyces lividans, showed that SrsA was a type III PKS responsible for synthesis of phenolic lipids, alkylresorcinols, and alkylpyrones, SrsB was a methyltransferase acting on the phenolic lipids to yield alkylresorcinol methyl ethers, and SrsC was a hydroxylase acting on the alkylresorcinol methyl ethers. In vitro SrsA reaction showed that SrsA synthesized alkylresorcinols from acyl-CoAs of various chain lengths as a starter substrate, one molecule of methylmalonyl-CoA, and two molecules of malonyl-CoA. SrsA was thus unique in that it incorporated the extender substrates in a strictly controlled order of malonyl-CoA, malonyl-CoA, and methylmalonyl-CoA to produce alkylresorcinols. An srsA mutant, which produced no phenolic lipids, was highly sensitive to beta-lactam antibiotics, such as penicillin G and cephalexin. Together with the fact that the alkylresorcinols were fractionated mainly in the cell wall fraction, this observation suggests that the phenolic lipids, perhaps associated with the cytoplasmic membrane because of their amphiphilic property, affect the characteristic and rigidity of the cytoplasmic membrane/peptidoglycan of a variety of bacteria. An srs-like operon is found widely among Gram-positive and -negative bacteria, indicating wide distribution of the phenolic lipids.	1
Title: Organisation and functions of the actVA region of the actinorhodin biosynthetic gene cluster of Streptomyces coelicolor Abstract: Sequence analysis of the actVA region of the actinorhodin biosynthetic gene cluster of Streptomyces coelicolor revealed a succession of six open reading frames (ORFs), all running in the same direction and extending over 5.32 kb. The protein product of actVA-ORF1 strongly resembles that of another gene, elsewhere in the act cluster (actII-ORF2), which codes for a trans-membrane protein previously implicated in actinorhodin export from the mycelium. This suggests that the two gene products may co-operate in actinorhodin export, perhaps being sufficient for self-protection of the organism against suicide. At least four of the other five ORFs are implicated in the control of the C-6 and C-8 ring-hydroxylation reactions, lacking in actVA mutants, that occur at middle to late stages in the actinorhodin biosynthetic pathway. This conclusion was reached by genetic mapping of actVA mutants to actVA-ORF3 and -ORF5 (and perhaps -ORF4), and by the finding of strong resemblances between the protein products of actVA-ORF2 and -ORF6 and the products of genes of the oxytetracycline or tetracenomycin gene clusters that have been implicated in ring-hydroxylation reactions in the biosynthesis of these other aromatic polyketide antibiotics.	1
Title: Intracellular light-activation of riboswitch activity Abstract: By combining a riboswitch with a cell-permeable photocaged small-molecule ligand, an optochemical gene control element was constructed that enabled spatial and temporal control of gene expression in bacterial cells. The simplicity of this strategy, coupled with the ability to create synthetic riboswitches with tailored ligand specificities and output in a variety of microorganisms, plants, and fungi might afford a general strategy to photocontrol gene expression in vivo. The ability to activate riboswitches by using light enables the interrogation and manipulation of a wide range of biological processes with high precision, and will have broad utility in the regulation of artificial genetic circuits.	0
Title: A structure-guided approach to creating covalent FGFR inhibitors Abstract: The fibroblast growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases (FGFR1, 2, 3, and 4) represent promising therapeutic targets in a number of cancers. We have developed the first potent and selective irreversible inhibitor of FGFR1, 2, 3, and 4, which we named FIIN-1 that forms a covalent bond with cysteine 486 located in the P loop of the FGFR1 ATP binding site. We demonstrated that the inhibitor potently inhibits Tel-FGFR1-transformed Ba/F3 cells (EC(50) = 14 nM) as well as numerous FGFR-dependent cancer cell lines. A biotin-derivatized version of the inhibitor, FIIN-1-biotin, was shown to covalently label FGFR1 at Cys486. FIIN-1 is a useful probe of FGFR-dependent cellular phenomena and may provide a starting point of the development of therapeutically relevant irreversible inhibitors of wild-type and drug-resistant forms of FGFR kinases.	0
Title: Methanogenesis in a Thermophilic (58 degrees C) Anaerobic Digestor: Methanothrix sp. as an Important Aceticlastic Methanogen Abstract: Aceticlastic methanogens and other microbial groups were enumerated in a 58 degrees C laboratory-scale (3 liter) anaerobic digestor which was fed air-classified municipal refuse, a lignocellulosic waste (loading rate = 1.8 to 2.7 g of volatile solids per liter per day; retention time = 10 days). Two weeks after start-up, Methanosarcina sp. was present in high numbers (10 to 10 CFU/ml) and autofluorescent Methanosarcina-like clumps were abundant in sludge examined by using epifluorescence microscopy. After about 4 months of digestor operation, numbers of Methanosarcina sp. dropped 2 to 3 orders of magnitude and large numbers (most probable number = 10 to 10/ml) of a thermophilic aceticlastic methanogen morphologically resembing Methanothrix sp. were found. Methanothrix sp. had apparently displaced Methanosarcina sp. as the dominant aceticlastic methanogen in the digestor. During the period when Methanothrix sp. was apparently dominant, acetate concentrations varied between 0.3 and 1.5 mumol/ml during the daily feeding cycle, and acetate was the precursor of 63 to 66% of the methane produced during peak digestor methanogenesis. The apparent K(m) value obtained for methanogenesis from acetate, 0.3 mumol/ml, indicated that the aceticlastic methanogens were nearly saturated for substrate during most of the digestor cycle. CO(2)-reducing methanogens were capable of methanogenesis at rates more than 12 times greater than those usually found in the digestor. Added propionate (4.5 mumol/ml) was metabolized slowly by the digestor populations and slightly inhibited methanogenesis. Added n-butyrate, isobutyrate, or n-valerate (4.5 mumol/ml each) were broken down within 24 h. Isobutyrate was oxidized to acetate, a novel reaction possibly involving isomerization to n-butyrate. The rapid growth rate and versatile metabolism of Methanosarcina sp. make it a likely organism to be involved in start-up, whereas the low K(m) value of Methanothrix sp. for acetate may cause it to be favored in stable digestors operated with long retention times.	0
Title: The developmentally regulated Aspergillus nidulans wA gene encodes a polypeptide homologous to polyketide and fatty acid synthases Abstract: The Aspergillus nidulans wA gene is required for synthesis of a green pigment present in the walls of mature asexual spores (conidia); wA mutants produce colorless (white) conidia. We determined the transcriptional structure and DNA sequence of the wA gene. wA consists of 5 exons separated by short (40-60 bp) introns. The processed transcript has the potential to encode a protein consisting of 1986 amino acid residues. The predicted WA polypeptide showed extensive sequence similarities with bacterial and fungal polyketide synthases and vertebrate fatty acid synthases, particularly within conserved active sites. Properties of the yellow conidial wall pigment intermediate suggest that it is a polyketide rather than a fatty acid. It is therefore likely that wA encodes all or part of a polyketide synthase involved in the formation of this pigment intermediate.	1
Title: GLUE that sticks to HIV: a helix-grafted GLUE protein that selectively binds the HIV gp41 N-terminal helical region Abstract: Methods for the stabilization of well-defined helical peptide drugs and basic research tools have received considerable attention in the last decade. Here, we report the stable and functional display of an HIV gp41 C-peptide helix mimic on a GRAM-Like Ubiquitin-binding in EAP45 (GLUE) protein. C-peptide helix-grafted GLUE selectively binds a mimic of the N-terminal helical region of gp41, a well-established HIV drug target, in a complex cellular environment. Additionally, the helix-grafted GLUE is folded in solution, stable in human serum, and soluble in aqueous solutions, and thus overcomes challenges faced by a multitude of peptide drugs, including those derived from HIV gp41 C-peptide.	0
Title: Astaxanthin Complexes to Attenuate Muscle Damage after In Vivo Femoral Ischemia-Reperfusion Abstract: (1) Background: Reperfusion injury refers to the cell and tissue damage induced, when blood flow is restored after an ischemic period. While reperfusion reestablishes oxygen supply, it generates a high concentration of radicals, resulting in tissue dysfunction and damage. Here, we aimed to challenge and achieve the potential of a delivery system based on astaxanthin, a natural antioxidant, in attenuating the muscle damage in an animal model of femoral hind-limb ischemia and reperfusion. (2) Methods: The antioxidant capacity and non-toxicity of astaxanthin was validated before and after loading into a polysaccharide scaffold. The capacity of astaxanthin to compensate stress damages was also studied after ischemia induced by femoral artery clamping and followed by varied periods of reperfusion. (3) Results: Histological evaluation showed a positive labeling for CD68 and CD163 macrophage markers, indicating a remodeling process. In addition, higher levels of Nrf2 and NQO1 expression in the sham group compared to the antioxidant group could reflect a reduction of the oxidative damage after 15 days of reperfusion. Furthermore, non-significant differences were observed in non-heme iron deposition in both groups, reflecting a cell population susceptible to free radical damage. (4) Conclusions: Our results suggest that the in situ release of an antioxidant molecule could be effective in improving the antioxidant defenses of ischemia/reperfusion (I/R)-damaged muscles.	0
Title: Extensive post-translational modification, including serine to D-alanine conversion, in the two-component lantibiotic, lacticin 3147 Abstract: Lacticin 3147 is a two-component bacteriocin produced by Lactococcus lactis subspecies lactis DPC3147. In order to further characterize the biochemical nature of the bacteriocin, both peptides were isolated which together are responsible for the antimicrobial activity. The first, LtnA1, is a 3,322 Da 30-amino acid peptide and the second component, LtnA2, is a 29-amino acid peptide with a mass of 2,847 Da. Conventional amino acid analysis revealed that both peptides contain the thioether amino acid, lanthionine, as well as an excess of alanine to that predicted from the genetic sequence of the peptides. Chiral phase gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry of amino acid composition indicated that both LtnA1 and LtnA2 contain D-alanine residues and amino acid sequence analysis of LtnA1 confirmed that the D-alanine results from post-translational modification of a serine residue in the primary translation product. Taken together, these results demonstrate that lacticin 3147 is a novel, two-component, D-alanine containing lantibiotic that undergoes extensive post-translational modification which may account for its potent antimicrobial activity against a wide range of Gram-positive bacteria.	1
Title: Structure and biosynthesis of fimsbactins A-F, siderophores from Acinetobacter baumannii and Acinetobacter baylyi Abstract: Novel chatechol/hydroxamate siderophores (named "fimsbactins") were identified in Acinetobacter baumannii ATCC 17978 and Acinetobacter baylyi ADP1. The major compound, fimsbactin A, was isolated from low-iron cultures of A. baylyi ADP1, and its chemical structure was elucidated by mass spectrometry, and detailed (1)H, (13)C and (15)N NMR spectroscopy. From inverse feeding experiments following HPLC-MS analysis, the structures of five additional derivatives were elucidated. The gene cluster encoding the fimsbactin synthetase (fbs) was identified in both genomes, and mutants in fbs genes in A. baylyi were analyzed, thus allowing prediction of the fimsbactin biosynthesis pathway.	1
Title: Optogenetic control of kinetochore function Abstract: Kinetochores act as hubs for multiple activities during cell division, including microtubule interactions and spindle checkpoint signaling. Each kinetochore can act autonomously, and activities change rapidly as proteins are recruited to, or removed from, kinetochores. Understanding this dynamic system requires tools that can manipulate kinetochores on biologically relevant temporal and spatial scales. Optogenetic approaches have the potential to provide temporal and spatial control with molecular specificity. Here we report new chemical inducers of protein dimerization that allow us to both recruit proteins to and release them from kinetochores using light. We use these dimerizers to manipulate checkpoint signaling and molecular motor activity. Our findings demonstrate specialized properties of the CENP-E (kinesin-7) motor for directional chromosome transport to the spindle equator and for maintenance of metaphase alignment. This work establishes a foundation for optogenetic control of kinetochore function, which is broadly applicable to experimental probing of other dynamic cellular processes.	0
Title: Discovering chemical modifiers of oncogene-regulated hematopoietic differentiation Abstract: It has been proposed that inhibitors of an oncogene's effects on multipotent hematopoietic progenitor cell differentiation may change the properties of the leukemic stem cells and complement the clinical use of cytotoxic drugs. Using zebrafish, we developed a robust in vivo hematopoietic differentiation assay that reflects the activity of the oncogene AML1-ETO. Screening for modifiers of AML1-ETO-mediated hematopoietic dysregulation uncovered unexpected roles of COX-2- and beta-catenin-dependent pathways in AML1-ETO function. This approach may open doors for developing therapeutics targeting oncogene function within leukemic stem cells.	0
Title: Long-Lived, Non-Geminate, Radiative Recombination of Photogenerated Charges in a Polymer/Small-Molecule Acceptor Photovoltaic Blend Abstract: Minimization of open-circuit-voltage ( VOC) loss is required to transcend the efficiency limitations on the performance of organic photovoltaics (OPV). We study charge recombination in an OPV blend comprising a polymer donor with a small molecule nonfullerene acceptor that exhibits both high photovoltaic internal quantum efficiency and relatively high external electroluminescence quantum efficiency. Notably, this donor/acceptor blend, consisting of the donor polymer commonly referred to as PCE10 with a pseudoplanar small molecule acceptor (referred to as FIDTT-2PDI) exhibits relatively bright delayed photoluminescence on the microsecond time scale beyond that observed in the neat material. We study the photoluminescence decay kinetics of the blend in detail and conclude that this long-lived photoluminescence arises from radiative nongeminate recombination of charge carriers, which we propose occurs via a donor/acceptor CT state located close in energy to the singlet state of the polymer donor. Additionally, crystallographic and spectroscopic studies point toward low subgap disorder, which could be beneficial for low radiative and nonradiative losses. These results provide an important demonstration of photoluminescence due to nongeminate charge recombination in an efficient OPV blend, a key step in identifying new OPV materials and materials-screening criteria if OPV is to approach the theoretical limits to efficiency.	0
Title: Purification and characterization of phosphonoglycans from Glycomyces sp. strain NRRL B-16210 and Stackebrandtia nassauensis NRRL B-16338 Abstract: Two related actinomycetes, Glycomyces sp. strain NRRL B-16210 and Stackebrandtia nassauensis NRRL B-16338, were identified as potential phosphonic acid producers by screening for the gene encoding phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) mutase, which is required for the biosynthesis of most phosphonates. Using a variety of analytical techniques, both strains were subsequently shown to produce phosphonate-containing exopolysaccharides (EPS), also known as phosphonoglycans. The phosphonoglycans were purified by sequential organic solvent extractions, methanol precipitation, and ultrafiltration. The EPS from the Glycomyces strain has a mass of 40 to 50 kDa and is composed of galactose, xylose, and five distinct partially O-methylated galactose residues. Per-deutero-methylation analysis indicated that galactosyl residues in the polysaccharide backbone are 3,4-linked Gal, 2,4-linked 3-MeGal, 2,3-linked Gal, 3,6-linked 2-MeGal, and 4,6-linked 2,3-diMeGal. The EPS from the Stackebrandtia strain is comprised of glucose, galactose, xylose, and four partially O-methylated galactose residues. Isotopic labeling indicated that the O-methyl groups in the Stackebrandtia phosphonoglycan arise from S-adenosylmethionine. The phosphonate moiety in both phosphonoglycans was shown to be 2-hydroxyethylphosphonate (2-HEP) by (31)P nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and mass spectrometry following strong acid hydrolysis of the purified molecules. Partial acid hydrolysis of the purified EPS from Glycomyces yielded 2-HEP in ester linkage to the O-5 or O-6 position of a hexose and a 2-HEP mono(2,3-dihydroxypropyl)ester. Partial acid hydrolysis of Stackebrandtia EPS also revealed the presence of 2-HEP mono(2,3-dihydroxypropyl)ester. Examination of the genome sequences of the two strains revealed similar pepM-containing gene clusters that are likely to be required for phosphonoglycan synthesis.	1
Title: The Biosynthetic Gene Cluster for Andrastin A in Penicillium roqueforti Abstract: Penicillium roqueforti is a filamentous fungus involved in the ripening of several kinds of blue cheeses. In addition, this fungus produces several secondary metabolites, including the meroterpenoid compound andrastin A, a promising antitumoral compound. However, to date the genomic cluster responsible for the biosynthesis of this compound in P. roqueforti has not been described. In this work, we have sequenced and annotated a genomic region of approximately 29.4 kbp (named the adr gene cluster) that is involved in the biosynthesis of andrastin A in P. roqueforti. This region contains ten genes, named adrA, adrC, adrD, adrE, adrF, adrG, adrH, adrI, adrJ and adrK. Interestingly, the adrB gene previously found in the adr cluster from P. chrysogenum, was found as a residual pseudogene in the adr cluster from P. roqueforti. RNA-mediated gene silencing of each of the ten genes resulted in significant reductions in andrastin A production, confirming that all of them are involved in the biosynthesis of this compound. Of particular interest was the adrC gene, encoding for a major facilitator superfamily transporter. According to our results, this gene is required for the production of andrastin A but does not have any role in its secretion to the extracellular medium. The identification of the adr cluster in P. roqueforti will be important to understand the molecular basis of the production of andrastin A, and for the obtainment of strains of P. roqueforti overproducing andrastin A that might be of interest for the cheese industry.	1
Title: Identification and characterization of the biosynthetic gene cluster of thiolutin, a tumor angiogenesis inhibitor, in Saccharothrix algeriensis NRRL B-24137 Abstract: In this study, a new dithiolopyrrolone biosynthetic pathway was identified in Saccharothrix algeriensis NRRL B-24137, which was reported to produce a variety of dithiolopyrrolone natural products including thiolutin, a potential drug candidate for tumor angiogenesis inhibition. Bioinformatics analysis of the cluster revealed that it contains all the essential genes for holothin core biosynthesis and several other auxiliary genes. Interestingly, heterologous expression of the gene cluster in Streptomyces albus only induced the production of holomycin, implying that the gene responsible for the N4-methylation and the gene(s) involved in the formation of various acylated chains on N7 position of the holothin may locate outside the gene cluster. Incubation of holomycin with S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) in the cell-free extract of Sa. algeriensis resulted in the production of thiolutin, suggesting that the N4-methyl group of thiolutin is originated from SAM, and the N4-methylation could be in the late stage of biosynthesis of thiolutin type dithiolopyrrolones. An evolution-based model for biosynthesis of thiolutin and its analogs was further proposed based on these results.	1
Title: Nucleotide sequence of the beta-lactamase gene from Enterococcus faecalis HH22 and its similarity to staphylococcal beta-lactamase genes Abstract: The nucleotide sequence of the constitutively produced beta-lactamase (Bla) gene from Enterococcus faecalis HH22 was shown to be identical to the published sequences of three of four staphylococcal type A beta-lactamase genes; more differences were seen with the genes for staphylococcal type C and D enzymes. One hundred forty nucleotides upstream of the beta-lactamase start codon were determined for an inducible staphylococcal beta-lactamase and were identical to those of the constitutively expressed enterococcal gene, indicating that the changes resulting in constitutive expression are not due to changes in the promoter or operator region. Moreover, complementation studies indicated that production of the enterococcal enzyme could be repressed. The genes for the enterococcal Bla and an inducible staphylococcal Bla were each cloned into a shuttle vector and transformed into enterococcal and staphylococcal recipients. The major difference between the backgrounds of the two hosts was that more enzyme was produced by the staphylococcal host, regardless of the source of the gene. The location of the enzyme was found to be host dependent, since each cloned gene generated extracellular (free) enzyme in the staphylococcus and cell-bound enzyme in the enterococcus. On the basis of the identities of the enterococcal Bla and several staphylococcal Bla sequences, these data suggest the recent spread of beta-lactamase to enterococci and also suggest the loss of a functional repressor.	0
Title: A mutation in P23, the first gene in the RNA polymerase sigma A (sigma 43) operon, affects sporulation in Bacillus subtilis Abstract: Mutations within P23, the first gene of the Bacillus subtilis sigma A operon, were not detrimental to vegetative growth or sporulation. One deletion of P23 resulted in a strain that sporulated earlier than the wild type. This aberrant phenotype may be due to the simultaneous deletion of a sigma H promoter from the sigma A operon.	0
Title: Kirromycin, an inhibitor of protein biosynthesis that acts on elongation factor Tu Abstract: Kirromycin, a new inhibitor of protein synthesis, is shown to interfere with the peptide transfer reaction by acting on elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu). All the reactions associated with this elongation factor are affected. Formation of the EF-Tu.GTP complex is strongly stimulated. Peptide bond formation is prevented only when Phe-tRNA(Phe) is bound enzymatically to ribosomes, presumably because GTP hydrolysis associated with enzymatic binding of Phe-tRNA(Phe) is not followed by release of EF-Tu.GDP from the ribosome. This antibiotic also enables EF-Tu to catalyze the binding of Phe-tRNA(Phe) to the poly(U).ribosome complex even in the absence of GTP. EF-Tu activity in the GTPase reaction is dramatically affected by kirromycin: GTP hydrolysis, which normally requires ribosomes and aminoacyl-tRNA, takes place with the elongation factor alone. This GTPase shows the same K(m) for GTP as the one dependent on Phe-tRNA(Phe) and ribosomes in the absence of the antibiotic. Ribosomes and Phe-tRNA(Phe), but not tRNA(Phe) or Ac-Phe-tRNA(Phe), stimulate the kirromycin-induced EF-Tu GTPase. These results indicate that the catalytic center of EF-Tu GTPase that is dependent upon aminoacyl-tRNA and ribosomes is primarily located on the elongation factor. In conclusion, kirromycin can substitute for GTP, aminoacyl-tRNA, or ribosomes in various reactions involving EF-Tu, apparently by affecting the allosteric controls between the sites on the EF-Tu molecule interacting with these components.	1
Title: Transforming RNA-Seq data to improve the performance of prognostic gene signatures Abstract: Gene expression measurements have successfully been used for building prognostic signatures, i.e for identifying a short list of important genes that can predict patient outcome. Mostly microarray measurements have been considered, and there is little advice available for building multivariable risk prediction models from RNA-Seq data. We specifically consider penalized regression techniques, such as the lasso and componentwise boosting, which can simultaneously consider all measurements and provide both, multivariable regression models for prediction and automated variable selection. However, they might be affected by the typical skewness, mean-variance-dependency or extreme values of RNA-Seq covariates and therefore could benefit from transformations of the latter. In an analytical part, we highlight preferential selection of covariates with large variances, which is problematic due to the mean-variance dependency of RNA-Seq data. In a simulation study, we compare different transformations of RNA-Seq data for potentially improving detection of important genes. Specifically, we consider standardization, the log transformation, a variance-stabilizing transformation, the Box-Cox transformation, and rank-based transformations. In addition, the prediction performance for real data from patients with kidney cancer and acute myeloid leukemia is considered. We show that signature size, identification performance, and prediction performance critically depend on the choice of a suitable transformation. Rank-based transformations perform well in all scenarios and can even outperform complex variance-stabilizing approaches. Generally, the results illustrate that the distribution and potential transformations of RNA-Seq data need to be considered as a critical step when building risk prediction models by penalized regression techniques.	0
Title: Butyrolactone synthesis via polar radical crossover cycloaddition reactions: diastereoselective syntheses of methylenolactocin and protolichesterinic acid Abstract: A direct catalytic synthesis of γ-butyrolactones from simple alkene and unsaturated acid starting materials is reported. The catalytic system consists of the Fukuzumi acridinium photooxidant and substoichiometric quantities of a redox-active cocatalyst. Oxidizable alkenes such as styrenes and trisubstituted aliphatic alkenes are cyclized with unsaturated acids via polar radical crossover cycloaddition (PRCC) reactions. This method has been applied to the diastereoselective total synthesis of methylenolactocin and protolichesterinic acid.	0
Title: Uberolysin: a novel cyclic bacteriocin produced by Streptococcus uberis Abstract: Streptococcus uberis is commonly found in the environment and in association with various bovine body sites and is a major cause of bovine mastitis. Moreover, S. uberis is known to produce a variety of bacteriocin-like inhibitory substances, antimicrobial agents that generally inhibit closely related bacterial species. In this respect, S. uberis strain 42 has previously been shown to produce a novel nisin variant named nisin U. This paper reports that, in addition to nisin U, S. uberis strain 42 produces a second bacteriocin that induces the lysis of metabolically active, susceptible target bacteria and which has therefore been named uberolysin. Isolation of the native active antimicrobial agent revealed that uberolysin is a 7048 Da peptide that is refractory to sequence analysis by Edman degradation. Transposon mutagenesis was used to generate a uberolysin-negative mutant of S. uberis 42 and sequencing of DNA flanking the insertion site revealed, in addition to the structural gene (ublA), several open reading frames likely to be involved in post-translational modification, transport and producer self-protection (immunity), and possibly in regulation of the biosynthetic gene cluster. In addition, a pair of direct repeats that may be involved in bacteriocin acquisition were identified; indeed, ublA could be identified in 18 % of tested S. uberis strains. Enzymic hydrolysis of uberolysin was used to confirm that ublA does indeed encode the precursor of uberolysin, that an unusually short leader sequence of only six amino acids is cleaved during processing of the mature peptide and that uberolysin is post-translationally covalently modified to form a head-to-tail monocycle. Thus, uberolysin is a unique cyclic bacteriocin, belonging to the same family of bacteriocins as enterocin AS-48 and circularin A.	1
Title: Identification of lysophospholipase protein from Spiroplasma eriocheiris and verification of its function Abstract: Spiroplasma eriocheiris is known to cause tremor disease in the Chinese mitten crab Eriocheir sinensis; however, the molecular characterization of this pathogen is still unclear. S. eriocheiris has the ability to invade and survive within mouse 3T6 cells. The invasion process may require causing damage to the host cell membrane by chemical, physical or enzymatic means. In this study, we systematically characterized a novel lysophospholipase (lysoPL) of S. eriocheiris TDA-040725-5T. The gene that encodes lysoPL in S. eriocheiris (SE-LysoPL) was cloned, sequenced and expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3). Enzymatic assays revealed that the purified recombinant SE-LysoPL hydrolysed long-chain acyl esterases at pH 7 and 30 °C. SE-LysoPL was detected in the membrane and cytoplasmic protein fractions using the SE-LysoPL antibody in Western blot. The virulence ability of S. eriocheiris was effectively reduced at the early stage of infection (m.o.i.=100) by the SE-LysoPL antibody neutralization test. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to identify and characterize a gene from S. eriocheiris encoding a protein exhibiting lysoPL and esterase activities. Our findings indicate that SE-LysoPL plays important roles in the pathogenicity of S. eriocheiris.	0
Title: Biosynthesis of 2-deoxystreptamine-containing antibiotics in Streptoalloteichus hindustanus JCM 3268: characterization of 2-deoxy-scyllo-inosose synthase Abstract: A part of the new biosynthetic gene cluster for 2-deoxystreptamine-containing antibiotics was identified from Streptoalloteichus hindustanus. The alloH gene in the gene cluster was deduced to encode 2-deoxy-scyllo-inosose synthase and the expressed protein AlloH was confirmed to have this enzyme activity. Furthermore, biochemical properties of AlloH were studied.	1
Title: Structure, Total Synthesis, and Biosynthesis of Chloromyxamides: Myxobacterial Tetrapeptides Featuring an Uncommon 6-Chloromethyl-5-methoxypipecolic Acid Building Block Abstract: Soil-living microbes are an important resource for the discovery of new natural products featuring great structural diversity that are reflective of the underlying biosynthetic pathways as well as incorporating a wide range of intriguing small-molecule building blocks. We report here the full structural elucidation, total synthesis, and biosynthesis of chloromyxamides, a new class of tetrapeptides that display an unprecedented 6-chloromethyl-5-methoxypipecolic acid (CMPA) substructure. Chemical synthesis-including an approach to access the CMPA unit-was pursued to confirm the structure of the chloromyxamides and enabled determination of the absolute configuration in the CMPA ring. A model for the nonribosomal assembly of chloromyxamides was devised on the basis of the combined evaluation of the biosynthetic gene cluster sequence and the feeding of stable isotope-labeled precursors. This provided insight into the formation of the various chloromyxamide derivatives and the biogenesis of the CMPA unit.	1
Title: A fungal ketoreductase domain that displays substrate-dependent stereospecificity Abstract: Iterative highly reducing polyketide synthases from filamentous fungi are the most complex and enigmatic type of polyketide synthase discovered to date. Here we uncover an unusual degree of programming by the hypothemycin highly reducing polyketide synthase, in which a single ketoreductase domain shows stereospecificity that is controlled by substrate length. Mapping of the structural domains responsible for this feature allowed for the biosynthesis of an unnatural diastereomer of the natural product dehydrozearalenol.	0
Title: Prenylation and membrane localization of Cdc42 are essential for activation by DOCK7 Abstract: The unconventional guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) family comprising 11 DOCK180 related proteins is classified into four subfamilies, A through D, based on their relative GEF activity toward the closely related Rac and Cdc42 GTPases. DOCK proteins participate in the remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton and are key regulators of cell motility, phagocytosis, and adhesion. Here we show that the guanine nucleotide exchange domain of DOCK7, DHR2 (for DOCK homology region 2), is a potent GEF for prenylated Cdc42 and Rac1 in a model liposome system, demonstrating that the prenylation and membrane localization of Cdc42 or Rac1 are necessary for their activation by DOCK7. Additionally, we identify DOCK7 residues that confer GTPase GEF specificity. Finally, using our liposome reconstitution assay, we show that a more narrowly defined GEF domain of DHR2 (designated DHR2s) harbors an N-terminal site distinct from the GEF active site that binds preferentially to the active, GTP-bound forms of Cdc42 and Rac1 and thereby recruits free DHR2s from solution to the membrane surface. This recruitment results in a progressive increase in the effective concentration of DHR2s at the membrane surface that in turn provides for an accelerated rate of guanine nucleotide exchange on Cdc42. The positive cooperativity observed in our reconstituted system suggests that the action of DOCK7 in vivo may involve the coordinated integration of Cdc42/Rac signaling in the context of the membrane recruitment of a DOCK7 GEF complex.	0
Title: Mutants of feline immunodeficiency virus resistant to 2',3'-dideoxy-2',3'-didehydrothymidine Abstract: We selected mutants of feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) that are resistant to 2',3'-dideoxy-2',3'-didehydrothymidine (d4T). Two mutants were selected in cultured cells with a stepwise increase in d4T concentration, resulting in mutants able to replicate in 100 microM d4T. These mutants were three- to sixfold more resistant to d4T than wild-type FIV. They were also cross-resistant to 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine (AZT), 3'-fluoro-2',3'-dideoxythymidine, 2',3'-dideoxycytidine, 2',3'-dideoxyinosine, and 9-(2-phosphonylmethoxyethyl)adenine, and they were highly resistant to phosphonoformic acid (PFA). Plaque-purified mutants were isolated from each of the mutant populations. The mutant phenotype was stable, because both of the plaque-purified mutants remained d4T resistant even after three passages in the absence of d4T. One of the plaque-purified mutants, designated D4R-3c, was further characterized. Compared with wild-type reverse transcriptase (RT), RT purified from D4R-3c was 3-fold resistant to inhibition by the 5'-triphosphate of d4T, 10-fold resistant to inhibition by the 5'-triphosphate of AZT, and 6-fold resistant to PFA. D4R-3c had a single point mutation in the RT-encoding region of the pol gene at position 2474, resulting in a Val to Ile mutation at codon 47 of the FIV RT. The role of this mutation in d4T resistance was confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis.	0
Title: Alanylclavam biosynthetic genes are clustered together with one group of clavulanic acid biosynthetic genes in Streptomyces clavuligerus Abstract: Streptomyces clavuligerus produces at least five different clavam metabolites, including clavulanic acid and the methionine antimetabolite, alanylclavam. In vitro transposon mutagenesis was used to analyze a 13-kb region upstream of the known paralogue gene cluster. The paralogue cluster includes one group of clavulanic acid biosynthetic genes in S. clavuligerus. Twelve open reading frames (ORFs) were found in this area, and mutants were generated in each using either in vitro transposon or PCR-targeted mutagenesis. Mutants with defects in any of the genes orfA, orfB, orfC, or orfD were unable to produce alanylclavam but could produce all of the other clavams, including clavulanic acid. orfA encodes a predicted hydroxymethyltransferase, orfB encodes a YjgF/YER057c/UK114-family regulatory protein, orfC encodes an aminotransferase, and orfD encodes a dehydratase. All of these types of proteins are normally involved in amino acid metabolism. Mutants in orfC or orfD also accumulated a novel clavam metabolite instead of alanylclavam, and a complemented orfC mutant was able to produce trace amounts of alanylclavam while still producing the novel clavam. Mass spectrometric analyses, together with consideration of the enzymes involved in its production, led to tentative identification of the novel clavam as 8-OH-alanylclavam, an intermediate in the proposed alanylclavam biosynthetic pathway.	1
Title: Evernimicin binds exclusively to the 50S ribosomal subunit and inhibits translation in cell-free systems derived from both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria Abstract: Evernimicin (SCH 27899) is a new antibiotic with activity against a wide spectrum of gram-positive bacteria and activity against some gram-negative bacteria. Previous metabolic labeling studies indicated that evernimicin specifically inhibited protein synthesis in Staphylococcus aureus. Using a susceptible Escherichia coli strain, we demonstrated that evernimicin also inhibited protein synthesis in E. coli. In cell-free translation assays with extracts from either E. coli or S. aureus, evernimicin had a 50% inhibitory concentration of approximately 125 nM. In contrast, cell-free systems derived from wheat germ and rabbit reticulocytes were inhibited only by very high levels of evernimicin. Evernimicin did not promote transcript misreading. [(14)C]evernimicin specifically bound to the 50S subunit from E. coli. Nonlinear regression analysis of binding data generated with 70S ribosomes from E. coli and S. aureus and 50S subunits from E. coli returned dissociation constants of 84, 86, and 160 nM, respectively. In binding experiments, performed in the presence of excess quantities of a selection of antibiotics known to bind to the 50S subunit, only the structurally similar drug avilamycin blocked binding of [(14)C]evernimicin to ribosomes.	1
Title: Nonribosomal biosynthesis of fusaricidins by Paenibacillus polymyxa PKB1 involves direct activation of a D-amino acid Abstract: Paenibacillus polymyxa PKB1 produces fusaricidins, a family of lipopeptide antibiotics that strongly inhibits the growth of many plant pathogenic fungi. The fusaricidin biosynthetic gene cluster was cloned and sequenced, and it spans 32.4 kb, including an open reading frame (fusA) encoding a six-module nonribosomal peptide synthetase. The second, fourth, and fifth modules of fusaricidin synthetase each contain an epimerization domain, consistent with the structure of fusaricidins. However, no epimerization domain is found in the sixth module, corresponding to D-Ala. This sixth adenylation domain was produced at a high level in Escherichia coli and is shown to activate D-Ala specifically, providing evidence for direct activation of a D-amino acid by a prokaryotic peptide synthetase. The fusaricidin gene cluster also includes genes involved in the biosynthesis of the lipid moiety, but no genes for resistance, regulation, or transport functions were encountered.	1
Title: Calcium-dependent protein phosphorylation and dephosphorylation in intact brain neurons in culture Abstract: Preincubation of intact fetal rat brain neurons in culture with 32Pi results in the incorporation of 32Pi into about 20 specific proteins. Upon stimulation by electrical field stimulation or by K+-induced depolarization, highly significant calcium-dependent increase in phosphorylation of a protein of app. Mr 43 000 and decrease in phosphorylation of an app. Mr 55 000 protein occur. These changes can be attributed to the entry of Ca2+ into the cellular cytoplasm since they can occur upon selective permeabilization of the cell membrane to Ca2+ by the Ca2+-ionophore A23187 and are not observed upon stimulation of the cells in the presence of the Ca2+ channel blocker D-600. These data suggest that these phosphoproteins may be involved in the regulation of processes underlying neurotransmitter release.	0
Title: AvrXa10 contains an acidic transcriptional activation domain in the functionally conserved C terminus Abstract: The avrXa10 gene of Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae, the causal agent of bacterial blight of rice, is a member of the avrBs3 avirulence gene family and directs the elicitation of resistance in a gene-for-gene manner on rice lines carrying the resistance gene Xa10. The carboxyl (C) terminus of AvrXa10 has a previously undescribed domain that is structurally similar to the acidic activation domain of many eukaryotic transcription factors in addition to three nuclear localization signal (NLS) sequences. Removal of the C-terminal 38 codons containing the putative activation domain, but retaining the NLS sequences, was concomitant with the loss of avirulence activity. The C-terminal coding regions of avrBs3 and avrXa7 can be replaced by the corresponding region of avrXa10, and the genes retained specificity for the resistance genes Bs3 in pepper and Xa7 in rice, respectively. The avrBs3 and avrXa7 avirulence activities of the hybrid genes were also lost upon removal of the terminal 38 codons. When fused to the coding sequence of the Gal4 DNA binding domain, AvrXa10 activated transcription in yeast and Arabidopsis thaliana. Removal of the carboxyl region severely reduced transcriptional activation. AvrXa10 would have to be localized to the host cell nucleus to function autonomously in transcriptional activation. Consistent with this requirement, mutations in all three NLS sequences of avrXa10 caused a loss in avirulence activity. The findings demonstrate the requirement of the C terminus for AvrXa10 function and the potential for the members of this family of avirulence gene products to enter the host nucleus and alter host transcription.	0
Title: Regulation of secondary metabolism by chromatin structure and epigenetic codes Abstract: Chromatin, composed of DNA wrapped around an octamer of histones, is the relevant substrate for all genetic processes in eukaryotic nuclei. Changes in chromatin structure are associated with the activation and silencing of gene transcription and reversible post-translational modifications of histones are now known to direct chromatin structure transitions. Recent studies in several fungal species have identified a chromatin-based regulation of secondary metabolism (SM) gene clusters representing an upper-hierarchical level for the coordinated control of large chromosomal elements. Regulation by chromatin transition processes provides a mechanistic model to explain how different SM clusters located at dispersed genomic regions can be simultaneously silenced during primary metabolism. Activation of SM clusters has been shown to be associated with increased acetylation of histones H3 and H4 and, consequently, inhibition of histone de-acetylase activities also leads to increased production of secondary metabolites. New findings suggest that SM clusters are silenced by heterochromatic histone marks and that the "closed" heterochromatic structures are reversed during SM activation. This process is mediated by the conserved activator of SM, LaeA. Despite the increase in knowledge about these processes, much remains to be learned from chromatin-level regulation of SM. For example, which proteins "position" the chromatin restructuring signal onto SM clusters or how exactly LaeA works to mediate the low level of heterochromatic marks inside different clusters remain open questions. Answers to these and other chromatin-related questions would certainly complete our understanding of SM gene regulation and signaling and, because for many predicted SM clusters corresponding products have not been identified so far, anti-silencing strategies would open new ways for the identification of novel bioactive substances.	0
Title: A two-step sulfation in antibiotic biosynthesis requires a type III polyketide synthase Abstract: Caprazamycins (CPZs) belong to a group of liponucleoside antibiotics inhibiting the bacterial MraY translocase, an essential enzyme involved in peptidoglycan biosynthesis. We have recently identified analogs that are decorated with a sulfate group at the 2″-hydroxy of the aminoribosyl moiety, and we now report an unprecedented two-step sulfation mechanism during the biosynthesis of CPZs. A type III polyketide synthase (PKS) known as Cpz6 is used in the biosynthesis of a group of new triketide pyrones that are subsequently sulfated by an unusual 3'-phosphoadenosine-5'-phosphosulfate (PAPS)-dependent sulfotransferase (Cpz8) to yield phenolic sulfate esters, which serve as sulfate donors for a PAPS-independent arylsulfate sulfotransferase (Cpz4) to generate sulfated CPZs. This finding is to our knowledge the first demonstration of genuine sulfate donors for an arylsulfate sulfotransferase and the first report of a type III PKS to generate a chemical reagent in bacterial sulfate metabolism.	1
Title: Skn1 and Ipt1 negatively regulate autophagy in Saccharomyces cerevisiae Abstract: We demonstrated that a yeast deletion mutant in IPT1 and SKN1, encoding proteins involved in the biosynthesis of mannosyldiinositolphosphoryl ceramides, is characterized by increased autophagy and DNA fragmentation upon nitrogen (N) starvation as compared with the single deletion mutants or wild type (WT). Apoptotic features were not significantly different between single and double deletion mutants upon N starvation, pointing to increased autophagy in the double Deltaipt1 Deltaskn1 deletion mutant independent of apoptosis. We observed increased basal levels of phytosphingosine in membranes of the double Deltaipt1 Deltaskn1 deletion mutant as compared with the single deletion mutants or WT. These data point to a negative regulation of autophagy by both Ipt1 and Skn1 in yeast, with a putative involvement of phytosphingosine in this process.	0
Title: Total Synthesis of (-)-Nodulisporic Acid D Abstract: A convergent total synthesis of the architecturally complex indole diterpenoid (-)-nodulisporic acid D has been achieved. Key synthetic transformations include vicinal difunctionalization of an advanced α,β-unsaturated aldehyde to form the E,F-trans-fused 5,6-ring system of the eastern hemisphere and a cascade cross-coupling/indolization protocol leading to the CDE multisubstituted indole core.	0
Title: Biochemical characterization of the SgcA1 alpha-D-glucopyranosyl-1-phosphate thymidylyltransferase from the enediyne antitumor antibiotic C-1027 biosynthetic pathway and overexpression of sgcA1 in Streptomyces globisporus to improve C-1027 production Abstract: Sequence analysis of the biosynthetic gene cluster for the enediyne antitumor antibiotic C-1027 from Streptomyces globisporus has previously suggested that the sgcA1 gene encodes a alpha-d-glucopyranosyl-1-phosphate thymidylyltransferase (Glc-1-P-TT) catalyzing the first step in the biosynthesis of the 4-deoxy-4-(dimethylamino)-5,5-dimethyl-d-ribopyranose moiety by activating alpha-d-glucopyranosyl-1-phosphate (Glc-1-P) into deoxythymidine diphosphate-alpha-d-glucose (dTDP-Glc). Here we report the overexpression of sgcA1 in E. coli, purification of the overproduced SgcA1 to homogenetity, biochemical and kinetic characterization of the purified SgcA1 as a Glc-1-P-TT, and yield improvement for C-1027 production by overexpression of sgcA1 and its flanking gene in S. globisporus. These findings provide biochemical evidence supporting the genetics-based hypothesis for C-1027 biosynthesis, set the stage for further investigation of the deoxysugar biosynthetic pathway, and demonstrate the utility of sugar biosynthesis genes in natural product yield improvement via combinatorial biosynthesis methods. In contrast to the homotetrameric quaternary structure known for Glc-1-P-TT enzymes from primary metabolic pathways, Glc-1-P-TT enzymes such as SgcA1 from secondary metabolic pathways are monomeric in solution. Sequence differences between the two subclasses of Glc-1-P-TT enzymes were noted. The monomeric structural feature of the latter enzymes could be exploited in engineering Glc-1-P-TT enzymes with broad substrate specificity for structural diversity via the glycorandomization strategy.	1
Title: Natural enemies drive geographic variation in plant defenses Abstract: Plants defend themselves against attack by natural enemies, and these defenses vary widely across populations. However, whether communities of natural enemies are a sufficiently potent force to maintain polymorphisms in defensive traits is largely unknown. Here, we exploit the genetic resources of Arabidopsis thaliana, coupled with 39 years of field data on aphid abundance, to (i) demonstrate that geographic patterns in a polymorphic defense locus (GS-ELONG) are strongly correlated with changes in the relative abundance of two specialist aphids; and (ii) demonstrate differential selection by the two aphids on GS-ELONG, using a multigeneration selection experiment. We thereby show a causal link between variation in abundance of the two specialist aphids and the geographic pattern at GS-ELONG, which highlights the potency of natural enemies as selective forces.	0
Title: Penetration of beta-lactam antibiotics into their target enzymes in Pseudomonas aeruginosa: comparison of a highly sensitive mutant with its parent strain Abstract: Pseudomonas aeruginosa K 799/WT and a mutant of this strain, P. aeruginosa K 799/61 ("mutant 61"), that is very sensitive to most beta-lactam antibiotics tested were used to assess the importance of penetration barriers in the resistance of P. aeruginosa to penicillins and cephalosporins. The affinities of various beta-lactams to the penicillin-binding proteins found in membranes prepared from both strains were compared by measuring their competition for the binding of benzyl[14C] penicillin to each of these proteins. Only minor differences between the wild type and the mutant 61 were found. The high sensitivity of the mutant therefore cannot be attributed to drastic alterations of these target proteins, nor can the resistance of the wild type be ascribed to penicillin-binding proteins with low affinities for beta-lactams. Experiments in which the ease of penetration of beta-lactams into the penicillin-binding proteins was measured with exponentially growing intact cells instead of membranes, however, clearly demonstrated an easy access of beta-lactam antibiotics to these proteins in the mutant and an efficient exclusion from the same targets in the wild type.	0
Title: Thiol-activated gem-dithiols: a new class of controllable hydrogen sulfide donors Abstract: A class of novel thiol-activated H2S donors has been developed on the basis of the gem-dithiol template. These donors release H2S in the presence of cysteine or GSH in aqueous solutions as well as in cellular environments.	0
Title: Impact of mammalian cell culture conditions on monoclonal antibody charge heterogeneity: an accessory monitoring tool for process development Abstract: Recombinant monoclonal antibodies are predominantly produced in mammalian cell culture bioprocesses. Post-translational modifications affect the micro-heterogeneity of the product and thereby influence important quality attributes, such as stability, solubility, pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics. The analysis of the surface charge distribution of monoclonal antibodies provides aggregated information about these modifications. In this work, we established a direct injection pH gradient cation exchange chromatography method, which determines charge heterogeneity from cell culture supernatant without any purification steps. This tool was further applied to monitor processes that were performed under certain process conditions. Concretely, we were able to provide insights into charge variant formation during a fed-batch process of a Chinese hamster ovary cell culture, in turn producing a monoclonal antibody under varying temperatures and glucose feed strategies. Glucose concentration impacted the total emergence of acidic variants, whereas the variation of basic species was mainly dependent on process temperature. The formation rates of acidic species were described with a second-order reaction, where a temperature increase favored the conversion. This platform method will aid as a sophisticated optimization tool for mammalian cell culture processes. It provides a quality fingerprint for the produced mAb, which can be tested, compared to the desired target and confirmed early in the process chain.	0
Title: Cloning and expression in Escherichia coli of pectinase genes of Erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora Abstract: Genes coding for an endo-pectate lyase, an exo-pectate lyase, and an endopolygalacturonase of Erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora Ecc71 were cloned in Escherichia coli HB101, using the cosmid pHC79. The products of the cloned pectinase genes paralleled their counterparts in strain Ecc71 in isoelectric mobility, mode of substrate degradation, and ability to macerate potato tuber tissue.	0
Title: Enantioselective CuH-Catalyzed Hydroacylation Employing Unsaturated Carboxylic Acids as Aldehyde Surrogates Abstract: The direct asymmetric copper hydride (CuH)-catalyzed coupling of α,β-unsaturated carboxylic acids to aryl alkenes to access chiral α-aryl dialkyl ketones is reported. A variety of substrate substitution patterns, sensitive functional groups, and heterocycles are tolerated in this reaction, which significantly expands the range of accessible products compared with existing hydroacylation methodology. Although mechanistic studies are ongoing, we propose that CuH-catalyzed silylation of unsaturated acids occurs to access a uniquely effective acyl electrophilic coupling partner.	0
Title: Characterization of the Biosynthetic Gene Cluster for the Antibiotic Armeniaspirols in Streptomyces armeniacus Abstract: Armeniaspirols (1-3) are potent antibiotics against Gram-positive pathogens. Through a biosynthetic investigation, we identified four enzymes involved in the structural modification of 1-3. Manipulation of their activity led to the generation of 4-6 and nine novel analogues, 7-15. Bioactivity assessments revealed that the pyrrole chloro group and the methyl group are important for the antimicrobial activities of armeniaspirols, which lays the foundation for future structure optimization and mechanism of action studies of armeniaspirols.	1
Title: Simultaneous Semimechanistic Population Analyses of Levofloxacin in Plasma, Lung, and Prostate To Describe the Influence of Efflux Transporters on Drug Distribution following Intravenous and Intratracheal Administration Abstract: Levofloxacin (LEV) is a broad-spectrum fluoroquinolone used to treat pneumonia, urinary tract infections, chronic bacterial bronchitis, and prostatitis. Efflux transporters, primarily P-glycoprotein (P-gp), are involved in LEV's tissue penetration. In the present work, LEV free lung and prostate interstitial space fluid (ISF) concentrations were evaluated by microdialysis in Wistar rats after intravenous (i.v.) and intratracheal (i.t.) administration (7 mg/kg of body weight) with and without coadministration of the P-gp inhibitor tariquidar (TAR; 15 mg/kg administered i.v.). Plasma and tissue concentration/time profiles were evaluated by noncompartmental analysis (NCA) and population pharmacokinetics (popPK) analysis. The NCA showed significant differences in bioavailability (F) for the control group (0.4) and the TAR group (0.86) after i.t. administration. A four-compartment model simultaneously characterized total plasma and free lung (compartment 2) and prostate (compartment 3) ISF concentrations. Statistically significant differences in lung and prostate average ISF concentrations and levels of kidney active secretion in the TAR group from those measured for the control group (LEV alone) were observed. The estimated population means were as follows: volume of the central compartment (V1), 0.321 liters; total plasma clearance (CL), 0.220 liters/h; TAR plasma clearance (CLTAR), 0.180 liters/h. The intercompartmental distribution rate constants (K values) were as follows: K12, 8.826 h(-1); K21, 7.271 h(-1); K13, 0.047 h(-1); K31, 7.738 h(-1); K14, 0.908 h(-1); K41, 0.409 h(-1); K21 lung TAR (K21LTAR), 8.883 h(-1); K31 prostate TAR (K31PTAR), 4.377 h(-1). The presence of P-gp considerably impacted the active renal secretion of LEV but had only a minor impact on the efflux from the lung following intratracheal dosing. Our results strongly support the idea of a role of efflux transporters other than P-gp contributing to LEV's tissue penetration into the prostrate.	0
Title: reGenotyper: Detecting mislabeled samples in genetic data Abstract: In high-throughput molecular profiling studies, genotype labels can be wrongly assigned at various experimental steps; the resulting mislabeled samples seriously reduce the power to detect the genetic basis of phenotypic variation. We have developed an approach to detect potential mislabeling, recover the "ideal" genotype and identify "best-matched" labels for mislabeled samples. On average, we identified 4% of samples as mislabeled in eight published datasets, highlighting the necessity of applying a "data cleaning" step before standard data analysis.	0
Title: Discovery of a widely distributed toxin biosynthetic gene cluster Abstract: Bacteriocins represent a large family of ribosomally produced peptide antibiotics. Here we describe the discovery of a widely conserved biosynthetic gene cluster for the synthesis of thiazole and oxazole heterocycles on ribosomally produced peptides. These clusters encode a toxin precursor and all necessary proteins for toxin maturation and export. Using the toxin precursor peptide and heterocycle-forming synthetase proteins from the human pathogen Streptococcus pyogenes, we demonstrate the in vitro reconstitution of streptolysin S activity. We provide evidence that the synthetase enzymes, as predicted from our bioinformatics analysis, introduce heterocycles onto precursor peptides, thereby providing molecular insight into the chemical structure of streptolysin S. Furthermore, our studies reveal that the synthetase exhibits relaxed substrate specificity and modifies toxin precursors from both related and distant species. Given our findings, it is likely that the discovery of similar peptidic toxins will rapidly expand to existing and emerging genomes.	1
Title: Analysis of genes involved in the biosynthesis of lantibiotic epidermin Abstract: The structural gene of the lanthionine-containing peptide antibiotic epidermin is located on a 54-kb plasmid of Staphylococcus epidermidis [Schnell et al. (1988) Nature 333, 276-278]. A 13.5-kb DNA region neighbouring the epidermin structural gene (epiA) was subcloned and its sequencing revealed five additional open reading frames. Three of these reading frames, epiB, epiC and epiD shared no homology with previously described proteins stored in data bases. They were located 3' adjacent to epiA. Using epiB as a probe, a 5-kb mRNA was identified indicating that three or all four reading frames are transcribed as an operon. Additionally, a 0.3-kb mRNA specific for epiA was identified. Two open reading frames (epiP and epiQ) were located 3' to epiA, epiB, epiC and epiD, but in the reverse orientation. The epiQ gene product shows similarity to the positive regulatory factor PhoB. This might indicate a regulatory function of epiQ in epidermin biosynthesis. The epiP gene product shows striking similarity to several serine proteases which makes epiP a likely candidate for processing the epidermin prepeptide. Heterologous epidermin synthesis in the non-producing organism Staphylococcus carnosus finally proved that these reading frames are necessary for epidermin biosynthesis.	1
Title: Nucleotide sequence of the tcmII-tcmIV region of the tetracenomycin C biosynthetic gene cluster of Streptomyces glaucescens and evidence that the tcmN gene encodes a multifunctional cyclase-dehydratase-O-methyl transferase Abstract: Mutations in the tcmII-tcmIV region of the Streptomyces glaucescens chromosome block the C-3 and C-8 O-methylations of the polyketide antibiotic tetracenomycin C (Tcm C). The nucleotide sequence of this region reveals the presence of two genes, tcmN and tcmO, whose deduced protein products display similarity to the hydroxyindole O-methyl transferase of the bovine pineal gland, an enzyme that catalyzes a phenolic O-methylation analogous to those required for the biosynthesis of Tcm C. The deduced product of the tcmN gene also has an N-terminal domain that shows similarity to the putative ActVII and WhiE ORFVI proteins of Streptomyces coelicolor. The tcmN N-terminal domain can be separated from the remainder of the tcmN gene product, and when coupled on a plasmid with the Tcm C polyketide synthase genes (tcmKLM), this domain enables high-level production of an early, partially cyclized intermediate of Tcm C in a Tcm C- null mutant or in a heterologous host (Streptomyces lividans). By analogy to fatty acid biosynthesis, the tcmKLM polyketide synthase gene products are probably sufficient to produce the linear decaketide precursor of Tcm C; thus, the tcmN N-terminal domain is most likely responsible for one or more of the early cyclizations and, perhaps, the attendant dehydrations that lead to the partially cyclized intermediate. The tcmN gene therefore appears to encode a multifunctional cyclase-dehydratase-3-O-methyl transferase. The tcmO gene encodes the 8-O-methyl transferase.	1
Title: Discovery of ammosesters by mining the Streptomyces uncialis DCA2648 genome revealing new insight into ammosamide biosynthesis Abstract: The ammosamides (AMMs) are a family of pyrroloquinoline alkaloids that exhibits a wide variety of bioactivities. A biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) that is highly homologous in both gene content and genetic organization to the amm BGC was identified by mining the Streptomyces uncialis DCA2648 genome, leading to the discovery of a sub-family of new AMM congeners, named ammosesters (AMEs). The AMEs feature a C-4a methyl ester, differing from the C-4a amide functional group characteristic to AMMs, and exhibit modest cytotoxicity against a broad spectrum of human cancer cell lines, expanding the structure-activity relationship for the pyrroloquinoline family of natural products. Comparative analysis of the ame and amm BGCs supports the use of a scaffold peptide as an emerging paradigm for the biosynthesis of the pyrroloquinoline family of natural products. AME and AMM biosynthesis diverges from a common intermediate by evolving the pathway-specific Ame24 O-methyltransferase and Amm20 amide synthetase, respectively. These findings will surely inspire future efforts to mimic Nature's combinatorial biosynthetic strategies for natural product structural diversity.	1
Title: Identification of the Polyketide Biosynthetic Machinery for the Indolizidine Alkaloid Cyclizidine Abstract: The cyclizidine biosynthetic gene cluster was identified from Streptomyces NCIB 11649, which revealed the polyketide biosynthetic machinery for cyclizidine alkaloid biosynthesis. Both in vivo mutagenesis study and in vitro biochemical analysis provided insight into the timing and mechanism of the biosynthetic enzymes that produce cyclizidine-type indolizidine alkaloids.	1
Title: Identification of Neuroprotective Spoxazomicin and Oxachelin Glycosides via Chemoenzymatic Glycosyl-Scanning Abstract: The assessment of glycosyl-scanning to expand the molecular and functional diversity of metabolites from the underground coal mine fire-associated Streptomyces sp. RM-14-6 is reported. Using the engineered glycosyltransferase OleD Loki and a 2-chloro-4-nitrophenylglycoside-based screen, six metabolites were identified as substrates of OleD Loki, from which 12 corresponding metabolite glycosides were produced and characterized. This study highlights the first application of the 2-chloro-4-nitrophenylglycoside-based screen toward an unbiased set of unique microbial natural products and the first reported application of the 2-chloro-4-nitrophenylglycoside-based transglycosylation reaction for the corresponding preparative synthesis of target glycosides. Bioactivity analysis (including antibacterial, antifungal, anticancer, and EtOH damage neuroprotection assays) revealed glycosylation to attenuate the neuroprotective potency of 4, while glycosylation of the structurally related inactive spoxazomicin C (3) remarkably invoked neuroprotective activity.	0
Title: Bifunctional TaqII restriction endonuclease: redefining the prototype DNA recognition site and establishing the Fidelity Index for partial cleaving Abstract: Background:                       The TaqII enzyme is a member of the Thermus sp. enzyme family that we propounded previously within Type IIS restriction endonucleases, containing related thermophilic bifunctional endonucleases-methyltransferases from various Thermus sp.: TaqII, Tth111II, TthHB27I, TspGWI, TspDTI and TsoI. These enzymes show significant nucleotide and amino acid sequence similarities, a rare phenomenon among restriction endonucleases, along with similarities in biochemical properties, molecular size, DNA recognition sequences and cleavage sites. They also feature some characteristics of Types I and III.                  Results:                       Barker et al. reported the Type IIS/IIC restriction endonuclease TaqII as recognizing two distinct cognate site variants (5'-GACCGA-3' and 5'-CACCCA-3') while cleaving 11/9 nucleotides downstream. We used four independent methods, namely, shotgun cloning and sequencing, restriction pattern analysis, digestion of particular custom substrates and GeneScan analysis, to demonstrate that the recombinant enzyme recognizes only 5'-GACCGA-3' sites and cleaves 11/9 nucleotides downstream. We did not observe any 5'-CACCCA-3' cleavage under a variety of conditions and site arrangements tested. We also characterized the enzyme biochemically and established new digestion conditions optimal for practical enzyme applications. Finally, we developed and propose a new version of the Fidelity Index - the Fidelity Index for Partial Cleavage (FI-PC).                  Conclusions:                       The DNA recognition sequence of the bifunctional prototype TaqII endonuclease-methyltransferase from Thermus aquaticus has been redefined as recognizing only 5'-GACCGA-3' cognate sites. The reaction conditions (pH and salt concentrations) were designed either to minimize (pH = 8.0 and 10 mM ammonium sulphate) or to enhance star activity (pH = 6.0 and no salt). Redefinition of the recognition site and reaction conditions makes this prototype endonuclease a useful tool for DNA manipulation; as yet, this enzyme has no practical applications. The extension of the Fidelity Index will be helpful for DNA manipulation with enzymes only partially cleaving DNA.	0
Title: Cryptosporidium parvum appears to lack a plastid genome Abstract: Surprisingly, unlike most Apicomplexa, Cryptosporidium parvum appears to lack a plastid genome. Primers based upon the highly conserved plastid small- or large-subunit rRNA (SSU/LSU rRNA) and the tufA-tRNAPhe genes of other members of the phylum Apicomplexa failed to amplify products from intracellular stages of C. parvum, whereas products were obtained from the plastid-containing apicomplexans Eimeria bovis and Toxoplasma gondii, as well as the plants Allium stellatum and Spinacia oleracea. Dot-blot hybridization of sporozoite genomic DNA (gDNA) supported these PCR results. A T. gondii plastid-specific set of probes containing SSU/LSU rRNA and tufA-tRNA(Phe) genes strongly hybridized to gDNA from a diverse group of plastid-containing organisms including three Apicomplexa, two plants, and Euglena gracilis, but not to those without this organelle including C. parvum, three kinetoplastids, the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, mammals and the eubacterium Escherichia coli. Since the origin of the plastid in other apicomplexans is postulated to be the result of a secondary symbiogenesis of either a red or a green alga, the most parsimonious explanation for its absence in C. parvum is that it has been secondarily lost. If confirmed, this would indicate an alternative evolutionary fate for this organelle in one member of the Apicomplexa. It also suggests that unlike the situation with other diseases caused by members of the Apicomplexa, drug development against cryptosporidiosis targeting a plastid genome or metabolic pathways associated with it may not be useful.	0
Title: Deciphering pactamycin biosynthesis and engineered production of new pactamycin analogues Abstract: Pactamycin is an aminocyclopentitol-derived natural product that has potent antibacterial and antitumor activities. Sequence analysis of an 86 kb continuous region of the chromosome from Streptomyces pactum ATCC 27456 revealed a gene cluster involved in the biosynthesis of pactamycin. Gene inactivation of the Fe-S radical SAM oxidoreductase (ptmC) and the glycosyltransferase (ptmJ), individually abrogated pactamycin biosynthesis; this confirmed the involvement of the ptm gene cluster in pactamycin biosynthesis. The polyketide synthase gene (ptmQ) was found to support 6-methylsalicylic acid (6-MSA) synthesis in a heterologous host, S. lividans T7. In vivo inactivation of ptmQ in S. pactum impaired pactamycin and pactamycate production but led to production of two new pactamycin analogues, de-6-MSA-pactamycin and de-6-MSA-pactamycate. The new compounds showed equivalent cytotoxic and antibacterial activities with the corresponding parent molecules and shed more light on the structure-activity relationship of pactamycin.	1
Title: Triterpenes from Pholiota populnea as Cytotoxic Agents and Chemosensitizers to Overcome Multidrug Resistance of Cancer Cells Abstract: The detailed mycochemical analysis of the n-hexane extract of Pholiota populnea led to the isolation of four new lanostane diesters, named pholiols A-D (1-4), together with an acyclic triterpene, (3S,6E,10E,14E,18E,22S)-2,3,22,23-tetrahydroxy-2,6,10,15,19,23-hexamethyl-6,10,14,18-tetracosatetraene (5), ergosterol (6), and 3β-hydroxyergosta-7,22-diene (7). The isolation was carried out by multistep flash chromatography, and the structures were elucidated using extensive spectroscopic analyses, including 1D and 2D NMR and MS measurements. The isolated metabolites (1-6) were investigated for cytotoxic activity against Colo205 and Colo320 colon adenocarcinoma and nontumoral MRC-5 cell lines. Among the tested compounds, ergosterol (6) showed substantial cytotoxic activity against all cell lines with IC50 values of 4.9 μM (Colo 205), 6.5 μM (Colo 320), and 0.50 μM (MRC) with no tumor cell selectivity. A P-glycoprotein efflux pump modulatory test on resistant Colo320 cells revealed that pholiols A (1) and B (2) and linear triterpene polyol 5 have the capacity to inhibit the efflux-pump overexpressed in the cells. Moreover, the drug interactions of triterpenes with doxorubicin were studied by the checkerboard method on Colo 320 cells. Pholiols B (2) and D (4) interacted in synergistic and acyclic triterpene 5 in a very strong synergistic manner; the combination index (CI) values at 50% of the growth inhibition dose (ED50) were found to be 0.348, 0.660, and 0.082, respectively. Our results indicate that P. populnea is a promising source for finding new triterpenes with significant chemosensitizing activity on cancer cells.	0
Title: CRISPR-Cas9-Based Discovery of the Verrucosidin Biosynthesis Gene Cluster in Penicillium polonicum Abstract: Penicillium polonicum, commonly found on food matrices, is a mycotoxigenic species able to produce a neurotoxin called verrucosidin. This methylated α-pyrone polyketide inhibits oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria and thereby causes neurological diseases. Despite the importance of verrucosidin as a toxin, its biosynthetic genes have not been characterized yet. By similarity analysis with the polyketide synthase (PKS) genes for the α-pyrones aurovertin (AurA) and citreoviridin (CtvA), 16 PKS genes for putative α-pyrones were identified in the P. polonicum genome. A single PKS gene, verA, was found to be transcribed under verrucosidin-producing growth conditions. The annotated functions of the genes neighboring verA correspond to those required for verrucosidin biosynthesis. To prove the involvement of verA in verrucosidin biosynthesis, the clustered regularly interspaced short palindrome repeats (CRISPR) technology was applied to P. polonicum. In vitro reconstituted CRISPR-Cas9 was used to induce targeted gene deletions in P. polonicum. This approach allowed identifying and characterizing the verrucosidin biosynthetic gene cluster. VerA deletion mutants were no longer able to produce verrucosidin, whereas they were displaying morphological characteristics comparable with the wild-type strain. The available CRISPR-Cas9 technology allows characterizing the biosynthetic potential of P. polonicum as a valuable source of novel compounds.	1
Title: Identification and Characterization of Mycemycin Biosynthetic Gene Clusters in Streptomyces olivaceus FXJ8.012 and Streptomyces sp. FXJ1.235 Abstract: Mycemycins A-E are new members of the dibenzoxazepinone (DBP) family, derived from the gntR gene-disrupted deep sea strain Streptomyces olivaceus FXJ8.012Δ1741 and the soil strain Streptomyces sp. FXJ1.235. In this paper, we report the identification of the gene clusters and pathways' inference for mycemycin biosynthesis in the two strains. Bioinformatics analyses of the genome sequences of S. olivaceus FXJ8.012Δ1741 and S. sp. FXJ1.235 predicted two divergent mycemycin gene clusters, mym and mye, respectively. Heterologous expression of the key enzyme genes of mym and genetic manipulation of mye as well as a feeding study in S. sp. FXJ1.235 confirmed the gene clusters and led to the proposed biosynthetic pathways for mycemycins. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on DBP biosynthetic gene clusters and pathways.	1
Title: Para-position derivatives of fungal anthelmintic cyclodepsipeptides engineered with Streptomyces venezuelae antibiotic biosynthetic genes Abstract: PF1022A, a cyclooctadepsipeptide possessing strong anthelmintic properties and produced by the filamentous fungus Rosellinia sp. PF1022, consists of four alternating residues of N-methyl-L-leucine and four residues of D-lactate or D-phenyllactate. PF1022A derivatives obtained through modification of their benzene ring at the para-position with nitro or amino groups act as valuable starting materials for the synthesis of compounds with improved anthelmintic activities. Here we describe the production of such derivatives by fermentation through metabolic engineering of the PF1022A biosynthetic pathway in Rosellinia sp. PF1022. Three genes cloned from Streptomyces venezuelae, and required for the biosynthesis of p-aminophenylpyruvate from chorismate in the chloramphenicol biosynthetic pathway, were expressed in a chorismate mutase-deficient strain derived from Rosellinia sp. PF1022. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and NMR analyses confirmed that this approach facilitated the production of PF1022A derivatives specifically modified at the para-position. This fermentation method is environmentally safe and can be used for the industrial scale production of PF1022A derivatives.	1
Title: A putative ABC transporter gene, ZRA1, is required for zearalenone production in Gibberella zeae Abstract: Zearalenone (ZEA) is a secondary metabolite produced by various Fusarium species and causes estrogenic disorders in humans and animals. Recent studies have identified the ZEA biosynthesis gene cluster in F. graminearum, but other genes such as transporters responsible for ZEA export have not been identified in the cluster. In this study, we performed microarray analyses from the wild-type strain with and without ZEA supplementation and ZEA-nonproducing strain zeb2 to discover other genes responsible for ZEA biosynthesis. Three putative ABC transporters were significantly down-regulated in the zeb2 and were under positive regulation of the ZEB2 gene, which functions as a transcriptional activator for ZEA production in this fungus. However, only one gene (ZRA1) was found to be up-regulated by 20-fold in the wild-type strain supplemented with ZEA, and deletion of ZRA1 resulted in reduced ZEA production. Deletions of the other two genes showed similar ZEA productions as the wild-type strain. ZRA1 localized to the plasma membrane and vacuoles indicating possible roles of ZRA1 as a transporter. This study indicated that ZRA1 is involved in ZEA production and shares a common regulatory mode with ZEA cluster genes by ZEB2.	1
Title: Quantum interferometric visibility as a witness of general relativistic proper time Abstract: Current attempts to probe general relativistic effects in quantum mechanics focus on precision measurements of phase shifts in matter-wave interferometry. Yet, phase shifts can always be explained as arising because of an Aharonov-Bohm effect, where a particle in a flat space-time is subject to an effective potential. Here we propose a quantum effect that cannot be explained without the general relativistic notion of proper time. We consider interference of a 'clock'-a particle with evolving internal degrees of freedom-that will not only display a phase shift, but also reduce the visibility of the interference pattern. According to general relativity, proper time flows at different rates in different regions of space-time. Therefore, because of quantum complementarity, the visibility will drop to the extent to which the path information becomes available from reading out the proper time from the 'clock'. Such a gravitationally induced decoherence would provide the first test of the genuine general relativistic notion of proper time in quantum mechanics.	0
Title: Biosynthesis of dTDP-3-acetamido-3,6-dideoxy-alpha-D-galactose in Aneurinibacillus thermoaerophilus L420-91T Abstract: The glycan chain of the S-layer protein of Aneurinibacillus thermoaerophilus L420-91T (DSM 10154) consists of d-rhamnose and 3-acetamido-3,6-dideoxy-d-galactose (d-Fucp3NAc). Thymidine diphosphate-activated d-Fucp3NAc serves as precursor for the assembly of structural polysaccharides in Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms. The biosynthesis of dTDP-3-acetamido-3,6-dideoxy-alpha-d-galactose (dTDP-d-Fucp3NAc) involves five enzymes. The first two steps of the reaction are catalyzed by enzymes that are part of the well studied dTDP-l-rhamnose biosynthetic pathway, namely d-glucose-1-phosphate thymidyltransferase (RmlA) and dTDP-d-glucose-4,6-dehydratase (RmlB). The enzymes catalyzing the last three synthesis reactions have not been characterized biochemically so far. These steps include an isomerase, a transaminase, and a transacetylase. We identified all five genes involved by chromosome walking in the Gram-positive organism A. thermoaerophilus L420-91T and overexpressed the three new enzymes heterologously in Escherichia coli. The activities of these enzymes were monitored by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography, and the intermediate products formed were characterized by 1H and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy analysis. Alignment of the newly identified proteins with known sequences revealed that the elucidated pathway in this Gram-positive organism may also be valid in the biosynthesis of the O-antigen of lipopolysaccharides of Gram-negative organisms. The key enzyme in the biosynthesis of dTDP-d-Fucp3NAc has been identified as an isomerase, which converts the 4-keto educt into the 3-keto product, with concomitant epimerization at C-4 to produce a 6-deoxy-d-xylo configuration. This is the first report of the functional characterization of the biosynthesis of dTDP-d-Fucp3NAc and description of a novel type of isomerase capable of synthesizing dTDP-6-deoxy-d-xylohex-3-ulose from dTDP-6-deoxy-d-xylohex-4-ulose.	1
Title: The highly attenuated oncolytic recombinant vaccinia virus GLV-1h68: comparative genomic features and the contribution of F14.5L inactivation Abstract: As a new anticancer treatment option, vaccinia virus (VACV) has shown remarkable antitumor activities (oncolysis) in preclinical studies, but potential infection of other organs remains a safety concern. We present here genome comparisons between the de novo sequence of GLV-1h68, a recombinant VACV, and other VACVs. The identified differences in open reading frames (ORFs) include genes encoding host-range selection, virulence and immune modulation proteins, e.g., ankyrin-like proteins, serine proteinase inhibitor SPI-2/CrmA, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor homolog CrmC, semaphorin-like and interleukin-1 receptor homolog proteins. Phylogenetic analyses indicate that GLV-1h68 is closest to Lister strains but has lost several ORFs present in its parental LIVP strain, including genes encoding CrmE and a viral Golgi anti-apoptotic protein, v-GAAP. The reduced pathogenicity of GLV-1h68 is confirmed in male mice bearing C6 rat glioma and in immunocompetent mice bearing B16-F10 murine melanoma. The contribution of foreign gene expression cassettes in the F14.5L, J2R and A56R loci is analyzed, in particular the contribution of F14.5L inactivation to the reduced virulence is demonstrated by comparing the virulence of GLV-1h68 with its F14.5L-null and revertant viruses. GLV-1h68 is a promising engineered VACV variant for anticancer therapy with tumor-specific replication, reduced pathogenicity and benign tissue tropism.	0
Title: Nucleation of NaCl from Aqueous Solution: Critical Sizes, Ion-Attachment Kinetics, and Rates Abstract: Nucleation and crystal growth are important in material synthesis, climate modeling, biomineralization, and pharmaceutical formulation. Despite tremendous efforts, the mechanisms and kinetics of nucleation remain elusive to both theory and experiment. Here we investigate sodium chloride (NaCl) nucleation from supersaturated brines using seeded atomistic simulations, polymorph-specific order parameters, and elements of classical nucleation theory. We find that NaCl nucleates via the common rock salt structure. Ion desolvation-not diffusion-is identified as the limiting resistance to attachment. Two different analyses give approximately consistent attachment kinetics: diffusion along the nucleus size coordinate and reaction-diffusion analysis of approach-to-coexistence simulation data from Aragones et al. ( J. Chem. Phys. 2012, 136, 244508 ). Our simulations were performed at realistic supersaturations to enable the first direct comparison to experimental nucleation rates for this system. The computed and measured rates converge to a common upper limit at extremely high supersaturation. However, our rate predictions are between 15 and 30 orders of magnitude too fast. We comment on possible origins of the large discrepancy.	0
Title: Single-bacterial genomics validates rich and varied specialized metabolism of uncultivated Entotheonella sponge symbionts Abstract: Marine sponges are prolific sources of unique bioactive natural products. The sponge Theonella swinhoei is represented by several distinct variants with largely nonoverlapping chemistry. For the Japanese chemotype Y harboring diverse complex polyketides and peptides, we previously provided genomic and functional evidence that a single symbiont, the filamentous, multicellular organism "Candidatus Entotheonella factor," produces almost all of these compounds. To obtain further insights into the chemistry of "Entotheonella," we investigated another phylotype, "Candidatus Entotheonella serta," present in the T. swinhoei WA sponge chemotype, a source of theonellamide- and misakinolide-type compounds. Unexpectedly, considering the lower chemical diversity, sequencing of individual bacterial filaments revealed an even larger number of biosynthetic gene regions than for Ca E. factor, with virtually no overlap. These included genes for misakinolide and theonellamide biosynthesis, the latter assigned by comparative genomic and metabolic analysis of a T. swinhoei chemotype from Israel, and by biochemical studies. The data suggest that both compound families, which were among the earliest model substances to study bacterial producers in sponges, originate from the same bacterium in T. swinhoei WA. They also add evidence that metabolic richness and variability could be a more general feature of Entotheonella symbionts.	1
Title: Tracking down the molecular architecture of the synaptonemal complex by expansion microscopy Abstract: The synaptonemal complex (SC) is a meiosis-specific nuclear multiprotein complex that is essential for proper synapsis, recombination and segregation of homologous chromosomes. We combined structured illumination microscopy (SIM) with different expansion microscopy (ExM) protocols including U-ExM, proExM, and magnified analysis of the proteome (MAP) to investigate the molecular organization of the SC. Comparison with structural data obtained by single-molecule localization microscopy of unexpanded SCs allowed us to investigate ultrastructure preservation of expanded SCs. For image analysis, we developed an automatic image processing software that enabled unbiased comparison of structural properties pre- and post-expansion. Here, MAP-SIM provided the best results and enabled reliable three-color super-resolution microscopy of the SCs of a whole set of chromosomes in a spermatocyte with 20-30 nm spatial resolution. Our data demonstrate that post-expansion labeling by MAP-SIM improves immunolabeling efficiency and allowed us thus to unravel previously hidden details of the molecular organization of SCs.	0
Title: Tailoring of glycopeptide scaffolds by the acyltransferases from the teicoplanin and A-40,926 biosynthetic operons Abstract: The teicoplanin acyltransferase (Atf) responsible for N-acylation of the glucosamine moiety to create the teicoplanin lipoglycopeptide scaffold has recently been identified. Here we use that enzyme (tAtf) and the cognate acyltransferase from the related A-40,926 biosynthetic cluster (aAtf) to evaluate specificity for glycopeptide scaffolds and for the acyl-CoA donor. In addition to acylation of 2-aminoglucosyl glycopeptide scaffolds with k(cat) values of 400-2000 min(-1), both Atfs transfer acyl groups to regioisomeric 6-aminoglucosyl scaffolds and to glucosyl scaffolds at rates of 0.2-0.5 min(-1) to create variant lipoglycopeptides. Using the teicoplanin glycosyltransferase tGtfA, tAtf, and GtfD, a glycosyltransferase from the vancomycin producer, it is possible to assemble a novel lipoglycopeptide with GlcNAc at beta-OH-Tyr(6) and an N(6)-acyl-glucosaminyl-vancosamine at Phegly(4). This study illustrates the utility of chemo- and regioselective acyltransferases and glycosyltransferases to create novel lipoglycopeptides.	1
Title: Near-real-time analysis of the phenotypic responses of Escherichia coli to 1-butanol exposure using Raman Spectroscopy Abstract: Raman spectroscopy was used to study the time course of phenotypic responses of Escherichia coli (DH5α) to 1-butanol exposure (1.2% [vol/vol]). Raman spectroscopy is of interest for bacterial phenotyping because it can be performed (i) in near real time, (ii) with minimal sample preparation (label-free), and (iii) with minimal spectral interference from water. Traditional off-line analytical methodologies were applied to both 1-butanol-treated and control cells to draw correlations with Raman data. Here, distinct sets of Raman bands are presented that characterize phenotypic traits of E. coli with maximized correlation to off-line measurements. In addition, the observed time course phenotypic responses of E. coli to 1.2% (vol/vol) 1-butanol exposure included the following: (i) decreased saturated fatty acids levels, (ii) retention of unsaturated fatty acids and low levels of cyclopropane fatty acids, (iii) increased membrane fluidity following the initial response of increased rigidity, and (iv) no changes in total protein content or protein-derived amino acid composition. For most phenotypic traits, correlation coefficients between Raman spectroscopy and traditional off-line analytical approaches exceeded 0.75, and major trends were captured. The results suggest that near-real-time Raman spectroscopy is suitable for approximating metabolic and physiological phenotyping of bacterial cells subjected to toxic environmental conditions.	0
Title: The first study about the relationship between the extractability of thiacalix[4]arene derivatives and the position of the coordination binding sites Abstract: Three organic ionophores (2-4) based on the p-tert-butylthiacalix[4]arene backbone, blocked in the 1,3-alternate conformation, bearing two pyridyl coordinating moieties (ortho for 2, meta for 3 and para for 4), have been synthesized and characterized in the solid state. The solvent extraction experiments with the metal ions showed that the ability of these derivatives to complex with Ag(+) appeared to be largely dependent on the position of the nitrogen atoms of the pyridyl ring. Two different complexation modes have been confirmed by 1H NMR titration. Ionophore 2 armed with two pyridyl moieties, complexed with Ag(+) cation through N···Ag(+)···S interactions; however, ionophore 3 and ionophore 4 complexed with Ag(+) through metal-nitrogen (N···Ag(+)) interactions. The DFT computational studies were consistent with the experimental findings. These findings will provide us with an important rule to design an appropriate thiacalix[4]arene ionophore in the future. Another study on the possibility for application of ionophores 2-4 for the treatment of waste water containing Cr(VI) and Cr(III), showed that ionophore 3 was useful in the application of the solvent extraction method in selective treatment of waste water containing Cr(VI) and Cr(III) prior to discharge.	0
Title: Clorobiocin biosynthesis in Streptomyces: identification of the halogenase and generation of structural analogs Abstract: Clorobiocin (clo) and novobiocin (nov) are potent inhibitors of bacterial DNA gyrase. The two substances differ in the substitution pattern at C-8' of the aminocoumarin ring, carrying a chlorine atom or a methyl group, respectively. By gene inactivation, clo-hal was identified as the gene of the halogenase responsible for the introduction of the chlorine atom of clorobiocin. Inactivation of cloZ did not affect clorobiocin formation, showing that this ORF is not essential for clorobiocin biosynthesis. Expression of the methyltransferase gene novO in the clo-hal(-) mutant led to the very efficient formation of a hybrid antibiotic containing a methyl group instead of a chlorine atom at C-8'. Comparison of the antibacterial activity of clorobiocin analogs with -Cl, -H, or -CH(3) at C-8' showed that chlorine leads to 8-fold higher activity than hydrogen and to 2-fold higher activity than a methyl group.	1
Title: The opcA and (psi)opcB regions in Neisseria: genes, pseudogenes, deletions, insertion elements and DNA islands Abstract: Previous data have indicated that the opc gene encoding an immunogenic invasin is specific to Neisseria meningitidis (Nm) and is lacking in Neisseria gonorrhoeae (Ng). The data presented here show that Nm and Ng both contain two paralogous opc-like genes, opcA, corresponding to the former opc gene, and (psi)opcB, a pseudogene. The predicted OpcA and OpcB proteins possess transmembrane regions with conserved non-polar faces but differ extensively in four of the five surface-exposed loops. Gonococcal OpcA was expressed weakly under in vitro conditions, and it is unknown whether these bacteria can express this protein at high levels. Analysis of the sequences flanking opcA and (psi)opcB revealed a framework of conserved housekeeping genes interspersed with DNA islands. These regions also contained several pseudogenes, deletions and IS elements, attesting to considerable genome plasticity. Both opcA and (psi)opcB are located on DNA islands that have probably been imported from unrelated bacteria. A third island encodes the dcmD/dcrD R/M genes in Ng versus a small open reading frame in most strains of Nm. Rare strains of Nm were identified in which the R/M island has been imported. DNA islands in Nm and Ng seem to have been acquired by recombination via conserved flanking housekeeping genes rather than by insertion of mobile genetic elements.	0
Title: Anticancer and multidrug resistance-reversal effects of solanidine analogs synthetized from pregnadienolone acetate Abstract: A set of solanidine analogs with antiproliferative properties were recently synthetized from pregnadienolone acetate, which occurs in Nature. The aim of the present study was an in vitro characterization of their antiproliferative action and an investigation of their multidrug resistance-reversal activity on cancer cells. Six of the compounds elicited the accumulation of a hypodiploid population of HeLa cells, indicating their apoptosis-inducing character, and another one caused cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase. The most effective agents inhibited the activity of topoisomerase I, as evidenced by plasmid supercoil relaxation assays. One of the most potent analogs down-regulated the expression of cell-cycle related genes at the mRNA level, including tumor necrosis factor alpha and S-phase kinase-associated protein 2, and induced growth arrest and DNA damage protein 45 alpha. Some of the investigated compounds inhibited the ABCB1 transporter and caused rhodamine-123 accumulation in murine lymphoma cells transfected by human MDR1 gene, expressing the efflux pump (L5178). One of the most active agents in this aspect potentiated the antiproliferative action of doxorubicin without substantial intrinsic cytostatic capacity. The current results indicate that the modified solanidine skeleton is a suitable substrate for the rational design and synthesis of further innovative drug candidates with anticancer activities.	0
Title: Solution structure of the cap-independent translational enhancer and ribosome-binding element in the 3' UTR of turnip crinkle virus Abstract: The 3(') untranslated region (3(') UTR) of turnip crinkle virus (TCV) genomic RNA contains a cap-independent translation element (CITE), which includes a ribosome-binding structural element (RBSE) that participates in recruitment of the large ribosomal subunit. In addition, a large symmetric loop in the RBSE plays a key role in coordinating the incompatible processes of viral translation and replication, which require enzyme progression in opposite directions on the viral template. To understand the structural basis for the large ribosomal subunit recruitment and the intricate interplay among different parts of the molecule, we determined the global structure of the 102-nt RBSE RNA using solution NMR and small-angle x-ray scattering. This RNA has many structural features that resemble those of a tRNA in solution. The hairpins H1 and H2, linked by a 7-nucleotide linker, form the upper part of RBSE and hairpin H3 is relatively independent from the rest of the structure and is accessible to interactions. This global structure provides insights into the three-dimensional layout for ribosome binding, which may serve as a structural basis for its involvement in recruitment of the large ribosomal subunit and the switch between viral translation and replication. The experimentally determined three-dimensional structure of a functional element in the 3(') UTR of an RNA from any organism has not been previously reported. The RBSE structure represents a prototype structure of a new class of RNA structural elements involved in viral translation/replication processes.	0
Title: Involvement of the β3-α3 loop of the proline dehydrogenase domain in allosteric regulation of membrane association of proline utilization A Abstract: Proline utilization A (PutA) from Escherichia coli is a membrane-associated trifunctional flavoenzyme that catalyzes the oxidation of proline to glutamate and moonlights as a transcriptional regulator. As a regulatory protein, PutA represses transcription of the put regulon, which contains the genes encoding PutA and the proline transporter PutP. The binding of proline to the proline dehydrogenase active site and the subsequent reduction of the flavin induce high affinity membrane association of PutA and relieve repression of the put regulon, thereby causing PutA to switch from its regulatory to its enzymatic role. Here, we present evidence suggesting that residues of the β3-α3 loop of the proline dehydrogenase domain (βα)8 barrel are involved in proline-mediated allosteric regulation of PutA-membrane binding. Mutation of the conserved residues Asp370 and Glu372 in the β3-α3 loop abrogates the ability of proline to induce functional membrane association. Both in vitro lipid/membrane binding assays and in vivo cell-based assays demonstrate that mutagenesis of Asp370 (D370N/A) or Glu372 (E372A) dramatically impedes PutA functional switching. The crystal structures of the proline dehydrogenase domain mutants PutA86-630D370N and PutA86-630D370A complexed with the proline analogue l-tetrahydro-2-furoic acid show that the mutations cause only minor perturbations to the active site but no major structural changes, suggesting that the lack of proline response is not due to a failure of the mutated active sites to correctly bind the substrate. Rather, these results suggest that the β3-α3 loop may be involved in transmitting the status of the proline dehydrogenase active site and flavin redox state to the distal membrane association domain.	0
Title: Biosynthetic characterization and biochemical features of the third natural nisin variant, nisin Q, produced by Lactococcus lactis 61-14 Abstract: Aims:                       To characterize the genetic and biochemical features of nisin Q.                  Methods and results:                       The nisin Q gene cluster was sequenced, and 11 putative orfs having 82% homology with the nisin A biosynthesis gene cluster were identified. Nisin Q production was confirmed from the nisQ-introduced nisin Z producer. In the reporter assay, nisin Q exhibited an induction level that was threefold lower than that of nisin A. Nisin Q demonstrated an antimicrobial spectrum similar to those of the other nisins. Under oxidizing conditions, nisin Q retained a higher level of activity than nisin A. This higher oxidative tolerance could be attributed to the presence of only one methionine residue in nisin Q, in contrast to other nisins that contain two.                  Conclusions:                       The 11 orfs of the nisin producers were identical with regard to their functions. The antimicrobial spectra of the three natural nisins were similar. Nisin Q demonstrated higher oxidative tolerance than nisin A.                  Significance and impact of the study:                       Genetic and biochemical features of nisin Q are similar to those of other variants. Moreover, owing to its higher oxidative tolerance, nisin Q is a potential alternative for nisin A.	1
Title: Hydrogen Sulfide Donors Activated by Reactive Oxygen Species Abstract: Hydrogen sulfide (H2 S) exhibits promising protective effects in many (patho)physiological processes, as evidenced by recent reports using synthetic H2 S donors in different biological models. Herein, we report the design and evaluation of compounds denoted PeroxyTCM, which are the first class of reactive oxygen species (ROS)-triggered H2 S donors. These donors are engineered to release carbonyl sulfide (COS) upon activation, which is quickly hydrolyzed to H2 S by the ubiquitous enzyme carbonic anhydrase (CA). The donors are stable in aqueous solution and do not release H2 S until triggered by ROS, such as hydrogen peroxide (H2 O2 ), superoxide (O2- ), and peroxynitrite (ONOO- ). We demonstrate ROS-triggered H2 S donation in live cells and also demonstrate that PeroxyTCM-1 provides protection against H2 O2 -induced oxidative damage, suggesting potential future applications of PeroxyTCM and similar scaffolds in H2 S-related therapies.	0
Title: Performance and specificity of the covalently linked immunomagnetic separation-ATP method for rapid detection and enumeration of enterococci in coastal environments Abstract: The performance and specificity of the covalently linked immunomagnetic separation-ATP (Cov-IMS/ATP) method for the detection and enumeration of enterococci was evaluated in recreational waters. Cov-IMS/ATP performance was compared with standard methods: defined substrate technology (Enterolert; IDEXX Laboratories), membrane filtration (EPA Method 1600), and an Enterococcus-specific quantitative PCR (qPCR) assay (EPA Method A). We extend previous studies by (i) analyzing the stability of the relationship between the Cov-IMS/ATP method and culture-based methods at different field sites, (ii) evaluating specificity of the assay for seven ATCC Enterococcus species, (iii) identifying cross-reacting organisms binding the antibody-bead complexes with 16S rRNA gene sequencing and evaluating specificity of the assay to five nonenterococcus species, and (iv) conducting preliminary tests of preabsorption as a means of improving the assay. Cov-IMS/ATP was found to perform consistently and with strong agreement rates (based on exceedance/compliance with regulatory limits) of between 83% and 100% compared to the culture-based Enterolert method at a variety of sites with complex inputs. The Cov-IMS/ATP method is specific to five of seven different Enterococcus spp. tested. However, there is potential for nontarget bacteria to bind the antibody, which may be reduced by purification of the IgG serum with preabsorption at problematic sites. The findings of this study help to validate the Cov-IMS/ATP method, suggesting a predictable relationship between the Cov-IMS/ATP method and traditional culture-based methods, which will allow for more widespread application of this rapid and field-portable method for coastal water quality assessment.	0
Title: Genetic and functional analyses of the lgtH gene, a member of the beta-1,4-galactosyltransferase gene family in the genus Neisseria Abstract: Lipooligosaccharide (LOS) is a major virulence factor of the pathogenic Neisseria. Three galactosyltransferase genes, lgtB, lgtE and lgtH, responsible for the biosynthesis of LOS oligosaccharide chains, were analysed in five Neisseria species. The function of lgtH in Neisseria meningitidis 6,275 was determined by mutagenesis and chemical characterization of the parent and mutant LOS chains. The chemical characterization included SDS-PAGE, immunoblot, hexose and mass spectrometry analyses. Compared with the parent LOS, the mutant LOS lacked galactose, and its oligosaccharide decreased by three or four sugar units in matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI)-MS analysis. The results show that lgtH encodes a beta-1,4-galactosyltransferase, and that the glucose moiety linked to heptose (Hep) in the alpha chain is the acceptor site in the biosynthesis of Neisseria LOS. To understand the sequence diversity and relationships of lgtB, lgtE and lgtH, the entire lgt-1 locus was further sequenced in three N. meningitidis strains and three commensal Neisseria strains, and compared with the previously reported lgt genes from Neisseria species. Comparison of the protein sequences of the three enzymes LgtB, LgtE and LgtH showed a conserved N-terminal region, and a highly variable C-terminal region, suggesting functional constraint for substrate and acceptor specificity, respectively. The analyses of allelic variation and evolution of 23 lgtB, 12 lgtE and 14 lgtH sequences revealed a distinct evolutionary history of these genes in Neisseria. For example, the splits graph of lgtE displayed a network evolution, indicating frequent DNA recombination, whereas splits graphs of lgtB and lgtH displayed star-tree-like evolution, indicating the accumulation of point mutations. The data presented here represent examples of the evolution and variation of prokaryotic glycosyltransferase gene families. These imply the existence of multiple enzyme isoforms for biosynthesis of a great diversity of oligosaccharides in nature.	0
Title: Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase from the hyperthermophilic archaebacterium Pyrococcus woesei: characterization of the enzyme, cloning and sequencing of the gene, and expression in Escherichia coli Abstract: The glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase from the hyperthermophilic archaebacterium Pyrococcus woesei (optimal growth temperature, 100 to 103 degrees C) was purified to homogeneity. This enzyme was strictly phosphate dependent, utilized either NAD+ or NADP+, and was insensitive to pentalenolactone like the enzyme from the methanogenic archaebacterium Methanothermus fervidus. The enzyme exhibited a considerable thermostability, with a 44-min half-life at 100 degrees C. The amino acid sequence of the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase from P. woesei was deduced from the nucleotide sequence of the coding gene. Compared with the enzyme homologs from mesophilic archaebacteria (Methanobacterium bryantii, Methanobacterium formicicum) and an extremely thermophilic archaebacterium (Methanothermus fervidus), the primary structure of the P. woesei enzyme exhibited a strikingly high proportion of aromatic amino acid residues and a low proportion of sulfur-containing residues. The coding gene of P. woesei was expressed at a high level in Escherichia coli, thus providing an ideal basis for detailed structural and functional studies of that enzyme.	0
Title: Bacillus anthracis requires siderophore biosynthesis for growth in macrophages and mouse virulence Abstract: Systemic anthrax infections can be characterized as proceeding in stages, beginning with an early intracellular establishment stage within phagocytes that is followed by extracelluar stages involving massive bacteraemia, sepsis and death. Because most bacteria require iron, and the host limits iron availability through homeostatic mechanisms, we hypothesized that B. anthracis requires a high-affinity mechanism of iron acquisition during its growth stages. Two putative types of siderophore synthesis operons, named Bacillus anthracis catechol, bac (anthrabactin), and anthrax siderophore biosynthesis, asb (anthrachelin), were identified. Directed gene deletions in both anthrabactin and anthrachelin pathways were generated in a B. anthracis (Sterne) 34F2 background resulting in mutations in asbA and bacCEBF. A decrease in siderophore production was observed during iron-depleted growth in both the DeltaasbA and DeltabacCEBF strains, but only the DeltaasbA strain was attenuated for growth under these conditions. In addition, the DeltaasbA strain was severely attenuated both for growth in macrophages (MPhi) and for virulence in mice. In contrast, the DeltabacCEBF strain did not differ phenotypically from the parental strain. These findings support a requirement for anthrachelin but not anthrabactin in iron assimilation during the intracellular stage of anthrax.	1
Title: Aryl Group Transfer from Tetraarylborato Anions to an Electrophilic Dicopper(I) Center and Mixed-Valence μ-Aryl Dicopper(I,II) Complexes Abstract: The synthesis of discrete, cationic binuclear μ-aryl dicopper complexes [Cu2(μ-η(1):η(1)-Ar)DPFN]X (Ar = C6H5, 3,5-(CF3)2C6H3, and C6F5; DPFN = 2,7-bis(fluoro-di(2-pyridyl)methyl)-1,8-naphthyridine; X = BAr4(-) and NTf2(-); Tf = SO2CF3) was achieved by treatment of a dicopper complex [Cu2(μ-η(1):η(1)-NCCH3)DPFN]X2 (X = PF6(-) and NTf2(-)) with tetraarylborates. Structural characterization revealed symmetrically bridging aryl groups, and (1)H NMR spectroscopy evidenced the same structure in solution at 24 °C. Electrochemical investigation of the resulting arylcopper complexes uncovered reversible redox events that led to the synthesis and isolation of a rare mixed-valence organocopper complex [Cu2(μ-η(1):η(1)-Ph)DPFN](NTf2)2 in high yield. The solid-state structure of the mixed-valence μ-phenyl complex exhibits inequivalent copper centers, despite a short Cu···Cu distance. Electronic and variable-temperature electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy of the mixed-valence μ-phenyl complex suggest that the degree of spin localization is temperature-dependent, with a high degree of spin localization observed at lower temperatures. Electronic structure calculations agree with the experimental results and suggest that the spin is localized almost entirely on one metal center.	0
Title: Bacteriophage T4D receptor and the Escherichia coli cell wall structure: binding of endotoxin-like particles to the cell wall Abstract: A variety of degradative treatments have been used to investigate the nature of the structure and components of the cell walls of Escherichia coli B. The binding and localization of the endotoxin-like particles found on the cell walls were of special interest because some of them are associated with the site where the inner tail tube of bacteriophage T4D penetrates the cell wall. Modified cell walls were obtained by heating a suspension of bacterial cells originally in 0.1 M phosphate, pH 7.0, after the addition of 12.5 M NaOH to a final concentration of 0.25 M. With regard to the endotoxin-like particles, it was found that: (i) at least part of them still remained bound to the modified cell wall after the alkali treatment; (ii) the subsequent incubation of alkali-treated cell walls with lysozyme destroyed the bacterial form and released a complex of endotoxin-like particles together with a fibrous material; (iii) on the other hand, treatment with 45% phenol at 70 degrees C removed the endotoxin-like particles from the surface of the alkali-treated cell walls, but most of the fibrous material was left on the cell wall; and (iv) incubation of alkali-treated cell walls with 5 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid at 20 degrees C also removed the endotoxin-like particles, but did not disrupt the rodlike bacterial form. However, if the ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid treatment was performed at 55 degrees C, the bacterium-like form was destroyed. These differential sensitivities to ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid suggested that loosely bound divalent metal ions normally hold these endotoxin-like particles on the cell wall surface, but that probably more tightly bound metal ions are involved in the determination of cell shape. Analysis of the protein components of the alkalitreated cell walls showed that only one protein was present in significant amounts, and this protein had an electrophoretic mobility similar to that of the Braun lipoprotein. This protein was released from the alkali-treated cell walls upon heating with 2% sodium dodecyl sulfate at 100 degrees C. Phospholipids were also absent from this structure. The distribution of the remaining cell wall components on the alkali-treated cell walls is discussed.	0
Title: Coral Carbonic Anhydrases: Regulation by Ocean Acidification Abstract: Global change is a major threat to the oceans, as it implies temperature increase and acidification. Ocean acidification (OA) involving decreasing pH and changes in seawater carbonate chemistry challenges the capacity of corals to form their skeletons. Despite the large number of studies that have investigated how rates of calcification respond to ocean acidification scenarios, comparatively few studies tackle how ocean acidification impacts the physiological mechanisms that drive calcification itself. The aim of our paper was to determine how the carbonic anhydrases, which play a major role in calcification, are potentially regulated by ocean acidification. For this we measured the effect of pH on enzyme activity of two carbonic anhydrase isoforms that have been previously characterized in the scleractinian coral Stylophora pistillata. In addition we looked at gene expression of these enzymes in vivo. For both isoforms, our results show (1) a change in gene expression under OA (2) an effect of OA and temperature on carbonic anhydrase activity. We suggest that temperature increase could counterbalance the effect of OA on enzyme activity. Finally we point out that caution must, thus, be taken when interpreting transcriptomic data on carbonic anhydrases in ocean acidification and temperature stress experiments, as the effect of these stressors on the physiological function of CA will depend both on gene expression and enzyme activity.	0
Title: The adenovirus-mediated transfer of PTEN inhibits the growth of esophageal cancer cells in vitro and in vivo Abstract: The development and progression of esophageal cancer is associated with multiple alterations in the genome, including loss of the tumor suppressor phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted from the chromosome 10 (PTEN) gene. The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of adenovirus-mediated MMAC/PTEN expression on the growth and survival of human esophageal cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. We found that compared to control cells, overexpression of PTEN significantly suppressed growth and induced apoptosis in esophageal cancer cell lines Eca-109 and TE-1 via downregulation of Bcl-2 expression and changes in cell-cycle progression. Adenovirus PTEN also inhibited the growth of subcutaneous tumor xenografts by significantly reducing tumor size in vivo. Thus our results confirm the proposed functional role of MMAC/PTEN as a regulator of esophageal cancer progression in vivo and in vitro. PTEN might be an important biological marker and potential therapeutic target in the treatment of human esophageal cancer.	0
Title: The biosynthetic gene cluster for the beta-lactam carbapenem thienamycin in Streptomyces cattleya Abstract: beta-lactam ring formation in carbapenem and clavam biosynthesis proceeds through an alternative mechanism to the biosynthetic pathway of classic beta-lactam antibiotics. This involves the participation of a beta-lactam synthetase. Using available information from beta-lactam synthetases, we generated a probe for the isolation of the thienamycin cluster from Streptomyces cattleya. Genes homologous to carbapenem and clavulanic acid biosynthetic genes have been identified. They would participate in early steps of thienamycin biosynthesis leading to the formation of the beta-lactam ring. Other genes necessary for the biosynthesis of thienamycin have also been identified in the cluster (methyltransferases, cysteinyl transferases, oxidoreductases, hydroxylase, etc.) together with two regulatory genes, genes involved in exportation and/or resistance, and a quorum sensing system. Involvement of the cluster in thienamycin biosynthesis was demonstrated by insertional inactivation of several genes generating thienamycin nonproducing mutants.	1
Title: Histone Tail Sequences Balance Their Role in Genetic Regulation and the Need To Protect DNA against Destruction in Nucleosome Core Particles Containing Abasic Sites Abstract: Abasic sites (AP) are produced 10 000 times per day in a single cell. Strand cleavage at AP is accelerated ≈100-fold within a nucleosome core particle (NCP) compared to free DNA. The lysine-rich N-terminal tails of histone proteins catalyze single-strand breaks through a mechanism used by base-excision-repair enzymes, despite the general dearth of glutamic acid, aspartic acid, and histidine-the amino acids that are typically responsible for deprotonation of Schiff base intermediates. Incorporating glutamic acid, aspartic acid, or histidine proximal to lysine residues in histone N-terminal tails increases AP reactivity as much as sixfold. The rate acceleration is due to more facile DNA cleavage of Schiff-base intermediates. These observations raise the possibility that histone proteins could have evolved to minimize the presence of histidine, glutamic acid, and aspartic acid in their lysine-rich N-terminal tails to guard against enhancing the toxic effects of DNA damage.	0
Title: Draft Genome Sequence of Amycolatopsis decaplanina Strain DSM 44594T Abstract: We report the 8.5-Mb genome sequence of Amycolatopsis decaplanina strain DSM 44594(T), isolated from a soil sample from India. The draft genome of strain DSM 44594(T) consists of 8,533,276 bp with a 68.6% G+C content, 7,899 protein-coding genes, and 57 RNAs.	1
Title: The principal neutralizing determinant of HIV-1 located in V3 of gp120 forms a 12-residue loop by internal hydrophobic interactions Abstract: The interactions of the peptide RP135a (RKSI-RIQRGPGRAFVT), corresponding to residues 311-326 of gp120 of HIV-1IIIB, with the anti-gp120 HIV-1IIIB neutralizing antibody 0.5 beta were studied by NMR. The NOESY difference spectra measured using specifically deuterated derivatives of the peptide show exclusively the interactions of the deuterated residues both within the bound peptide and with the Fab fragment of the antibody. These measurements reveal hydrophobic interactions within the bound peptide between Ile-4, Ile-6 and Val-15 that create a 12-residue loop with these residues at the base and the conserved GPGR sequence at its top.	0
Title: Pseudomonas Cyclic Lipopeptides Suppress the Rice Blast Fungus Magnaporthe oryzae by Induced Resistance and Direct Antagonism Abstract: Beneficial Pseudomonas spp. produce an array of antimicrobial secondary metabolites such as cyclic lipopeptides (CLPs). We investigated the capacity of CLP-producing Pseudomonas strains and their crude CLP extracts to control rice blast caused by Magnaporthe oryzae, both in a direct manner and via induced systemic resistance (ISR). In planta biocontrol assays showed that lokisin-, white line inducing principle (WLIP)-, entolysin- and N3-producing strains successfully induced resistance to M. oryzae VT5M1. Furthermore, crude extracts of lokisin, WLIP and entolysin gave similar ISR results when tested in planta. In contrast, a xantholysin-producing strain and crude extracts of N3, xantholysin and orfamide did not induce resistance against the rice blast disease. The role of WLIP in triggering ISR was further confirmed by using WLIP-deficient mutants. The severity of rice blast disease was significantly reduced when M. oryzae spores were pre-treated with crude extracts of N3, lokisin, WLIP, entolysin or orfamide prior to inoculation. In vitro microscopic assays further revealed the capacity of crude N3, lokisin, WLIP, entolysin, xantholysin and orfamide to significantly inhibit appressoria formation by M. oryzae. In addition, the lokisin and WLIP biosynthetic gene clusters in the producing strains are described. In short, our study demonstrates the biological activity of structurally diverse CLPs in the control of the rice blast disease caused by M. oryzae. Furthermore, we provide insight into the non-ribosomal peptide synthetase genes encoding the WLIP and lokisin biosynthetic machineries.	1
Title: Degradation of mutant influenza virus hemagglutinins is influenced by cytoplasmic sequences independent of internalization signals Abstract: A mutant influenza virus hemagglutinin, HA+8, having a carboxyl-terminal extension of 8 amino acids that included 4 aromatic residues, was internalized within 2 min of arriving at the cell surface and was degraded quickly by a process that was inhibited by ammonium chloride. Through second-site mutagenesis, the internalization sequence of HA+8 was found to closely resemble the internalization signals of the transferrin receptor or large mannose 6-phosphate receptor. Comparison of the intracellular traffic of HA+8 and a series of other HA mutants that differed in their rates of internalization revealed a relation between the amount of the protein on the plasma membrane at steady state and the internalization rate that would be predicted if most of each protein recycled to the cell surface. However, there was no simple correlation between the internalization rate and the rate of degradation, indicating that transport to the compartment where degradation occurred was not simply a function of the concentration of the proteins in early endosomes. The internal populations of both HA+8, which was degraded with a t1/2 of 1.9 h, and HA-Y543, which was degraded with a t1/2 of 2.9 h, were found by cell fractionation and density-shift experiments to reside in early endosomes with little accumulation in lysosomes. A fluid-phase marker reached lysosomes 3-4-fold faster than these proteins were degraded. Degradation of these mutant HAs involved a rate-determining step in early endosomes that was sensitive to some feature of the protein that depended upon sequence differences in the cytoplasmic domain unrelated to the internalization signal.	0
Title: Cloning and physical mapping of the EcoRI fragments of the giant linear plasmid SCP1 Abstract: A cosmid library was constructed for the 350-kb giant linear plasmid SCP1 and aligned on a successive linear map. Only a 0.8-kb gap has remained uncloned in the terminal inverted repeats close to both ends. Partial digestion of the aligned cosmids with EcoRI and hybridization with the flanking fragments of the vector enabled physical mapping of all of the EcoRI fragments. On this map, the methylenomycin biosynthetic gene cluster, the insertion sequence IS466, and the sapCDE genes coding for spore-associated proteins were localized.	1
Title: The evolution of three siderophore biosynthetic clusters in environmental and host-associating strains of Pantoea Abstract: For many pathogenic members of the Enterobacterales, siderophores play an important role in virulence, yet the siderophores of the host-associating members of the genus Pantoea remain unexplored. We conducted a genome-wide survey of environmental and host-associating strains of Pantoea to identify known and candidate siderophore biosynthetic clusters. Our analysis identified three clusters homologous to those of enterobactin, desferrioxamine, and aerobactin that were prevalent among Pantoea species. Using both phylogenetic and comparative genomic approaches, we demonstrate that the enterobactin-like cluster was present in the common ancestor of all Pantoea, with evidence for three independent losses of the cluster in P. eucalypti, P. eucrina, and the P. ananatis-P. stewartii lineage. The desferrioxamine biosynthetic cluster, previously described and characterized in Pantoea, was horizontally acquired from its close relative Erwinia, with phylogenetic evidence that these transfer events were ancient and occurred between ancestral lineages. The aerobactin cluster was identified in three host-associating species groups, P. septica, P. ananatis, and P. stewartii, with strong evidence for horizontal acquisition from human-pathogenic members of the Enterobacterales. Our work identifies and describes the key siderophore clusters in Pantoea, shows three distinct evolutionary processes driving their diversification, and provides a foundation for exploring the roles that these siderophores may play in human opportunistic infections.	1
Title: Sequence-independent processing site of the C-terminal domain (CTD) influences maturation of the RgpB protease from Porphyromonas gingivalis Abstract: The Gram-negative periodontal pathogen Porphyromonas gingivalis produces a family of outer membrane-anchored proteases, the gingipains, shown to play an essential role in virulence of the organism. The C-terminal domain (CTD) of gingipains and other secreted proteins is known to be the targeting signal for maturation and translocation of the protein through the outer membrane. The CTD is subsequently cleaved during the secretion process. Multiple alignment of various CTDs failed to define a consensus sequence at the putative CTD processing site. Using mutagenesis, we were able to show that cleavage at the site is not dependent on a specific residue and that recognition of the site is independent of local sequence. Interestingly, length of the junction between the CTD and adjacent Ig-like subdomain has a critical influence on post-translational glycan modification of the protein, whereby insertion of additional residues immediately N-terminal to the cleavage site results in failure of glycan modification and release of soluble protease into the culture medium. Various hypotheses are presented to explain these phenomena. Knowledge of the role CTDs play in maturation of gingipains has broader application for understanding maturation of CTD homologues expressed by bacteria of the Bacteriodetes phylum.	0
Title: Isolation and characterization of the tobramycin biosynthetic gene cluster from Streptomyces tenebrarius Abstract: The biosynthetic gene cluster for tobramycin, a 2-deoxystreptamine-containing aminoglycoside antibiotic, was isolated from Streptomyces tenebrarius ATCC 17920. A genomic library of S. tenebrarius was constructed, and a cosmid, pST51, was isolated by the probes based on the core regions of 2-deoxy-scyllo-inosose (DOI) synthase, and L-glutamine:DOI aminotransferase and L-glutamine:scyllo-inosose aminotransferase. Sequencing of 33.9 kb revealed 24 open reading frames (ORFs) including putative tobramycin biosynthetic genes. We demonstrated that one of these ORFs, tbmA, encodes DOI synthase by in vitro enzyme assay of the purified protein. The catalytic residues of TbmA and dehydroquinate synthase were studied by homology modeling. The gene cluster found is likely to be involved in the biosynthesis of tobramycin.	1
Title: Camporidines A and B: Antimetastatic and Anti-inflammatory Polyketide Alkaloids from a Gut Bacterium of Camponotus kiusiuensis Abstract: Chemical studies of gut bacteria of the carpenter ant Camponotus kiusiuensis led to the discovery of two new alkaloids, camporidines A and B (1 and 2), from Streptomyces sp. STA1. The structures of 1 and 2 were established as new polyketide alkaloids bearing a piperidine-cyclopentene-epoxide 6/5/3 tricyclic system based on NMR spectroscopic and mass spectrometric analysis. The relative configurations of the camporidines were determined by their 1H-1H NOESY/ROESY and 1D NOE NMR correlations. The experimental ECD spectra of 1 and 2 were compared with their calculated ECD spectra to assign their absolute configurations. Camporidine A (1) displayed antimetastatic activity by suppression of cell invasion against the metastatic breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 and showed an anti-inflammatory effect by suppressing nitric oxide production induced by lipopolysaccharide. In addition, the putative biosynthetic gene cluster of the camporidines was identified, and the biosynthetic pathway of the camporidines was proposed based on bioinformatic analysis of the full genome of Streptomyces sp. STA1. Camporidines A and B (1 and 2) could be biosynthesized by a modular type I PKS containing an acyl transferase domain that accepts an unusual extender unit, which becomes the (C1'-C6') hexyl side chain. The post-PKS modification enzymes were predicted to perform an amination and an oxidation along with spontaneous Schiff base formation and generate the unique piperidine-cyclopentene-epoxide 6/5/3 tricyclic framework.	1
Title: Coupling of the biosynthesis and export of the DNA gyrase inhibitor simocyclinone in Streptomyces antibioticus Abstract: Because most antibiotics are potentially lethal to the producing organism, there must be mechanisms to ensure that the machinery responsible for export of the mature antibiotic is in place at the time of biosynthesis. Simocyclinone D8 is a potent DNA gyrase inhibitor produced by Streptomyces antibioticus Tü 6040. Within the simocyclinone biosynthetic cluster are two divergently transcribed genes, simR and simX, encoding proteins that resemble the TetR/TetA repressor-efflux pump pair that cause widespread resistance to clinically important tetracyclines. Engineered expression of simX from a strong, heterologous promoter conferred high level simocyclinone D8 resistance on Streptomyces lividans, showing that simX encodes a simocyclinone efflux pump. Transcription of simX is controlled by SimR, which directly represses the simX and simR promoters by binding to two operator sites in the simX-simR intergenic region. Simocyclinone D8 abolishes DNA binding by SimR, providing a mechanism that couples the biosynthesis of simocyclinone to its export. In addition, an intermediate in the biosynthetic pathway, simocyclinone C4, which is essentially inactive as a DNA gyrase inhibitor, also induces simX expression in vivo and relieves simX repression by SimR in vitro.	1
Title: Target-based screen against a periplasmic serine protease that regulates intrabacterial pH homeostasis in Mycobacterium tuberculosis Abstract: Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) maintains its intrabacterial pH (pHIB) near neutrality in the acidic environment of phagosomes within activated macrophages. A previously reported genetic screen revealed that Mtb loses this ability when the mycobacterial acid resistance protease (marP) gene is disrupted. In the present study, a high throughput screen (HTS) of compounds against the protease domain of MarP identified benzoxazinones as inhibitors of MarP. A potent benzoxazinone, BO43 (6-chloro-2-(2'-methylphenyl)-4H-1,3-benzoxazin-4-one), acylated MarP and lowered Mtb's pHIB and survival during incubation at pH 4.5. BO43 had similar effects on MarP-deficient Mtb, suggesting the existence of additional target(s). Reaction of an alkynyl-benzoxazinone, BO43T, with Mycobacterium bovis variant bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) followed by click chemistry with azido-biotin identified both the MarP homologue and the high temperature requirement A1 (HtrA1) homologue, an essential protein. Thus, the chemical probe identified through a target-based screen not only reacted with its intended target in the intact cells but also implicated an additional enzyme that had eluded a genetic screen biased against essential genes.	0
Title: Migrastatin and a new compound, isomigrastatin, from Streptomyces platensis Abstract: Streptomyces platensis (strain NRRL 18993), a producer of dorrigocins, was shown to produce migrastatin, a cyclic congener of dorrigocin A previously reported from a different organism. Additionally a new compound isomeric to migrastatin, isomigrastatin, was also isolated and its structure was determined to be a cyclic form of dorrigocin B. Both compounds were fully characterized from MS and NMR data. Product titers of both were improved by the addition of XAD-16 resin to the fermentation medium.	1
Title: Biosynthesis of Heptacyclic Duclauxins Requires Extensive Redox Modifications of the Phenalenone Aromatic Polyketide Abstract: Duclauxins are dimeric and heptacyclic fungal polyketides with notable bioactivities. We characterized the cascade of redox transformations in the biosynthetic pathway of duclauxin from Talaromyces stipitatus. The redox reaction sequence is initiated by a cupin family dioxygenase DuxM that performs an oxidative cleavage of the peri-fused tricyclic phenalenone and affords a transient hemiketal-oxaphenalenone intermediate. Additional redox enzymes then morph the oxaphenoalenone into either an anhydride or a dihydrocoumarin-containing monomeric building block that is found in dimeric duxlauxins. Oxidative coupling between the monomers to form the initial C-C bond was shown to be catalyzed by a P450 monooxygenase, although the enzyme responsible for the second C-C bond formation was not found in the pathway. Collectively, the number and variety of redox enzymes used in the duclauxin pathway showcase Nature's strategy to generate structural complexity during natural product biosynthesis.	1
Title: Efficient biosynthesis of nucleoside cytokinin angustmycin A containing an unusual sugar system Abstract: Angustmycin A has anti-mycobacterial and cytokinin activities, and contains an intriguing structure in which an unusual sugar with C5'-C6' dehydration is linked to adenine via an N-glycosidic bond. However, the logic underlying the biosynthesis of this molecule has long remained obscure. Here, we address angustmycin A biosynthesis by the full deciphering of its pathway. We demonstrate that AgmD, C, A, E, and B function as D-allulose 6-phosphate 3-epimerase, D-allulose 6-phosphate pyrophosphokinase, adenine phosphoallulosyltransferase, phosphoribohydrolase, and phosphatase, respectively, and that these collaboratively catalyze the relay reactions to biosynthesize angustmycin C. Additionally, we provide evidence that AgmF is a noncanonical dehydratase for the final step to angustmycin A via a self-sufficient strategy for cofactor recycling. Finally, we have reconstituted the entire six-enzyme pathway in vitro and in E. coli leading to angustmycin A production. These results expand the enzymatic repertoire regarding natural product biosynthesis, and also open the way for rational and rapid discovery of other angustmycin related antibiotics.	1
Title: Canthaxanthin biosynthesis by the conversion of methylene to keto groups in a hydrocarbon beta-carotene by a single gene Abstract: Compounds that include (a) keto group(s) in a molecule are ubiquitous natural components. A novel gene involved in ketocompound biosynthesis, designated crtW, was isolated from the marine bacteria Agrobacterium aurantiacum and Alcaligenes PC-1 that produce ketocarotenoids such as astaxanthin. When this gene was introduced into Escherichia coli that accumulated beta-carotene due to the Erwinia carotenogenic genes, the E. coli transformants synthesized canthaxanthin, one of ketocarotenoids, which was identified after purification by its visible, FD-MS and 1H-NMR spectral analysis. It has been demonstrated for the first time that one gene encodes an enzyme "ketolase" that catalyzes the conversion of methylene groups of a hydrocarbon beta-carotene to keto groups for synthesizing canthaxanthin via echinenone.	1
Title: Cofactor recycling for selective enzymatic biotransformation of cinnamaldehyde to cinnamyl alcohol Abstract: The enzymatic, selective hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde to cinnamyl alcohol is reported here. Yeast alcohol dehydrogenase was used in a substrate-coupled process with cofactor recycling. Both 100% selectivity and aldehyde conversion were achieved within 3 h. The reaction took place under very mild conditions, in the absence of toxic organic solvent. The overall process proved inexpensive and deserves further optimization studies in order to evaluate industrial applications.	0

Title: Unified Biosynthetic Origin of the Benzodipyrrole Subunits in CC-1065 Abstract: CC-1065 is the first characterized member of a family of naturally occurring antibiotics including yatakemycin and duocarmycins with exceptionally potent antitumor activity. CC-1065 contains three benzodipyrroles (1a-, 1b-, and 1c-) of which the 1a-subunit is remarkable by being composed of a cyclopropane ring, and the mechanism for the biological formation of benzodipyrrole rings remains elusive. Previously, biosynthetic studies of CC-1065 were limited to radioactively labeled precursor feeding experiments, which showed that tyrosine (Tyr) and serine (Ser) were incorporated into the two benzodipyrrole (1b- and 1c-) subunits via the same mode but that this was different from the key cyclopropabenzodipyrrole (1a-) subunit with N1-C2-C3 derived from Ser. Herein, the biosynthetic gene cluster of CC-1065 has been cloned, analyzed, and characterized by a series of gene inactivations. Significantly, a key intermediate bearing a C7-OH group derived from a Δc10C mutant exhibited improved cytotoxicity. Moreover, this data inspired us to suspect that the 1a-subunit might employ the same precursor incorporation mode as the 1b- and 1c-subunits. Subsequently, 13C-labeled Tyr feeding experiments confirmed that the N1-C2-C3 is originated from Tyr via DOPA as an intermediate. Collectively, a biosynthetic pathway of benzodipyrrole is proposed featuring a revised and unified precursor incorporation mode, which implicates an oxidative cyclization strategy for the assembly of benzodipyrrole. This work sets the stage for further study of enzymatic mechanisms and combinatorial biosynthesis for new DNA alkylating analogues.	1
Title: Knocking out of tailoring genes eryK and eryG in an industrial erythromycin-producing strain of Saccharopolyspora erythraea leading to overproduction of erythromycin B, C and D at different conversion ratios Abstract: Aims:                        To overproduce erythromycin C, B or D and evaluate the effect of disruption of tailoring genes eryK and eryG in an industrial erythromycin producer.                  Methods and results:                        The tailoring genes eryG and eryK were inactivated individually or simultaneously by targeted gene disruption in an industrial strain Saccharopolyspora erythraea HL3168 E3, resulting in the overproduction of erythromycin C (2·48 g l(-1) ), B (1·70 g l(-1) ) or D (2·15 g l(-1) ) in the mutant strain QL-G, QL-K or QL-KG, respectively. Analysis of the erythromycin congeners throughout the fermentation indicated that, at the end of fermentation, comparatively large amount of erythromycin D (0·67 g l(-1) ) was accumulated in QL-G, whereas only small amount of erythromycin D (0·10 g l(-1) ) was produced in QL-K.                  Conclusions:                       Inactivation of tailoring genes eryG and eryK in the high producer did not affect the biosynthesis of erythromycin. However, erythromycin D could be more efficiently methylated by EryG than be hydroxylated by EryK.                  Significance and impact of the study:                       Development of the mutant strains provides a method for the economical large-scale production of potent lead compounds. The information about the accumulation and conversion of erythromycins in the industrial strains may contribute to further improving erythromycin production.	1
Title: Chromosomal replication origin from the marine bacterium Vibrio harveyi functions in Escherichia coli: oriC consensus sequence Abstract: The chromosomal replication origin (oriC) of Vibrio harveyi has been isolated on a plasmid and shown to function as an origin in Escherichia coli. The nucleotide sequence of the V. harveyi oriC was determined. From a comparison of this sequence with oriC sequences of five enteric bacteria, we derived a consensus sequence of bacterial origins that function in E. coli. This consensus sequence identifies 122 positions within oriC where nucleotide substitutions can occur without loss of origin function. These positions are clustered rather than scattered. Four interrelated nine-base-pair repeats and eight of the dam methylation G-A-T-C sites are conserved in the consensus sequence. Very few relative insertion-deletion changes occur, and these are localized to one region of oriC. The genes for three polypeptides linked to the V. harveyi oriC were identified by using in vitro protein synthesis directed by deletion derivative plasmid templates. One of these genes, coding for a 58,000 Mr polypeptide and located 3.0 kilobase pairs from the V. harveyi oriC region, is lethal to E. coli when many copies (approximately 40 per cell) are present (high copy lethal or HCL gene). In addition, nucleotide sequence analysis showed that a different gene, the gid gene to the left of oriC, is highly conserved between E. coli and V. harveyi, whereas the coding region to the right of oriC is much less conserved.	0
Title: The promoter architectural landscape of the Salmonella PhoP regulon Abstract: The DNA-binding protein PhoP controls virulence and Mg²⁺ homeostasis in the Gram-negative pathogen Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium. PhoP regulates expression of a large number of genes that differ both in their ancestry and in the biochemical functions and physiological roles of the encoded products. This suggests that PhoP-regulated genes are differentially expressed. To understand how a bacterial activator might generate varied gene expression behaviour, we investigated the cis-acting promoter features (i.e. the number of PhoP binding sites, as well as their orientation and location with respect to the sites bound by RNA polymerase and the sequences that constitute the PhoP binding sites) in 23 PhoP-activated promoters. Our results show that natural PhoP-activated promoters utilize only a limited number of combinations of cis-acting features--or promoter architectures. We determine that PhoP activates transcription by different mechanisms, and that ancestral and horizontally acquired PhoP-activated genes have distinct promoter architectures.	0
Title: Towards continuous industrial bioprocessing with solventogenic and acetogenic clostridia: challenges, progress and perspectives Abstract: The sustainable production of solvents from above ground carbon is highly desired. Several clostridia naturally produce solvents and use a variety of renewable and waste-derived substrates such as lignocellulosic biomass and gas mixtures containing H2/CO2 or CO. To enable economically viable production of solvents and biofuels such as ethanol and butanol, the high productivity of continuous bioprocesses is needed. While the first industrial-scale gas fermentation facility operates continuously, the acetone-butanol-ethanol (ABE) fermentation is traditionally operated in batch mode. This review highlights the benefits of continuous bioprocessing for solvent production and underlines the progress made towards its establishment. Based on metabolic capabilities of solvent producing clostridia, we discuss recent advances in systems-level understanding and genome engineering. On the process side, we focus on innovative fermentation methods and integrated product recovery to overcome the limitations of the classical one-stage chemostat and give an overview of the current industrial bioproduction of solvents.	0
Title: Effect of SDS on release of intracellular pneumocandin B0 in extractive batch fermentation of Glarea lozoyensis Abstract: Pneumocandin B0 is a hydrophobic secondary metabolite that accumulates in the mycelia of Glarea lozoyensis and inhibits fungal 1,3-β-glucan synthase. Extractive batch fermentation can promote the release of intracellular secondary metabolites into the fermentation broth and is often used in industry. The addition of extractants has been proven as an effective method to attain higher accumulation of hydrophobic secondary metabolites and circumvent troublesome solvent extraction. Various extractants exerted significant but different influences on the biomass and pneumocandin B0 yields. The maximum pneumocandin B0 yield (2528.67 mg/L) and highest extracellular pneumocandin B0 yield (580.33 mg/L) were achieved when 1.0 g/L SDS was added on the 13th day of extractive batch fermentation, corresponding to significant increases of 37.63 and 154% compared with the conventional batch fermentation, respectively. The mechanism behind this phenomenon is partly attributed to the release of intracellular pneumocandin B0 into the fermentation broth and the enhanced biosynthesis of pneumocandin B0 in the mycelia.	0
Title: Alpha-lactosylceramide as a novel "sugar-capped" CD1d ligand for natural killer T cells: biased cytokine profile and therapeutic activities Abstract: The invariant natural killer T cells (iNKT) cells have emerged as an important regulator of immunity to infection, cancer, and autoimmune diseases. They can be activated by glycolipids that bind to CD1d. The most effective iNKT ligand reported to date is alpha-galactosylceramide (alpha-GalCer), which stimulates iNKT cells to secrete both Th-1 and Th-2 cytokines. Indiscriminate induction of both types of cytokines could limit the therapeutic potential of iNKT ligands, as Th-1 and Th-2 cytokines play different roles under physiological and pathological conditions. Therefore, a ligand with a biased cytokine-release profile would be highly desirable. Here, we report the synthesis and biological activity of alpha-lactosylceramide (alpha-LacCer). Our data demonstrate that alpha-LacCer can stimulate iNKT cells to proliferate and release cytokines, both in vitro and in vivo. Interestingly, while alpha-LacCer is approximately 1000-times less efficient than alpha-GalCer in inducing Th-1 cytokines, it is as potent as alpha-GalCer in the induction of Th-2 cytokines; therefore, alpha-LacCer is a novel compound that induces a biased cytokine release. Processing by beta-glycosidase was critical for alpha-LacCer activity. Moreover, in vivo experiments suggest that alpha-LacCer is at least as potent as alpha-GalCer in the treatment of tumors and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis.	0
Title: Alternative folding to a monomer or homopolymer is a common feature of the type 1 pilus subunit FimA from enteroinvasive bacteria Abstract: Adhesive type 1 pili from enteroinvasive, Gram-negative bacteria mediate attachment to host cells. Up to 3000 copies of the main pilus subunit, FimA, assemble into the filamentous, helical quaternary structure of the pilus rod via a mechanism termed donor-strand complementation, in which the N-terminal extension of each subunit, the donor strand, is inserted into the incomplete immunoglobulin-like fold of the preceding FimA subunit. For FimA from Escherichia coli, it has been previously shown that the protein can also adopt a monomeric, self-complemented conformation in which the donor strand is inserted intramolecularly in the opposite orientation relative to that observed for FimA polymers. Notably, soluble FimA monomers can act as apoptosis inhibitors in epithelial cells after uptake of type 1-piliated pathogens. Here, we show that the FimA orthologues from Escherichia coli, Shigella flexneri, and Salmonella enterica can all fold to form self-complemented monomers. We solved X-ray structures of all three FimA monomers at 0.89-1.69 Å resolutions, revealing identical, intramolecular donor-strand complementation mechanisms. Our results also showed that the pseudo-palindromic sequences of the donor strands in all FimA proteins permit their alternative folding possibilities. All FimA monomers proved to be 50-60 kJ/mol less stable against unfolding than their pilus rod-like counterparts (which exhibited very high energy barriers of unfolding and refolding). We conclude that the ability of FimA to adopt an alternative, monomeric state with anti-apoptotic activity is a general feature of FimA proteins of type 1-piliated bacteria.	0
Title: Traceless parallel peptide purification by a first-in-class reductively cleavable linker system featuring a safety-release Abstract: Hundreds of peptides can be synthesized by automated parallel synthesizers in a single run. In contrast, the most widely used peptide purification method - high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) - only allows one-by-one processing of each sample. The chromatographic purification of many peptides, therefore, remains a time-consuming and costly effort. Catch-and-release methods can be processed in parallel and potentially provide a remedy. However, no such system has yet provided a true alternative to HPLC. Herein we present the development of a side-reaction free, reductively cleavable linker. The linker is added to the target peptide as the last building block during peptide synthesis. After acidic cleavage from synthetic resin, the linker-tagged full-length peptide is caught onto an aldehyde-modified solid support by rapid oxime ligation, allowing removal of all impurities lacking the linker by washing. Reducing the aryl azide to an aniline sensitizes the linker for cleavage. However, scission does not occur at non-acidic pH enabling wash out of reducing agent. Final acidic treatment safely liberates the peptide by an acid-catalysed 1,6-elimination. We showcase this first-in-class reductively cleavable linker system in the parallel purification of a personalized neoantigen cocktail, containing 20 peptides for cancer immunotherapy within six hours.	0
Title: Isolation and characterization of NaCl-sensitive mutants of Caulobacter crescentus Abstract: An attempt to characterize Caulobacter crescentus genes important for the response to high concentrations of NaCl was initiated by the isolation of mutants defective in survival in the presence of 85 mM NaCl. A transposon Tn5 library was screened, and five strains which contained different genes disrupted by the transposon were isolated. Three of the mutants had the Tn5 in genes involved in lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis, one had the Tn5 in the nhaA gene, which encodes a Na(+)/H(+) antiporter, and one had the Tn5 in the ppiD gene, which encodes a peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase. All the mutant strains showed severe growth arrest in the presence of 85 mM NaCl, but only the nhaA mutant showed decreased viability under these conditions. All the mutants except the nhaA mutant showed a slightly reduced viability in the presence of 40 mM KCl, but all the strains showed a more severe reduction in viability in the presence of 150 mM sucrose, suggesting that they are defective in responding to osmotic shock. The promoter regions of each disrupted gene were cloned in lacZ reporter vectors, and the pattern of expression in response to NaCl and sucrose was determined; this showed that both agents induced ppiD and nhaA gene expression but did not induce the other genes. Furthermore, the ppiD gene was not induced by heat shock, indicating that it does not belong to the sigma(32) regulon, as opposed to what was observed for its Escherichia coli homolog.	0
Title: Redundant synthesis of a conidial polyketide by two distinct secondary metabolite clusters in Aspergillus fumigatus Abstract: Filamentous fungi are renowned for the production of bioactive secondary metabolites. Typically, one distinct metabolite is generated from a specific secondary metabolite cluster. Here, we characterize the newly described trypacidin (tpc) cluster in the opportunistic human pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus. We find that this cluster as well as the previously characterized endocrocin (enc) cluster both contribute to the production of the spore metabolite endocrocin. Whereas trypacidin is eliminated when only tpc cluster genes are deleted, endocrocin production is only eliminated when both the tpc and enc non-reducing polyketide synthase-encoding genes, tpcC and encA, respectively, are deleted. EncC, an anthrone oxidase, converts the product released from EncA to endocrocin as a final product. In contrast, endocrocin synthesis by the tpc cluster likely results from incomplete catalysis by TpcK (a putative decarboxylase), as its deletion results in a nearly 10-fold increase in endocrocin production. We suggest endocrocin is likely a shunt product in all related non-reducing polyketide synthase clusters containing homologues of TpcK and TpcL (a putative anthrone oxidase), e.g. geodin and monodictyphenone. This finding represents an unusual example of two physically discrete secondary metabolite clusters generating the same natural product in one fungal species by distinct routes.	1
Title: Nucleotide sequence, transcription and deduced function of a gene involved in polyketide antibiotic synthesis in Streptomyces coelicolor Abstract: The BamHI fragment containing the actIII gene, from the actinorhodin (Act) biosynthetic gene cluster of Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2), was sequenced. The derived amino acid sequence for the actIII gene shows homology to known oxidoreductases and the actIII product is believed to be responsible for catalysing a beta-keto reductive step during assembly of the Act polyketide chain. High resolution transcript mapping identified the transcription start point at 33 nucleotides upstream of the putative translation start codon. The transcript ends in a large invertedly repeated sequence. In vivo promoter-probe studies suggest that efficient transcription of the actIII gene requires the product of the actII gene.	1
Title: Cycloaspeptides F and G, Cyclic Pentapeptides from a Cordyceps-colonizing isolate of Isaria farinosa Abstract: Cycloaspeptides F (1) and G (2), two new cyclic pentapeptides, and the known cycloaspeptides A (3), C (4), and bisdethiodi(methylthio)hyalodendrin (5) have been isolated from the crude extract of the fungus Isaria farinosa that colonizes Cordyceps sinensis. The structures of 1 and 2 were elucidated primarily by NMR and MS methods. The absolute configuration of 1 was assigned using Marfey's method on its acid hydrolysate. Compounds 1 and 2 showed cytotoxic effects against HeLa and MCF7 cell lines, displaying the same magnitude of activity toward the MCF7 cells as the positive control 5-fluorouracil.	0
Title: Molecular Recognition in C-Type Lectins: The Cases of DC-SIGN, Langerin, MGL, and L-Sectin Abstract: Carbohydrates play a pivotal role in intercellular communication processes. In particular, glycan antigens are key for sustaining homeostasis, helping leukocytes to distinguish damaged tissues and invading pathogens from healthy tissues. From a structural perspective, this cross-talk is fairly complex, and multiple membrane proteins guide these recognition processes, including lectins and Toll-like receptors. Since the beginning of this century, lectins have become potential targets for therapeutics for controlling and/or avoiding the progression of pathologies derived from an incorrect immune outcome, including infectious processes, cancer, or autoimmune diseases. Therefore, a detailed knowledge of these receptors is mandatory for the development of specific treatments. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge about four key C-type lectins whose importance has been steadily growing in recent years, focusing in particular on how glycan recognition takes place at the molecular level, but also looking at recent progresses in the quest for therapeutics.	0
Title: Biosynthesis and Total Synthesis of Pyrronazol B: a Secondary Metabolite from Nannocystis pusilla Abstract: The first stereoselective total synthesis of the natural product pyrronazol B, which contains a chlorinated pyrrole-oxazole-pyrone framework, has been achieved. Genome sequencing of the myxobacterial producer strain Nannocystis pusilla Ari7 led to the identification of the putative biosynthetic gene cluster. The proposed biosynthetic pathway was supported by feeding experiments with stable isotopes of three biosynthetic building blocks, namely l-proline, l-serine, and l-methionine.	1

Title: Identification of the novobiocin biosynthetic gene cluster of Streptomyces spheroides NCIB 11891 Abstract: The novobiocin biosynthetic gene cluster from Streptomyces spheroides NCIB 11891 was cloned by using homologous deoxynucleoside diphosphate (dNDP)-glucose 4,6-dehydratase gene fragments as probes. Double-stranded sequencing of 25.6 kb revealed the presence of 23 putative open reading frames (ORFs), including the gene for novobiocin resistance, gyrB(r), and at least 11 further ORFs to which a possible role in novobiocin biosynthesis could be assigned. An insertional inactivation experiment with a dNDP-glucose 4, 6-dehydratase fragment resulted in abolishment of novobiocin production, since biosynthesis of the deoxysugar moiety of novobiocin was blocked. Heterologous expression of a key enzyme of novobiocin biosynthesis, i.e., novobiocic acid synthetase, in Streptomyces lividans TK24 further confirmed the involvement of the analyzed genes in the biosynthesis of the antibiotic.	1
Title: Cloning and characterization of the pyrrolomycin biosynthetic gene clusters from Actinosporangium vitaminophilum ATCC 31673 and Streptomyces sp. strain UC 11065 Abstract: The pyrrolomycins are a family of polyketide antibiotics, some of which contain a nitro group. To gain insight into the nitration mechanism associated with the formation of these antibiotics, the pyrrolomycin biosynthetic gene cluster from Actinosporangium vitaminophilum was cloned. Sequencing of ca. 56 kb of A. vitaminophilum DNA revealed 35 open reading frames (ORFs). Sequence analysis revealed a clear relationship between some of these ORFs and the biosynthetic gene cluster for pyoluteorin, a structurally related antibiotic. Since a gene transfer system could not be devised for A. vitaminophilum, additional proof for the identity of the cloned gene cluster was sought by cloning the pyrrolomycin gene cluster from Streptomyces sp. strain UC 11065, a transformable pyrrolomycin producer. Sequencing of ca. 26 kb of UC 11065 DNA revealed the presence of 17 ORFs, 15 of which exhibit strong similarity to ORFs in the A. vitaminophilum cluster as well as a nearly identical organization. Single-crossover disruption of two genes in the UC 11065 cluster abolished pyrrolomycin production in both cases. These results confirm that the genetic locus cloned from UC 11065 is essential for pyrrolomycin production, and they also confirm that the highly similar locus in A. vitaminophilum encodes pyrrolomycin biosynthetic genes. Sequence analysis revealed that both clusters contain genes encoding the two components of an assimilatory nitrate reductase. This finding suggests that nitrite is required for the formation of the nitrated pyrrolomycins. However, sequence analysis did not provide additional insights into the nitration process, suggesting the operation of a novel nitration mechanism.	1
Title: Histone modification via rapid cleavage of C4'-oxidized abasic sites in nucleosome core particles Abstract: The C4'-oxidized abasic site is produced in DNA by a variety of oxidizing agents, including potent cytotoxic antitumor agents. Independent generation of this alkali-labile lesion at defined positions within nucleosome core particles reveals that the histone proteins increase strand scission between 130- and 550-fold. Strand scission proceeds via a Schiff base intermediate, but the DNA-protein cross-links are unstable. The oxidized abasic site is removed in its entirety from the DNA and transferred to the lysine-rich tail region of the proximal histone protein in the form of a lactam. The modification is distributed over several residues within the amino-terminal tail of the proximal histone. Transfer of DNA damage to histones could affect gene regulation.	0
Title: Bipartite interactions, antibiotic production and biosynthetic potential of the Arabidopsis leaf microbiome Abstract: Plants are colonized by phylogenetically diverse microorganisms that affect plant growth and health. Representative genome-sequenced culture collections of bacterial isolates from model plants, including Arabidopsis thaliana, have recently been established. These resources provide opportunities for systematic interaction screens combined with genome mining to discover uncharacterized natural products. Here, we report on the biosynthetic potential of 224 strains isolated from the A. thaliana phyllosphere. Genome mining identified more than 1,000 predicted natural product biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs), hundreds of which are unknown compared to the MIBiG database of characterized BGCs. For functional validation, we used a high-throughput screening approach to monitor over 50,000 binary strain combinations. We observed 725 inhibitory interactions, with 26 strains contributing to the majority of these. A combination of imaging mass spectrometry and bioactivity-guided fractionation of the most potent inhibitor, the BGC-rich Brevibacillus sp. Leaf182, revealed three distinct natural product scaffolds that contribute to the observed antibiotic activity. Moreover, a genome mining-based strategy led to the isolation of a trans-acyltransferase polyketide synthase-derived antibiotic, macrobrevin, which displays an unprecedented natural product structure. Our findings demonstrate that the phyllosphere is a valuable environment for the identification of antibiotics and natural products with unusual scaffolds.	1
Title: Genetic and transcriptional analysis of the siderophore malleobactin biosynthesis and transport genes in the human pathogen Burkholderia pseudomallei K96243 Abstract: Burkholderia pseudomallei is a gram-negative facultative intracellular pathogen that causes melioidosis, an invasive disease of humans and animals. To address the response of this bacterium to iron-limiting conditions, we first performed a global transcriptional analysis of RNA extracted from bacteria grown under iron-limiting and iron-rich conditions by microarrays. We focused our study on those open reading frames (ORFs) induced under iron limitation, which encoded predicted proteins that could be involved in the biosynthesis and uptake of the siderophore malleobactin. We purified this siderophore and determined that it consisted of at least three compounds with different molecular weights. We demonstrated that ORFs BPSL1776 and BPSL1774, designated mbaA and mbaF, respectively, are involved in the biosynthesis of malleobactin, while BPSL1775, named fmtA, is involved in its transport. These genes are in an operon with two other ORFs (mbaJ and mbaI) whose transcription is under the control of MbaS, a protein that belongs to the extracytoplasmic function sigma factors. Interestingly, the transcription of the mbaA, fmtA, and mbaS genes is not controlled by the availability of the siderophore malleobactin.	1
Title: Relating protein adduction to gene expression changes: a systems approach Abstract: Modification of proteins by reactive electrophiles such as the 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (HNE) plays a critical role in oxidant-associated human diseases. However, little is known about protein adduction and the mechanism by which protein damage elicits adaptive effects and toxicity. We developed a systems approach for relating protein adduction to gene expression changes through the integration of protein adduction, gene expression, protein-DNA interaction, and protein-protein interaction data. Using a random walk strategy, we expanded a list of responsive transcription factors inferred from gene expression studies to upstream signaling networks, which in turn allowed overlaying protein adduction data on the network for the prediction of stress sensors and their associated regulatory mechanisms. We demonstrated the general applicability of transcription factor-based signaling network inference using 103 known pathways. Applying our workflow on gene expression and protein adduction data from HNE-treatment not only rediscovered known mechanisms of electrophile stress but also generated novel hypotheses regarding protein damage sensors. Although developed for analyzing protein adduction data, the framework can be easily adapted for phosphoproteomics and other types of protein modification data.	0
Title: Structural and Biosynthetic Analysis of the Fabrubactins, Unusual Siderophores from Agrobacterium fabrum Strain C58 Abstract: Siderophores are iron-chelating molecules produced by microorganisms and plants to acquire exogenous iron. Siderophore biosynthetic enzymology often produces elaborate and unique molecules through unusual reactions to enable specific recognition by the producing organisms. Herein, we report the structure of two siderophore analogs from Agrobacterium fabrum strain C58, which we named fabrubactin (FBN) A and FBN B. Additionally, we characterized the substrate specificities of the NRPS and PKS components. The structures suggest unique Favorskii-like rearrangements of the molecular backbone that we propose are catalyzed by the flavin-dependent monooxygenase, FbnE. FBN A and B contain a 1,1-dimethyl-3-amino-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-7,8-dihydroxy-quinolin (Dmaq) moiety previously seen only in the anachelin cyanobacterial siderophores. We provide evidence that Dmaq is derived from l-DOPA and propose a mechanism for the formation of the mature Dmaq moiety. Our bioinformatic analyses suggest that FBN A and B and the anachelins belong to a large and diverse siderophore family widespread throughout the Rhizobium/Agrobacterium group, α-proteobacteria, and cyanobacteria.	1
Title: Periplasmic Cytophaga hutchinsonii Endoglucanases Are Required for Use of Crystalline Cellulose as the Sole Source of Carbon and Energy Abstract: The soil bacterium Cytophaga hutchinsonii actively digests crystalline cellulose by a poorly understood mechanism. Genome analyses identified nine genes predicted to encode endoglucanases with roles in this process. No predicted cellobiohydrolases, which are usually involved in the utilization of crystalline cellulose, were identified. Chromosomal deletions were performed in eight of the endoglucanase-encoding genes: cel5A, cel5B, cel5C, cel9A, cel9B, cel9C, cel9E, and cel9F Each mutant retained the ability to digest crystalline cellulose, although the deletion of cel9C caused a modest decrease in cellulose utilization. Strains with multiple deletions were constructed to identify the critical cellulases. Cells of a mutant lacking both cel5B and cel9C were completely deficient in growth on cellulose. Cell fractionation and biochemical analyses indicate that Cel5B and Cel9C are periplasmic nonprocessive endoglucanases. The requirement of periplasmic endoglucanases for cellulose utilization suggests that cellodextrins are transported across the outer membrane during this process. Bioinformatic analyses predict that Cel5A, Cel9A, Cel9B, Cel9D, and Cel9E are secreted across the outer membrane by the type IX secretion system, which has been linked to cellulose utilization. These secreted endoglucanases may perform the initial digestion within amorphous regions on the cellulose fibers, releasing oligomers that are transported into the periplasm for further digestion by Cel5B and Cel9C. The results suggest that both cell surface and periplasmic endoglucanases are required for the growth of C. hutchinsonii on cellulose and that novel cell surface proteins may solubilize and transport cellodextrins across the outer membrane.                  Importance:                       The bacterium Cytophaga hutchinsonii digests crystalline cellulose by an unknown mechanism. It lacks processive cellobiohydrolases that are often involved in cellulose digestion. Critical cellulolytic enzymes were identified by genetic analyses. Intracellular (periplasmic) nonprocessive endoglucanases performed an important role in cellulose utilization. The results suggest a model involving partial digestion at the cell surface, solubilization and uptake of cellodextrins across the outer membrane by an unknown mechanism, and further digestion within the periplasm. The ability to sequester cellodextrins and digest them intracellularly may limit losses of soluble cellobiose to other organisms. C. hutchinsonii uses an unusual approach to digest cellulose and is a potential source of novel proteins to increase the efficiency of conversion of cellulose into soluble sugars and biofuels.	0
Title: Glycine-derived nitronates bifurcate to O-methylation or denitrification in bacteria Abstract: Natural products with rare functional groups are likely to be constructed by unique biosynthetic enzymes. One such rare functional group is the O-methyl nitronate, which can undergo [3 + 2] cycloaddition reactions with olefins in mild conditions. O-methyl nitronates are found in some natural products; however, how such O-methyl nitronates are assembled biosynthetically is unknown. Here we show that the assembly of the O-methyl nitronate in the natural product enteromycin carboxamide occurs via activation of glycine on a peptidyl carrier protein, followed by reaction with a diiron oxygenase to give a nitronate intermediate and then with a methyltransferase to give an O-methyl nitronate. Guided by the discovery of this pathway, we then identify related cryptic biosynthetic gene cassettes in other bacteria and show that these alternative gene cassettes can, instead, facilitate oxidative denitrification of glycine-derived nitronates. Altogether, our work reveals bifurcating pathways from a central glycine-derived nitronate intermediate in bacteria.	1
Title: Purification and characterization of leader (signal) peptidase from Escherichia coli Abstract: Many membrane proteins and secreted proteins are synthesized in precursor form with 15 to 30 additional NH2-terminal residues. These "leader peptides" (pre-pieces, signal peptides) are removed as these proteins cross or insert into cellular membranes. "Leader peptidase" activities which catalyze this cleavage have been detected in crude extracts and found to be dependent on membrane fractions. We now describe a 6,000-fold purification of a leader peptidase from the membranes of uninfected Escherichia coli. This leader peptidase was assayed by its ability to cleave the 23-residue leader peptide from procoat, the precursor to bacteriophage M13 coat protein. Immunoprecipitation and amino acid sequencing showed that this enzyme cleaved procoat to produce authentic coat protein. No factors other than the leader peptidase were found to be required for the conversion of procoat protein to coat protein.	0
Title: Biogenesis of Yersinia pestis PsaA in recombinant attenuated Salmonella Typhimurium vaccine (RASV) strain Abstract: Yersinia pestis PsaA is an adhesin important for the establishment of bacterial infection. PsaA synthesis requires the products of the psaEFABC genes. Here, by prediction analysis, we identified a PsaA signal sequence with two signal peptidase (SPase) cleavage sites, type-I and type-II (SPase-I and SPase-II). By Edman degradation and site-directed mutagenesis, the precise site for one of these Spase-I PsaA cleavage sites was located between alanine and serine at positions 31 and 32, respectively. Yersinia pestis psaA expression and the role of the PsaB and PsaC proteins were evaluated in recombinant attenuated Salmonella Typhimurium vaccine strains. PsaA was detected in total extracts as a major 15-kDa (mature) and 18-kDa (unprocessed) protein bands. PsaA synthesis was not altered by a DeltaA31-DeltaS32 double-deletion mutation. In contrast, the synthesis of PsaA (DeltaA31-DeltaS32) in Y. pestis and delivery to the supernatant was decreased. Otherwise, substitution of the amino acid cysteine at position 26 by valine involved in the SPase-II cleavage site did not show any effect on the secretion of PsaA in Salmonella and Yersinia. These results help clarify the secretion pathway of PsaA for the possible development of vaccines against Y. pestis.	0
Title: Cytochrome P450 as dimerization catalyst in diketopiperazine alkaloid biosynthesis Abstract: As dimeric natural products frequently exhibit useful biological activities, identifying and understanding their mechanisms of dimerization is of great interest. One such compound is (−)-ditryptophenaline, isolated from Aspergillus flavus, which inhibits substance P receptor for potential analgesic and anti-inflammatory activity. Through targeted gene knockout in A. flavus and heterologous yeast gene expression, we determined for the first time the gene cluster and pathway for the biosynthesis of a dimeric diketopiperazine alkaloid. We also determined that a single cytochrome P450, DtpC, is responsible not only for pyrroloindole ring formation but also for concurrent dimerization of N-methylphenylalanyltryptophanyl diketopiperazine monomers into a homodimeric product. Furthermore, DtpC exhibits relaxed substrate specificity, allowing the formation of two new dimeric compounds from a non-native monomeric precursor, brevianamide F. A radical-mediated mechanism of dimerization is proposed.	1
Title: Mutation of a gene encoding a putative glycoprotease leads to reduced salt tolerance, altered pigmentation, and cyanophycin accumulation in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. strain PCC 6803 Abstract: The salt-sensitive mutant 549 of the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. strain PCC 6803 was genetically and physiologically characterized. The mutated site and corresponding wild-type site were cloned and partially sequenced. The genetic analysis revealed that during the mutation about 1.8 kb was deleted from the chromosome of mutant 549. This deletion affected four open reading frames: a gcp gene homolog, the psaFJ genes, and an unknown gene. After construction of mutants with single mutations, only the gcp mutant showed a reduction in salt tolerance comparable to that of the initial mutant, indicating that the deletion of this gene was responsible for the salt sensitivity and that the other genes were of minor importance. Besides the reduced salt tolerance, a remarkable change in pigmentation was observed that became more pronounced in salt-stressed cells. The phycobilipigment content decreased, and that of carotenoids increased. Investigations of changes in the ultrastructure revealed an increase in the amount of characteristic inclusion bodies containing the high-molecular-weight nitrogen storage polymer cyanophycin (polyaspartate and arginine). The salt-induced accumulation of cyanophycin was confirmed by chemical estimations. The putative glycoprotease encoded by the gcp gene might be responsible for the degradation of cyanophycin in Synechocystis. Mutation of this gene leads to nitrogen starvation of the cells, accompanied by characteristic changes in pigmentation, ultrastructure, and salt tolerance level.	0
Title: Engineered Human Induced Pluripotent Cells Enable Genetic Code Expansion in Brain Organoids Abstract: Human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) technology has revolutionized studies on human biology. A wide range of cell types and tissue models can be derived from hiPSCs to study complex human diseases. Here, we use PiggyBac-mediated transgenesis to engineer hiPSCs with an expanded genetic code. We demonstrate that genomic integration of expression cassettes for a pyrrolysyl-tRNA synthetase (PylRS), pyrrolysyl-tRNA (PylT) and the target protein of interest enables site-specific incorporation of a non-canonical amino acid (ncAA) in response to an amber stop codon. Neural stem cells, neurons and brain organoids derived from the engineered hiPSCs continue to express the amber suppression machinery and produce ncAA-bearing reporter. The incorporated ncAA can serve as a minimal bioorthogonal handle for further modifications by labeling with fluorescent dyes. Site-directed ncAA mutagenesis will open a wide range of applications to probe and manipulate proteins in brain organoids and other hiPSC-derived cell types and complex tissue models.	0
Title: [Cloning, expression and characterization of the nucleotidylyltransferase gene-amiE in amicetin biosynthesis] Abstract: Objective:                       The aim of this study is to clone and express the nucleotidylytransferase encoding gene-amiE from the biosynthetic gene cluster of amicetin, a disaccharide nucleoside antibiotic, and to characterize AmiE in vitro.                  Methods:                       The amiE, encoding a nucleotidylytransferase of 257 amino acid, was PCR amplified and cloned into pET28a, resulting in the plasmid pCSG4001, which was transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) for expressing N-(His)6-tag AmiE. The recombinant AmiE was purified by affinity chromatography via AKTA Purifier 10 system. The AmiE-catalyzed reactions were performed using TTP (or UTP) and glucose-1-phosphate as substrates. The enzyme assays were analyzed by HPLC; the substrate flexibility of AmiE was probed with three unnatural sugars-1-phosphate, including galactose-1-phosphate, galactosamine-1-phosphate and mannos-1-phosphate.                  Results:                       The N-(His)6-tag AmiE was expressed in E. coli in soluble form and was successfully purified via Ni2+ mediated affinity chromatography; in vitro biochemical experiments showed that AmiE could convert glucose-1-phosphate into TDP-glucose (or UDP-glucose) in the presence of TTP (or UTP). However, galactose-1-phosphate, galactosamine-1-phosphate and mannos-1-phosphate were not substrates of AmiE.                  Conclusion:                       The amiE was successfully cloned and expressed in E. coli, and the purified AmiE was biochemically confirmed to be a nucleotylyltransferase in amicetin biosynthesis pathway.	1
Title: Stabilities of lyophilized Staphylococcus aureus typing bacteriophages Abstract: Staphylococcus aureus bacteriophages (25 phages) were lyophilized in aliquots 12 to 18 years ago and stored in vacuo at -20 degrees C. Eight viruses each lost one log titer, while seventeen retained the original titers. The use of lyophilized phages provided more reproducible phage typing and reduced by 75% the complexity and cost. This important test is thus made feasible for more laboratories.	0
Title: Functions of the siderophore esterases IroD and IroE in iron-salmochelin utilization Abstract: The siderophore salmochelin is produced under iron-poor conditions by Salmonella and many uropathogenic Escherichia coli strains. The production of salmochelin, a C-glucosylated enterobactin, is dependent on the synthesis of enterobactin and the iroBCDEN gene cluster. An E. coli IroD protein with an N-terminal His-tag cleaved cyclic salmochelin S4 to the linear trimer salmochelin S2, the dimer salmochelin S1, and the monomers dihydroxybenzoylserine and C-glucosylated dihydroxybenzoylserine (salmochelin SX, pacifarinic acid). The periplasmic IroE protein was purified as a MalE-IroE fusion protein. This enzyme degraded salmochelin S4 and ferric-salmochelin S4 to salmochelin S2 and ferric-salmochelin S2, respectively. In E. coli, uptake of ferric-salmochelin S4 was dependent on the cleavage by IroE, and independent of the FepBDGC ABC transporter in the cytoplasmic membrane. IroC, which has similarities to ABC-multidrug-resistance proteins, was necessary for the uptake of salmochelin S2 from the periplasm into the cytoplasm. IroE did not function as a classical binding protein since salmochelin S2 was taken up in the absence of a functional IroE protein. IroC mediated the uptake of iron via enterobactin in a fepB mutant. IroE was also necessary in this case for the uptake of ferric-enterobactin, which indicated that only the linear degradation products of enterobactin were taken up via IroC. PfeE, the Pseudomonas aeruginosa IroE homologue, was cloned, and its enzymic activity was shown to be very similar to that of IroE. It is suggested that homologues in other bacteria are also periplasmic IroE-type esterases of siderophores.	0
Title: Apoptogenic metabolites in fractions of the Benthic diatom Cocconeis scutellum parva Abstract: Benthic diatoms of the genus Cocconeis contain a specific apoptogenic activity. It triggers a fast destruction of the androgenic gland in the early post-larval life of the marine shrimp Hippolyte inermis, leading to the generation of small females. Previous in vitro investigations demonstrated that crude extracts of these diatoms specifically activate a dose-dependent apoptotic process in human cancer cells (BT20 breast carcinoma) but not in human normal lymphocytes. Here, a bioassay-guided fractionation has been performed to detect the apoptogenic compound(s). Various HPLC separation systems were needed to isolate the active fractions, since the apoptogenic metabolite is highly active, present in low amounts and is masked by abundant but non-active cellular compounds. The activity is due to at least two compounds characterized by different polarities, a hydrophilic and a lipophilic fraction. We purified the lipophilic fraction, which led to the characterization of an active sub-fraction containing a highly lipophilic compound, whose molecular structure has not yet been identified, but is under investigation. The results point to the possible medical uses of the active compound. Once the molecular structure has been identified, the study and modulation of apoptotic processes in various types of cells will be possible.	0
Title: Purification and characterization of S-adenosylhomocysteine deaminase from streptonigrin-producing Streptomyces flocculus Abstract: An S-adenosylhomocysteine deaminase has been isolated and purified from streptonigrin-producing Streptomyces flocculus ATCC 13257. Deamination represents the major metabolic route of S-adenosylhomocysteine in this organism. The protein was found to be monomeric with a molecular weight of 56,100 +/- 1,600. The activity was optimal at pH 7.0 and 37 degrees C, and the deaminase was inactivated by p-chloromercuribenzoate but not by metal chelators. The Km for S-adenosylhomocysteine is 2.5 mM, and the Ki for inhibition by deoxycoformycin is 1.6 nM.	0
Title: Glioperazine B, as a new antimicrobial agent against Staphylococcus aureus, and glioperazine C: two new dioxopiperazines from Bionectra byssicola Abstract: In the course of our screening for new antibacterials from microbial metabolites, two new dioxopiperazine metabolites, glioperazines B (1) and C (2), together with the known compound, glioperazine (3), were isolated from the mycelia of a liquid fermentation culture of the fungus, Bionectra byssicola F120. The structures of compounds 1 and 2 were assigned on the basis of MS and NMR data. Compound 1 is an unusual dioxopiperazine metabolite containing an OMe group at the alpha-carbon of the amino acid residue. Compound 1 showed weak antibacterial activity against various strains of S. aureus, including methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) and quinolone-resistant S. aureus (QRSA), while 2 and 3 did not show such activity.	0
Title: Host-mediated modification of Sau3AI restriction in Listeria monocytogenes: prevalence in epidemic-associated strains Abstract: Most major food-related outbreaks of listeriosis have been traced to a cluster of genetically related strains of serovar 4b (epidemic clone). In spite of numerous searches, distinct bacteriologic or virulence-related features unique to these strains have eluded identification, although a restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) characteristic of the epidemic clone has previously been described (W. Zheng and S. Kathariou, Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 61:4310-4314, 1995). We found that DNAs from 75 strains which were derived from three separate outbreaks and which had the epidemic clone-specific RFLP were also invariably resistant to digestion by Sau3AI and other restriction endonucleases sensitive to cytosine methylation at 5' GATC 3' sites. This modification of Sau3AI restriction was host mediated, as it did not persist when DNA was cloned and propagated in Escherichia coli, and was uncommon among other Listeria strains. Epidemic-associated strains with this modification were resistant to infection by phage propagated in a serotype 4b strain which was not known to be involved in an epidemic and which lacked the epidemic clone-specific RFLP. Screening for susceptibility to MboI digestion revealed that these epidemic strains lacked methylation of adenines at GATC sites. This type of modification was rare among Listeria strains and was found in only three (of eight screened) strains of serovar 1/2b, possibly representing one clonal lineage.	0
Title: An Expedient Synthesis of Flexible Nucleosides through Enzymatic Glycosylation of Proximal and Distal Fleximer Bases Abstract: The structurally unique "fleximer" nucleosides were originally designed to investigate how flexibility in a nucleobase could potentially affect receptor-ligand recognition and function. Recently they have been shown to have low-to-sub-micromolar levels of activity against a number of viruses, including coronaviruses, filoviruses, and flaviviruses. However, the synthesis of distal fleximers in particular has thus far been quite tedious and low yielding. As a potential solution to this issue, a series of proximal fleximer bases (flex-bases) has been successfully coupled to both ribose and 2'-deoxyribose sugars by using the N-deoxyribosyltransferase II of Lactobacillus leichmannii (LlNDT) and Escherichia coli purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP). To explore the range of this facile approach, transglycosylation experiments on a thieno-expanded tricyclic heterocyclic base, as well as several distal and proximal flex-bases were performed to determine whether the corresponding fleximer nucleosides could be obtained in this fashion, thus potentially significantly shortening the route to these biologically significant compounds. The results of those studies are reported herein.	0
Title: An environmental DNA-derived type II polyketide biosynthetic pathway encodes the biosynthesis of the pentacyclic polyketide erdacin Abstract: Environmental DNA-derived cosmid clones containing type II polyketide synthase genes were screened for the ability to produce clone-specific metabolites in Streptomyces. One of the Streptomyces recombinants produces erdacin, a novel polyketide with a previously unknown pentacyclic skeleton. Erdacin provides tangible evidence that environmental DNA gene clusters are likely to encode the biosynthesis of molecules that are substantively different from those that have been identified using culture-based strategies.	1
Title: Identification of the biosynthetic gene cluster for the pacidamycin group of peptidyl nucleoside antibiotics Abstract: Pacidamycins are a family of uridyl tetra/pentapeptide antibiotics that act on the translocase MraY to block bacterial cell wall assembly. To elucidate the biosynthetic logic of pacidamcyins, a putative gene cluster was identified by 454 shotgun genome sequencing of the producer Streptomyces coeruleorubidus NRRL 18370. The 31-kb gene cluster encodes 22 proteins (PacA-V), including highly dissociated nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) modules and a variety of tailoring enzymes. Gene deletions confirmed that two NRPSs, PacP and PacO, are required for the biosynthesis of pacidamycins. Heterologous expression and in vitro assays of PacL, PacO, and PacP established reversible formation of m-Tyr-AMP, l-Ala-AMP, and diaminopropionyl-AMP, respectively, consistent with the amino acids found in pacidamycin scaffolds. The unusual Ala(4)-Phe(5) dipeptidyl ureido linkage was formed during in vitro assays containing purified PacL, PacJ, PacN, and PacO. Both the genetic and enzymatic studies validate identification of the biosynthetic genes for this subclass of uridyl peptide antibiotics and provide the basis for future mechanistic study of their biosynthesis.	1
Title: The enduracidin biosynthetic gene cluster from Streptomyces fungicidicus Abstract: The biosynthetic gene cluster for the 17 aa peptide antibiotic enduracidin has been cloned and sequenced from Streptomyces fungicidicus ATCC 21013. The 84 kb gene cluster contains 25 ORFs and is located within a 116 kb genetic locus that was fully sequenced. Targeted disruption of non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) genes in the cluster abolished enduracidin production and confirmed function. The cluster includes four genes, endA-D, encoding two-, seven-, eight- and one-module NRPSs, respectively, and includes unique modules for the incorporation of citrulline and enduracididine. The NRPS organization generally follows the collinearity principle, and starts with a condensation domain (C domain) similar to those found in other lipopeptide systems for the coupling of an acyl group to the starting amino acid. The sixth module of EndB, corresponding to Thr(8), is missing an adenylation domain (A domain) and this module is presumed to be loaded in trans by the single module protein EndD. The most striking feature of the NRPS organization is the lack of epimerization domains (E domains) in light of the fact that the product has seven d-amino acid residues. Sequence analysis reveals that C domains following modules corresponding to d-amino acids belong to a unique subset of C domains able to catalyse both epimerization and condensation reactions. Other genes directing lipid modification and activation, and formation of the non-proteinogenic amino acids 4-hydroxyphenylglycine and enduracididine are readily identified, as are genes possibly involved in regulation of antibiotic biosynthesis and export. These findings provide the basis to further genetically manipulate and improve lipodepsipeptide antibiotics via combinatorial and chemical methods.	1
Title: Prochlorococcus ecotype abundances in the North Atlantic Ocean as revealed by an improved quantitative PCR method Abstract: The cyanobacterium Prochlorococcus numerically dominates the photosynthetic community in the tropical and subtropical regions of the world's oceans. Six evolutionary lineages of Prochlorococcus have been described, and their distinctive physiologies and genomes indicate that these lineages are "ecotypes" and should have different oceanic distributions. Two methods recently developed to quantify these ecotypes in the field, probe hybridization and quantitative PCR (QPCR), have shown that this is indeed the case. To facilitate a global investigation of these ecotypes, we modified our QPCR protocol to significantly increase its speed, sensitivity, and accessibility and validated the method in the western and eastern North Atlantic Ocean. We showed that all six ecotypes had distinct distributions that varied with depth and location, and, with the exception of the deeper waters at the western North Atlantic site, the total Prochlorococcus counts determined by QPCR matched the total counts measured by flow cytometry. Clone library analyses of the deeper western North Atlantic waters revealed ecotypes that are not represented in the culture collections with which the QPCR primers were designed, explaining this discrepancy. Finally, similar patterns of relative ecotype abundance were obtained in QPCR and probe hybridization analyses of the same field samples, which could allow comparisons between studies.	0
Title: UMI-linked consensus sequencing enables phylogenetic analysis of directed evolution Abstract: The success of protein evolution campaigns is strongly dependent on the sequence context in which mutations are introduced, stemming from pervasive non-additive interactions between a protein's amino acids ('intra-gene epistasis'). Our limited understanding of such epistasis hinders the correct prediction of the functional contributions and adaptive potential of mutations. Here we present a straightforward unique molecular identifier (UMI)-linked consensus sequencing workflow (UMIC-seq) that simplifies mapping of evolutionary trajectories based on full-length sequences. Attaching UMIs to gene variants allows accurate consensus generation for closely related genes with nanopore sequencing. We exemplify the utility of this approach by reconstructing the artificial phylogeny emerging in three rounds of directed evolution of an amine dehydrogenase biocatalyst via ultrahigh throughput droplet screening. Uniquely, we are able to identify lineages and their founding variant, as well as non-additive interactions between mutations within a full gene showing sign epistasis. Access to deep and accurate long reads will facilitate prediction of key beneficial mutations and adaptive potential based on in silico analysis of large sequence datasets.	0
Title: Chemical crosslinking of a solubilized enkephalin macromolecular complex Abstract: Covalently bound [3H]D-Ala2,Met5-enkephalinamide- and 125I-labeled D-Ala2,N-Me-Phe4,Met-(O)5-ol-enkephalin-macromolecule complexes have been prepared by crosslinking the solubilized noncovalent complexes from rat brain. Gel electrophoresis of the partially purified 125I-labeled enkephalin-macromolecule complex under nondenaturing conditions results in a single major/radioactive peak. The complex has a Stokes radius of approximately 48 A as determined by molecular exclusion chromatography; this radius corresponds to a molecular weight of 380,000 for a spherical molecule. In preliminary experiments, sodium dodecyl sulfate electrophoresis of the complex shows a major radioactive peak corresponding to a molecular weight of 35,000. The preparation of these specific covalent enkephalin-macromolecule complexes should be useful in purification of the receptor and in probing the molecular mechanism of opiate action.	0
Title: Genetic organization and sequence of the Pseudomonas cepacia genes for the alpha and beta subunits of protocatechuate 3,4-dioxygenase Abstract: The locations of the genes for the alpha and beta subunits of protocatechuate 3,4-dioxygenase (EC 1.13.11.3) on a 9.5-kilobase-pair PstI fragment cloned from the Pseudomonas cepacia DBO1 chromosome were determined. This was accomplished through the construction of several subclones into the broad-host-range cloning vectors pRO2317, pRO2320, and pRO2321. The ability of each subclone to complement mutations in protocatechuate 3,4-dioxygenase (pcaA) was tested in mutant strains derived from P. cepacia, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Pseudomonas putida. These complementation studies also showed that the two subunits were expressed from the same promoter. The nucleotide sequence of the region encoding for protocatechuate 3,4-dioxygenase was determined. The deduced amino acid sequence matched that determined by N-terminal analysis of regions of the isolated enzyme. Although over 400 nucleotides were sequenced before the start of the genes, no homology to known promoters was found. However, a terminator stem-loop structure was found immediately after the genes. The deduced amino acid sequence showed extensive homology with the previously determined amino acid sequence of protocatechuate 3,4-dioxygenase from another Pseudomonas species.	0
Title: Colibrimycins, Novel Halogenated Hybrid Polyketide Synthase-Nonribosomal Peptide Synthetase (PKS-NRPS) Compounds Produced by Streptomyces sp. Strain CS147 Abstract: The improvement of genome sequencing techniques has brought to light the biosynthetic potential of actinomycetes due to the large number of gene clusters they present compared to the number of known compounds. Genome mining is a recent strategy in the search for novel bioactive compounds, which involves the analysis of sequenced genomes to identify uncharacterized natural product biosynthetic gene clusters, many of which are cryptic or silent under laboratory conditions, and to develop experimental approaches to identify their products. Owing to the importance of halogenation in terms of structural diversity, bioavailability, and bioactivity, searching for new halogenated bioactive compounds has become an interesting issue in the field of natural product discovery. Following this purpose, a screening for halogenase coding genes was performed on 12 Streptomyces strains isolated from fungus-growing ants of the Attini tribe. Using the bioinformatics tools antiSMASH and BLAST, six halogenase coding genes were identified. Some of these genes were located within biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs), which were studied by construction of several mutants for the identification of the putative halogenated compounds produced. The comparison of the metabolite production profile of wild-type strains and their corresponding mutants by ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography-UV and high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry allowed us the identification of a novel family of halogenated compounds in Streptomyces sp. strain CS147, designated colibrimycins. IMPORTANCE Genome mining has proven its usefulness in the search for novel bioactive compounds produced by microorganisms, and halogenases comprise an interesting starting point. In this work, we have identified a new halogenase coding gene that led to the discovery of novel lipopetide nonribosomal peptide synthetase/polyketide synthase (NRPS/PKS)-derived natural products, the colibrimycins, produced by Streptomyces sp. strain CS147, isolated from the Attini ant niche. Some colibrimycins display an unusual α-ketoamide moiety in the peptide structure. Although its biosynthetic origin remains unknown, its presence might be related to a hypothetical inhibition of virus proteases, and, together with the presence of the halogenase, it represents a feature to be incorporated in the arsenal of structural modifications available for combinatorial biosynthesis.	1
Title: A carotenoid synthesis gene cluster from Algoriphagus sp. KK10202C with a novel fusion-type lycopene beta-cyclase gene Abstract: A carotenoid synthesis gene cluster was isolated from a marine bacterium Algoriphagus sp. strain KK10202C that synthesized flexixanthin. Seven genes were transcribed in the same direction, among which five of them were involved in carotenoid synthesis. This cluster had a unique gene organization, with an isoprenoid gene, ispH (previously named lytB), being present among the carotenoid synthesis genes. The lycopene beta-cyclase encoded by the crtY ( cd ) gene appeared to be a fusion of bacterial heterodimeric lycopene cyclase CrtY(c) and CrtY(d). This was the first time that a fusion-type of lycopene beta-cyclase was reported in eubacteria. Heterologous expression of the Algoriphagus crtY ( cd ) gene in lycopene-accumulating Escherichia coli produced bicyclic beta-carotene. A biosynthesis pathway for monocyclic flexixanthin was proposed in Algoriphagus sp. strain KK10202C, though several of the carotenoid synthesis genes not linked with the cluster have not yet been cloned.	1
Title: Precursor proteins are transported into mitochondria in the absence of proteolytic cleavage of the additional sequences Abstract: Many nuclear-coded mitochondrial proteins are synthesized as larger precursor polypeptides that are proteolytically processed during import into the mitochondrion. This processing appears to be catalyzed by a soluble, metal-dependent protease localized in the mitochondrial matrix. In this report we employ an in vitro system to investigate the role of processing in protein import. Intact Neurospora crassa mitochondria were incubated with radiolabeled precursors in the presence of the chelator o-phenanthroline. Under these conditions, the processing of the precursors of the beta-subunit of F1-ATPase (F1 beta) and subunit 9 of the F0F1-ATPase was strongly inhibited. Protease-mapping studies indicated that import of the precursor proteins into the mitochondria continued in the absence of processing. Upon readdition of divalent metal to the treated mitochondria, the imported precursors were quantitatively converted to their mature forms. This processing of imported precursors occurred in the absence of a mitochondrial membrane potential and was extremely rapid even at 0 degrees C. This suggests that all or part of the polypeptide chain of the imported precursors had been translocated into the matrix location of the processing enzyme. Localization experiments suggested that the precursor to F1 beta is peripherally associated with the mitochondrial membrane while the precursor to subunit 9 appeared to be tightly bound to the membrane. We conclude that proteolytic processing is not necessary for the translocation of precursor proteins across mitochondrial membranes, but rather occurs subsequent to this event. On the basis of these and other results, a hypothetical pathway for the import of F1 beta and subunit 9 is proposed.	0
Title: An in planta-expressed polyketide synthase produces (R)-mellein in the wheat pathogen Parastagonospora nodorum Abstract: Parastagonospora nodorum is a pathogen of wheat that affects yields globally. Previous transcriptional analysis identified a partially reducing polyketide synthase (PR-PKS) gene, SNOG_00477 (SN477), in P. nodorum that is highly upregulated during infection of wheat leaves. Disruption of the corresponding SN477 gene resulted in the loss of production of two compounds, which we identified as (R)-mellein and (R)-O-methylmellein. Using a Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast heterologous expression system, we successfully demonstrated that SN477 is the only enzyme required for the production of (R)-mellein. This is the first identification of a fungal PKS that is responsible for the synthesis of (R)-mellein. The P. nodorum ΔSN477 mutant did not show any significant difference from the wild-type strain in its virulence against wheat. However, (R)-mellein at 200 μg/ml inhibited the germination of wheat (Triticum aestivum) and barrel medic (Medicago truncatula) seeds. Comparative sequence analysis identified the presence of mellein synthase (MLNS) homologues in several Dothideomycetes and two sodariomycete genera. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that the MLNSs in fungi and bacteria evolved convergently from fungal and bacterial 6-methylsalicylic acid synthases.	1
Title: Fractionation and Antitumor Activity of Polysaccharides from Grifola frondosa Mycelium Abstract: We developed a method for the fractionation and purification of antitumor polysaccharides, considered to be a type of immuno-potentiator or BRM (biological response modifier), from the mycelium of liquid cultured Grifola frondosa. The active polysaccharide fractions that showed higher antitumor activity were considered to be heteroglycans or their protein complexes as follows, in water-soluble fractions: FI0-a-α: fucoga-lactomannan-protein complex; FI0-a-β: mannogalactofucan; FA-1: galactoglucomannofucan-protein complex; FA-2-b-α: glucogalactomannan-protein complex; in water-insoluble fractions: FIII-1-a: mannofucoglucoxylan; FIII-1-b: mannoglucofucoxylan-protein complex; FIII-2-a: mannofucoglucoxylan-protein complex; FIII-2-b: glucomannofucoxylan-protein complex.	0
Title: Novel approaches for efficient in vivo fermentation production of noncoding RNAs Abstract: Genome-derived noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs), including microRNAs (miRNAs), small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), and long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), play an essential role in the control of target gene expression underlying various cellular processes, and dysregulation of ncRNAs is involved in the pathogenesis and progression of various diseases in virtually all species including humans. Understanding ncRNA biology has opened new avenues to develop novel RNA-based therapeutics. Presently, ncRNA research and drug development is dominated by the use of ncRNA mimics that are synthesized chemically in vitro and supplemented with extensive and various types of artificial modifications and thus may not necessarily recapitulate the properties of natural RNAs generated and folded in living cells in vivo. Therefore, there are growing interests in developing novel technologies for in vivo production of RNA molecules. The two most recent major breakthroughs in achieving an efficient, large-scale, and cost-effective fermentation production of recombinant or bioengineered RNAs (e.g., tens of milligrams from 1 L of bacterial culture) are (1) using stable RNA carriers and (2) direct overexpression in RNase III-deficient bacteria, while other approaches offer a low yield (e.g., nano- to microgram scales per liter). In this article, we highlight these novel microbial fermentation-based technologies that have shifted the paradigm to the production of true biological ncRNA molecules for research and development.	0
Title: Ethambutol Partitioning in Tuberculous Pulmonary Lesions Explains Its Clinical Efficacy Abstract: Clinical trials and practice have shown that ethambutol is an important component of the first-line tuberculosis (TB) regime. This contrasts the drug's rather modest potency and lack of activity against nongrowing persister mycobacteria. The standard plasma-based pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic profile of ethambutol suggests that the drug may be of limited clinical value. Here, we hypothesized that this apparent contradiction may be explained by favorable penetration of the drug into TB lesions. First, we utilized novel in vitro lesion pharmacokinetic assays and predicted good penetration of the drug into lesions. We then employed mass spectrometry imaging and laser capture microdissection coupled to liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry (LCM and LC/MS-MS, respectively) to show that ethambutol, indeed, accumulates in diseased tissues and penetrates the major human-like lesion types represented in the rabbit model of TB disease with a lesion-to-plasma exposure ratio ranging from 9 to 12. In addition, ethambutol exhibits slow but sustained passive diffusion into caseum to reach concentrations markedly higher than those measured in plasma at steady state. The results explain why ethambutol has retained its place in the first-line regimen, validate our in vitro lesion penetration assays, and demonstrate the critical importance of effective lesion penetration for anti-TB drugs. Our findings suggest that in vitro and in vivo lesion penetration evaluation should be included in TB drug discovery programs. Finally, this is the first time that LCM with LC-MS/MS has been used to quantify a small molecule at high spatial resolution in infected tissues, a method that can easily be extended to other infectious diseases.	0
Title: Semisynthetic analogues of toxiferine I and their pharmacological properties at α7 nAChRs, muscle-type nAChRs, and the allosteric binding site of muscarinic M2 receptors Abstract: A new series of analogues of the calabash curare alkaloid toxiferine I was prepared and pharmacologically evaluated at α7 and muscle-type nAChRs and the allosteric site of muscarinic M2 receptors. The new ligands differ from toxiferine I by the absence of one (2a-c) or two (3a-c) hydroxy groups, saturation of the exocyclic double bonds, and various N-substituents (methyl, allyl, 4-nitrobenzyl). At the muscle-type nAChRs, most ligands showed similar binding to the muscle relaxant alcuronium, indicating neuromuscular blocking activity, with the nonhydroxylated analogues 3b (Ki = 75 nM) and 3c (Ki = 82 nM) displaying the highest affinity. At α7 nAChRs, all ligands showed a moderate to low antagonistic effect, suggesting that the alcoholic functions are not necessary for antagonistic action. Compound 3c exerted the highest preference for the muscle-type nAChRs (Ki = 82 nM) over α7 (IC50 = 21 μM). As for the allosteric site of M2 receptors, binding was found to be dependent on N-substitution rather than on the nature of the side chains. The most potent ligands were the N-allyl analogues 2b and 3b (EC0.5,diss = 12 and 36 nM) and the N-nitrobenzyl derivatives 2c and 3c (EC0.5,diss = 32 and 49 nM). The present findings should help delineate the structural requirements for activity at different types of AChRs and for the design of novel selective ligands.	0
Title: Anthranilate-activating modules from fungal nonribosomal peptide assembly lines Abstract: Fungal natural products containing benzodiazepinone- and quinazolinone-fused ring systems can be assembled by nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPS) using the conformationally restricted beta-amino acid anthranilate as one of the key building blocks. We validated that the first module of the acetylaszonalenin synthetase of Neosartorya fischeri NRRL 181 activates anthranilate to anthranilyl-AMP. With this as a starting point, we then used bioinformatic predictions about fungal adenylation domain selectivities to identify and confirm an anthranilate-activating module in the fumiquinazoline A producer Aspergillus fumigatus Af293 as well as a second anthranilate-activating NRPS in N. fischeri. This establishes an anthranilate adenylation domain code for fungal NRPS and should facilitate detection and cloning of gene clusters for benzodiazepine- and quinazoline-containing polycyclic alkaloids with a wide range of biological activities.	1
Title: Cloning and functional characterization of a 30 kb gene locus required for lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis in Legionella pneumophila Abstract: The spontaneous Legionella pneumophila lipopolysaccharide (LPS) mutant 137, which did not bind the LPS-specific mAb 2625, was complemented with a genomic library from the parental wild-type strain. Transformants were screened for reconstitution of the wild-type LPS phenotype, able to bind mAb 2625. By this strategy, a 32,661 bp region comprising 30 open reading frames (Orfs) was identified. Orfs with significant homologies to genes encoding enzymes required for LPS or capsule biosynthesis of Gram-negative bacteria were located on the gene locus. The mutation of strain 137 could be assigned to a deletion of a cytosine residue in Orf 8. The protein encoded by Orf 8 exhibited homology to bacterial methyl-transferases. The L. pneumophila LPS gene locus included genes with deduced products likely to be involved in LPS core oligosaccharide biosynthesis (rmlA-D, rhamnosyl-transferases, acetyl-transferase) as well as LPS O-chain biosynthesis and translocation (mnaA, neuB, neuA, wecA, wzt, wzm). The neuA (Orf 25) and neuB (Orf 24) gene products were functionally characterized by complementation of the capsule negative E. coli K1 mutants EV5 and EV24, respectively. By introduction of the L. pneumophila neuA gene into E. coli EV5 and the neuB gene into EV24, expression of the K1 polysialic acid capsule could be restored. We, therefore, conclude that the biosynthesis pathway of legionaminic acid, the structural unit of the L. pneumophila Sg1 O-antigen, might be similar to the biosynthesis of sialic acid. Southern blot analysis indicated the entire gene locus to be present in L. pneumophila serogroup (Sg)1 strains, whereas only parts of the DNA stretch hybridized to DNA from Sg2 to Sg14 strains.	1
Title: Pharmacokinetics of sparfloxacin and interaction with cisapride and sucralfate Abstract: In an open, randomized, triple crossover study, the effects of cisapride and sucralfate on the pharmacokinetics of sparfloxacin were assessed. Fifteen healthy volunteers received 400 mg of sparfloxacin as a single oral dose on day 0. In a random order, concomitant doses of 10 mg of cisapride three times daily from day -2 to day 2 and 1 g of sucralfate four times daily from day -2 to day 0 were administered. Sparfloxacin concentrations were measured by bioassay and high-performance liquid chromatography. Pharmacokinetic parameters for sparfloxacin alone were as follows (mean +/- standard deviation): maximum concentration of drug in serum (C(max)), 1.27 +/- 0.39 microg/ml; time to C(max) (T(max)), 4.1 +/- 1.9 h; area under the concentration-time curve (AUC), 35.0 +/- 9.7 microg x h/ml; mean residence time, 28.5 +/- 5.7 h; half-life (t1/2), 20 +/- 4 h; urinary recovery (UR x f), 11.0% +/- 2.7%; and metabolite-sparfloxacin ratio in urine, 2.6. For the cisapride group there was a significant decrease in the sparfloxacin T(max) (1.9 +/- 2.1 h) and a significant increase in C(max) (1.74 +/- 0.73 microg/ml). The QTc interval for patients receiving sparfloxacin and cisapride was prolonged by 7.7% compared to the QTc interval during medication-free periods. Significant differences in the values for the group receiving sucralfate compared to the values for the group receiving sparfloxacin alone were found: C(max), 0.77 +/- 0.31 microg/ml; AUC, 18.6 +/- 5.8 microg x h/ml; t1/2, 26 +/- 10 h; and UR x f, 5.8 +/- 1.8%. Concomitant adminstration of cisapride accelerates the absorption and increases the peak concentration of sparfloxacin without having a significant effect on the extent of bioavailability. Coadministration of sucralfate leads to a 44% decrease in the bioavailability of sparfloxacin.	0
Title: Core Steps to the Azaphilone Family of Fungal Natural Products Abstract: Azaphilones are a family of polyketide-based fungal natural products that exhibit interesting and useful bioactivities. This minireview explores the literature on various characterised azaphilone biosynthetic pathways, which allows for a proposed consensus scheme for the production of the core azaphilone structure, as well as identifying early diversification steps during azaphilone biosynthesis. A consensus understanding of the core enzymatic steps towards a particular family of fungal natural products can aid in genome-mining experiments. Genome mining for novel fungal natural products is a powerful technique for both exploring chemical space and providing new insights into fungal natural product pathways.	0
Title: The biosynthetic pathway for aurofusarin in Fusarium graminearum reveals a close link between the naphthoquinones and naphthopyrones Abstract: Fungal polyketide biosynthesis typically involves multiple enzymatic steps and the encoding genes are often found in gene clusters. A gene cluster containing PKS12, the polyketide synthase gene responsible for the synthesis of the pigment aurofusarin, was analysed by gene replacement using Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation to determine the biosynthesis pathway of aurofusarin. Replacement of aurR1 with hygB shows that it encodes a positively acting transcription factor that is required for the full expression of PKS12, aurJ, aurF, gip1 and FG02329.1, which belong to the gene cluster. AurR1 and PKS12 deletion mutants are unable to produce aurofusarin and rubrofusarin. Bio- and chemoinformatics combined with chemical analysis of replacement mutants (DeltaaurJ, DeltaaurF, Deltagip1, DeltaaurO and DeltaPKS12) indicate a five-step enzyme catalysed pathway for the biosynthesis of aurofusarin, with rubrofusarin as an intermediate. This links the biosynthesis of naphthopyrones and naphthoquinones together. Replacement of the putative transcription factor aurR2 results in an increased level of rubrofusarin relative to aurofusarin. Gip1, a putative laccase, is proposed to be responsible for the dimerization of two oxidized rubrofusarin molecules resulting in the formation of aurofusarin.	1
Title: Hancockiamides: phenylpropanoid piperazines from Aspergillus hancockii are biosynthesised by a versatile dual single-module NRPS pathway Abstract: The hancockiamides are an unusual new family of N-cinnamoylated piperazines from the Australian soil fungus Aspergillus hancockii. Genomic analyses of A. hancockii identified a biosynthetic gene cluster (hkm) of 12 genes, including two single-module nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) genes. Heterologous expression of the hkm cluster in A. nidulans confirmed its role in the biosynthesis of the hancockiamides. We further demonstrated that a novel cytochrome P450, Hkm5, catalyses the methylenedioxy bridge formation, and that the PAL gene hkm12 is dispensable, but contributes to increased production of the cinnamoylated hancockiamides. In vitro enzymatic assays and substrate feeding studies demonstrated that NRPS Hkm11 activates and transfers trans-cinnamate to the piperazine scaffold and has flexibility to accept bioisosteric thienyl and furyl analogues. This is the first reported cinnamate-activating fungal NRPS. Expression of a truncated cluster lacking the acetyltransferase gene led to seven additional congeners, including an unexpected family of 2,5-dibenzylpiperazines. These pleiotropic effects highlight the plasticity of the pathway and the power of this approach for accessing novel natural product scaffolds.	1
Title: Quantification of real-time Salmonella effector type III secretion kinetics reveals differential secretion rates for SopE2 and SptP Abstract: Gram-negative pathogenic bacteria such as Salmonella utilize the type III secretion system to inject bacterial effector proteins into a host cell. Upon entry, these effectors bind mammalian cell proteins, hijack cellular signaling pathways, and redirect cellular function, thus enabling bacterial infection. In this study we use the FlAsH/tetracysteine labeling system to fluorescently tag specific effectors in Salmonella to observe real-time secretion of these proteins into a mammalian host cell. The tetracysteine tag is genomically incorporated, thus preserving endogenous control of bacterial effectors. We demonstrate that two effectors, SopE2 and SptP, exhibit different secretion kinetics, as well as different rates of degradation within the host cell. These proteins respectively activate and suppress GTPase Cdc42, suggesting that there is a temporal hierarchy for effector delivery and persistence within the cell that is directly related to effector function.	0
Title: Cloning, sequencing and disruption of a gene from Streptomyces clavuligerus involved in clavulanic acid biosynthesis Abstract: During the purification of delta-(L-alpha-aminoadipyl)-L-cysteinyl-D-valine synthetase (ACVS) from Streptomyces clavuligerus, a small protein (CLA) involved in clavulanic acid production co-purified with ACVS. A 24-mer mixed-DNA probe based on the N-terminal amino-acid sequence of CLA was used to isolate the corresponding gene (cla), located near one end of the known cluster of penicillin and cephamycin biosynthetic genes, 5.7 kb downstream from the pcbC gene which encodes isopenicillin-N synthase. The sequence of cla would encode a protein of 313 aa with a high degree of similarity to amidinohydrolase enzymes. The cla gene is located immediately upstream from the previously described clavaminate synthase 2-encoding gene (cs2), and cla homologs were only present in streptomycetes which produced clavam compounds. Replacement of cla with a disrupted copy of the gene blocked the production of clavulanic acid in starch asparagine medium (SA).	1
Title: Inactivation of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 in blood samples stored as high-salt lysates Abstract: Blood samples to be tested for the presence of parasite DNA by using specific DNA probes are routinely stored in our laboratory as high-salt lysates (HSL). To safeguard against the risk of accidental infection with etiological agents such as the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) while manipulating large numbers of blood samples in preparation for DNA probing, we determined the residual infectivity of HIV-1 after exposure to HSL components. Both high-titer virus stocks or provirus-carrying cells, suspended either in tissue culture medium or freshly drawn blood, were completely inactivated upon contact with the HSL components. This was verified by the absence of any detectable HIV-1-specific antigen in the supernatants of long-term cultures and the absence of virus-specific DNA fragments after amplification by polymerase chain reaction with DNA from such cultures as target DNA. These results support the conclusion that the virus is in fact completely inactivated by contact with the HSL components, rendering blood specimens stored as HSL noninfectious in regard to HIV-1.	0
Title: Cytotoxic withanolide constituents of Physalis longifolia Abstract: Fourteen new withanolides, 1-14, named withalongolides A-N, respectively, were isolated from the aerial parts of Physalis longifolia together with eight known compounds (15-22). The structures of compounds 1-14 were elucidated through spectroscopic techniques and chemical methods. In addition, the structures of withanolides 1, 2, 3, and 6 were confirmed by X-ray crystallographic analysis. Using a MTS viability assay, eight withanolides (1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 15, 16, and 19) and four acetylated derivatives (1a, 1b, 2a, and 2b) showed potent cytotoxicity against human head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (JMAR and MDA-1986), melanoma (B16F10 and SKMEL-28), and normal fetal fibroblast (MRC-5) cells with IC₅₀ values in the range between 0.067 and 9.3 μM.	0
Title: Heparin antagonism by polyvalent display of cationic motifs on virus-like particles Abstract: Particles to the rescue! The construction of cationic amino acid motifs on the surface of bacteriophage Qbeta by genetic engineering or chemical conjugation gives particles that are potent inhibitors of the anticoagulant action of heparin, which is a common anticlotting agent subject to clinical overdose.Polyvalent interactions allow biological structures to exploit low-affinity ligand-receptor binding events to affect physiological responses. We describe here the use of bacteriophage Qbeta as a multivalent platform for the display of polycationic motifs that act as heparin antagonists. Point mutations to the coat protein allowed us to generate capsids bearing the K16M, T18R, N10R, or D14R mutations; because 180 coat proteins form the capsid, the mutants provide a spectrum of particles differing in surface charge by as much as +540 units (K16M vs. D14R). Whereas larger poly-Arg insertions (for example, C-terminal Arg(8)) did not yield intact virions, it was possible to append chemically synthesized oligo-Arg peptides to stable wild-type (WT) and K16M platforms. Heparin antagonism by the particles was evaluated by using the activated partial thrombin time (aPTT) clotting assay; this revealed that T18R, D14R, and WT-(R(8)G(2))(95) were the most effective at disrupting heparin-mediated anticoagulation (>95 % inhibition). This activity agreed with measurements of zeta potential (ZP) and retention time on cation exchange chromatography for the genetic constructs, which distribute their added positive charge over the capsid surface (+180 and +360 for T18R and D14R relative to WT). The potent activity of WT-(R(8)G(2))(95), despite its relatively diminished overall surface charge is likely a consequence of the particle's presentation of locally concentrated regions with high positive charge density that interact with heparin's extensively sulfated domains. The engineered cationic capsids retained their ability to inhibit heparin at high concentrations and showed no anticlotting activity of the kind that limits the utility of antiheparin polycationic agents that are currently in clinical use.	0
Title: Olefin Metathesis in Confined Geometries: A Biomimetic Approach toward Selective Macrocyclization Abstract: The synthesis of macrocycles is severely impeded by concomitant oligomer formation. Here, we present a biomimetic approach that utilizes spatial confinement to increase macrocyclization selectivity in the ring-closing metathesis of various dienes at elevated substrate concentration up to 25 mM using an olefin metathesis catalyst selectively immobilized inside ordered mesoporous silicas with defined pore diameters. By this approach, the ratio between macro(mono)cyclization (MMC) product and all undesired oligomerization products (O) resulting from acyclic diene metathesis polymerization was increased from 0.55, corresponding to 35% MMC product obtained with the homogeneous catalyst, up to 1.49, corresponding to 60% MMC product. A correlation between the MMC/O ratio and the substrate-to-pore-size ratio was successfully established. Modification of the inner pore surface with dimethoxydimethylsilane allowed fine-tuning the effective pore size and reversing surface polarity, which resulted in a further increase of the MMC/O ratio up to 2.2, corresponding to >68% MMC product. Molecular-level simulations in model pore geometries help to rationalize the complex interplay between spatial confinement, specific (substrate and product) interaction with the pore surface, and diffusive transport. These effects can be synergistically adjusted for optimum selectivity by suitable surface modification.	0
Title: Stabilization of Multimeric Proteins via Intersubunit Cyclization Abstract: Proteins with high catalytic efficiency and selectivity under mild conditions have long been appreciated by industrial and medicinal fields. These proteins, which are commonly multimeric, often possess low stability, impeding wider application. Currently, strategies to improve the stability of multimeric proteins concentrate on enhancing the interaction at internal interface of the subunits. In this report, we confirmed that the largely underestimated subunit terminal ends are as significant as the internal interface for protein stability. By connecting both the terminal ends and internal interface of subunits, the tetrameric Leifsonia alcohol dehydrogenase (LnADH) protein can been cyclized into a rigid form with significantly improved thermostability and resilience. The improvement in the temperature at which enzyme activity is reduced to 50% after a 15-min heat treatment (T5015) and melting temperature (Tm ) of the modified protein was 18°C and 23.3°C, respectively, which is superior to the results achieved by normal protein engineering. Our study provided a novel strategy to effectively improve the stability of multimeric proteins, which is suitable not only for the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) family but also other classes of proteins with close terminal ends.IMPORTANCE Industrially interesting proteins are generally multimeric proteins; however, their applications are often restricted due to low stability caused by the natural tendency of subunit disassociation. Current approaches targeting this problem mainly focus on enhancing the internal interfaces of the subunits to avoid their disassociation. In this study, we identified and confirmed the external interface to be significant for improving the stability of multimeric proteins. By connecting the terminal ends and internal interface with disulfide bonds, we found that the multimeric protein LnADH cyclized into a robust monomeric-like form, resulting in superior thermostability compared to traditional protein engineering. This intersubunit cyclization approach is efficient and easy to perform, providing a novel method for engineering many important classes of multimeric proteins.	0
Title: A PKS/NRPS/FAS hybrid gene cluster from Serratia plymuthica RVH1 encoding the biosynthesis of three broad spectrum, zeamine-related antibiotics Abstract: Serratia plymuthica strain RVH1, initially isolated from an industrial food processing environment, displays potent antimicrobial activity towards a broad spectrum of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial pathogens. Isolation and subsequent structure determination of bioactive molecules led to the identification of two polyamino antibiotics with the same molecular structure as zeamine and zeamine II as well as a third, closely related analogue, designated zeamine I. The gene cluster encoding the biosynthesis of the zeamine antibiotics was cloned and sequenced and shown to encode FAS, PKS as well as NRPS related enzymes in addition to putative tailoring and export enzymes. Interestingly, several genes show strong homology to the pfa cluster of genes involved in the biosynthesis of long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids in marine bacteria. We postulate that a mixed FAS/PKS and a hybrid NRPS/PKS assembly line each synthesize parts of the backbone that are linked together post-assembly in the case of zeamine and zeamine I. This interaction reflects a unique interplay between secondary lipid and secondary metabolite biosynthesis. Most likely, the zeamine antibiotics are produced as prodrugs that undergo activation in which a nonribosomal peptide sequence is cleaved off.	1
Title: Parsing a multifunctional biosynthetic gene cluster from rice: Biochemical characterization of CYP71Z6 & 7 Abstract: Rice (Oryza sativa) contains a biosynthetic gene cluster associated with production of at least two groups of diterpenoid phytoalexins, the antifungal phytocassanes and antibacterial oryzalides. While cytochromes P450 (CYP) from this cluster are known to be involved in phytocassane production, such mono-oxygenase activity relevant to oryzalide biosynthesis was unknown. Here we report biochemical characterization demonstrating that CYP71Z6 from this cluster acts as an ent-isokaurene C2-hydroxylase that is presumably involved in the biosynthesis of oryzalides. Our results further suggest that the closely related and co-clustered CYP71Z7 likely acts as a C2-hydroxylase involved in a latter step of phytocassane biosynthesis. Thus, CYP71Z6 & 7 appear to have evolved distinct roles in rice diterpenoid metabolism, offering insight into plant biosynthetic gene cluster evolution.	1
Title: Purification, characterization and synergism in autolysis of a group of 1,3-β-glucan hydrolases from the pilei of Coprinopsis cinerea fruiting bodies Abstract: Using a combined chromatography method, we simultaneously purified three protein fractions (II-2, II-3 and II-4) with 1,3-β-glucanase activity from extraction of pilei of Coprinopsis cinerea fruiting bodies. MALDI-TOF/TOF amino acid sequencing showed that these three fractions matched a putative exo-1,3-β-glucanase, a putative glucan 1,3-β-glucosidase and a putative glycosyl hydrolase family 16 protein annotated in the C. cinerea genome, respectively; however, they were characterized as a 1,3-β-glucosidase, an exo-1,3-β-glucanase and an endo-1,3-β-glucanase, respectively, by analysis of their substrate specificities and modes of action. This study explored how these three 1,3-β-glucoside hydrolases synergistically acted on laminarin: the endo-1,3-β-glucanase hydrolysed internal glycosidic bonds of laminarin to generate 1,3-β-oligosaccharides of various lengths, the exo-1,3-β-glucanase cleaved the longer-chain laminarioligosaccharides into short-chain disaccharides, laminaribiose and gentiobiose, and the 1,3-β-glucosidase further hydrolysed laminaribiose to glucose. The remaining gentiobiose must be hydrolysed by other 1,6-β-glucosidases. Therefore, the endo-1,3-β-glucanase, exo-1,3-β-glucanase and 1,3-β-glucosidase may act synergistically to completely degrade the 1,3-β-glucan backbone of the C. cinerea cell wall during fruiting body autolysis. These three 1,3-β-glucoside hydrolases share a similar optimum pH and optimum temperature, supporting the speculation that these enzymes work together under the same conditions to degrade 1,3-β-glucan in the C. cinerea cell wall during fruiting body autolysis.	0
Title: Regulatory cascade and biological activity of Beauveria bassiana oosporein that limits bacterial growth after host death Abstract: The regulatory network and biological functions of the fungal secondary metabolite oosporein have remained obscure. Beauveria bassiana has evolved the ability to parasitize insects and outcompete microbial challengers for assimilation of host nutrients. A novel zinc finger transcription factor, BbSmr1 (B. bassiana secondary metabolite regulator 1), was identified in a screen for oosporein overproduction. Deletion of Bbsmr1 resulted in up-regulation of the oosporein biosynthetic gene cluster (OpS genes) and constitutive oosporein production. Oosporein production was abolished in double mutants of Bbsmr1 and a second transcription factor, OpS3, within the oosporein gene cluster (ΔBbsmr1ΔOpS3), indicating that BbSmr1 acts as a negative regulator of OpS3 expression. Real-time quantitative PCR and a GFP promoter fusion construct of OpS1, the oosporein polyketide synthase, indicated that OpS1 is expressed mainly in insect cadavers at 24-48 h after death. Bacterial colony analysis in B. bassiana-infected insect hosts revealed increasing counts until host death, with a dramatic decrease (∼90%) after death that correlated with oosporein production. In vitro studies verified the inhibitory activity of oosporein against bacteria derived from insect cadavers. These results suggest that oosporein acts as an antimicrobial compound to limit microbial competition on B. bassiana-killed hosts, allowing the fungus to maximally use host nutrients to grow and sporulate on infected cadavers.	1
Title: Highly Versatile β-C(sp3)-H Iodination of Ketones Using a Practical Auxiliary Abstract: The first example of palladium(II)-catalyzed β-C(sp3)-H iodination of a wide range of ketones using a commercially available aminooxyacetic acid auxiliary has been achieved. This L, X-type directing group overcomes the limitations of the transient directing group approach for C(sp3)-H functionalization of ketones. Practical advantages of this method include simple installation of the auxiliary without chromatography, exceptional tolerance of α-functional groups, as well as alkenes and alkynes, and rapid access to diverse sterically hindered quaternary centers.	0
Title: The grpE protein of Escherichia coli. Purification and properties Abstract: The grpE gene of Escherichia coli was first identified because a mutation in it, grpE280, prevented bacteriophage lambda DNA replication in vivo. Subsequent work resulted in the identification of the grpE protein in two-dimensional gels and its classification as a heat shock protein. Here we report the purification of the grpE protein. We show that overproduction of grpE occurs in dnaK 103 bacteria which do not produce a functional Mr 72,000 dnaK protein. The grpE protein was purified from this strain primarily by its specific retention on a dnaK affinity column. The interaction between these two proteins, which is stable in the presence of 2 M KCl, allowed other proteins to be washed from this column. grpE was then eluted by ATP, which disrupts the interaction. During purification, grpE activity was monitored by its ability to complement an in vitro lambda dv DNA replication system dependent on the lambda O and lambda P proteins. The effect of ATP on the dnaK-grpE complex was also observed during sedimentation of the two proteins in glycerol gradients. Purified grpE protein has a Mr of approximately 23,000 under both denaturing and native conditions, as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and sedimentation, respectively. However, in the presence of dnaK under native conditions, grpE cosediments with dnaK. When ATP is added to the gradient, the complex is disrupted, and the two proteins sediment independently as monomers.	0
Title: Genome sequence of an industrial microorganism Streptomyces avermitilis: deducing the ability of producing secondary metabolites Abstract: Streptomyces avermitilis is a soil bacterium that carries out not only a complex morphological differentiation but also the production of secondary metabolites, one of which, avermectin, is commercially important in human and veterinary medicine. The major interest in this genus Streptomyces is the diversity of its production of secondary metabolites as an industrial microorganism. A major factor in its prominence as a producer of the variety of secondary metabolites is its possession of several metabolic pathways for biosynthesis. Here we report sequence analysis of S. avermitilis, covering 99% of its genome. At least 8.7 million base pairs exist in the linear chromosome; this is the largest bacterial genome sequence, and it provides insights into the intrinsic diversity of the production of the secondary metabolites of Streptomyces. Twenty-five kinds of secondary metabolite gene clusters were found in the genome of S. avermitilis. Four of them are concerned with the biosyntheses of melanin pigments, in which two clusters encode tyrosinase and its cofactor, another two encode an ochronotic pigment derived from homogentiginic acid, and another polyketide-derived melanin. The gene clusters for carotenoid and siderophore biosyntheses are composed of seven and five genes, respectively. There are eight kinds of gene clusters for type-I polyketide compound biosyntheses, and two clusters are involved in the biosyntheses of type-II polyketide-derived compounds. Furthermore, a polyketide synthase that resembles phloroglucinol synthase was detected. Eight clusters are involved in the biosyntheses of peptide compounds that are synthesized by nonribosomal peptide synthetases. These secondary metabolite clusters are widely located in the genome but half of them are near both ends of the genome. The total length of these clusters occupies about 6.4% of the genome.	1
Title: Cloning a part of the ochratoxin A biosynthetic gene cluster of Penicillium nordicum and characterization of the ochratoxin polyketide synthase gene Abstract: Penicillium nordicum is a fungal species able to produce high amounts of ochratoxin A. A 10kb genomic DNA fragment of P. nordicumn has been cloned which carries three long open reading frames. One open reading frame (otapksPN) has homology to fungal polyketide synthases. The second open reading frame (npsPN) has homology to non-ribosomal peptide synthetases and the third open reading frame (aspPN) has homology to fungal alkaline serine proteinases. The non-ribosomal peptide synthetase and the polyketide synthase are convergently transcribed. Interestingly, the polyketide synthase can be identified by PCR only in P. nordicum strains and not in the related species Penicillium verrucosum or in ochratoxigenic Aspergillus species, indicating that the ochratoxin polyketide synthases are different in the important ochratoxigenic species. In contrast, the non-ribosomal peptide synthetase can be identified in P. nordicum and P. verrucosum, but not in other species. An inactivation of the polyketide synthase resulted in strains with abolished capacity to produce ochratoxin A. Expression of the polyketide synthase correlates with ochratoxin A biosynthesis.	1
Title: Coumarin formation in novobiocin biosynthesis: beta-hydroxylation of the aminoacyl enzyme tyrosyl-S-NovH by a cytochrome P450 NovI Abstract: Background:                       Coumarin group antibiotics, such as novobiocin, coumermycin A1 and clorobiocin, are potent inhibitors of DNA gyrase. These antibiotics have been isolated from various Streptomyces species and all possess a 3-amino-4-hydroxy-coumarin moiety as their structural core. Prior labeling experiments on novobiocin established that the coumarin moiety was derived from L-tyrosine, probably via a beta-hydroxy-tyrosine (beta-OH-Tyr) intermediate. Recently the novobiocin gene cluster from Streptomyces spheroides was cloned and sequenced and allows analysis of the biosynthesis of the coumarin at the biochemical level using overexpressed and purified proteins.                  Results:                       Two open reading frames (ORFs), NovH and NovI, from the novobiocin producer S. spheroides have been overexpressed in Escherichia coli, purified and characterized for tyrosine activation and oxygenation which are the initial steps in coumarin formation. The 65 kDa NovH has two predicted domains, an adenylation (A) and a peptidyl carrier protein (PCP), reminiscent of non-ribosomal peptide synthetases. Purified NovH catalyzes L-tyrosyl-AMP formation by its A domain, can be posttranslationally phosphopantetheinylated on the PCP domain, and accumulates the covalent L-tyrosyl-S-enzyme intermediate on the holo PCP domain. The second enzyme in the pathway, NovI, is a 45 kDa heme protein that functions as a cytochrome P450-type monooxygenase with specificity for the tyrosyl-S-NovH acyl enzyme. The product beta-OH-tyrosyl-S-NovH was detected by alkaline release and high performance liquid chromatography analysis of radioactive [3H]beta-OH-Tyr and by mass spectrometry. Also detected was 4-OH-benzaldehyde, a retro aldol breakdown product of beta-OH-Tyr. The amino acid released was (3R,2S)-3-OH-Tyr by comparison with authentic standards.                  Conclusions:                       This work establishes that NovH and NovI are responsible for the formation of a beta-OH-Tyr intermediate that is covalently tethered to NovH in novobiocin biosynthesis. Comparable A-PCP/P450 pairs for amino acid beta-hydroxylation are found in various biosynthetic gene clusters, such as ORF19/ORF20 in the chloroeremomycin cluster for tyrosine, CumC/CumD in the coumermycin A1 cluster for tyrosine, and NikP1/NikQ in the nikkomycin cluster for histidine. This phenomenon of covalent docking of the amino acid in a kinetically stable thioester linkage prior to chemical modification by downstream tailoring enzymes, could represent a common strategy for controlling the partitioning of the amino acid for incorporation into secondary metabolites.	1
Title: Studies on condensed-heterocyclic azolium cephalosporins. II. Synthesis and antibacterial activity of 7 beta-[2-(2-aminothiazol-4-yl)-2(Z)-alkoxyiminoacetamido]-3-(condensed- heterocyclic azolium)methyl-3-cephem-4-carboxylates Abstract: From our series of studies on cephalosporins bearing condensed-heterocyclic azolium methyl groups at the 3 position in the cephalosporin nucleus, we describe here the synthesis and antibacterial activity of 7 beta-[2-(2-aminothiazol-4-yl)-2(Z)-alkoxyiminoacetamido]ceph alosporins containing imidazo[1,5-a]pyridinium, imidazo[1,2-b]pyridazinium, imidazo[1,2-a]pyrimidinium, imidazo[1,2-c]pyrimidinium, and pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyridinium methyl groups at the 3 position. Among the cephalosporins tested, 7 beta-[2-(2-aminothiazol-4-yl)-2(Z)-methoxyiminoacetamido]-3- (imidazo[1,5-a]pyridinium-2-yl) (1), (imidazo[1,2-b]pyridazinium-1-yl) (2), and (pyrazolo[1,5-a]-pyridinium-1-yl) (3)methyl-3-cephem-4-carboxylates showed potent antibacterial activity and broad antibacterial spectrum. The antibacterial activity of these cephalosporins (1 approximately 3) was superior to that of ceftazidime (CAZ). These results imply that the delocalization of the positive charge of the imidazo[1,5-a]pyridinium, pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyridinium and imidazo[1,2-b]pyridazinium groups leads to an expanded antibacterial spectrum and increased activity and that these condensed-heterocyclic compounds as well as imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine are effective moieties for improving antibacterial activity and spectrum.	0
Title: Novel pyoverdine biosynthesis gene(s) of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO Abstract: Conjugational mobilization of a Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 cosmid bank (in pMMB33) into a pyoverdine-deficient (pvd) mutant harbouring a mutation in the 47 min region of the chromosome yielded one clone which restored yellow-green pigmentation and fluorescence when grown on iron-deficient medium. The relevant pMMB33-derivative cosmid, pPYP17, contained a 15.1 kb insert which was subcloned into pKT240 as a 10.8 Sacl-CIal fragment conferring the same phenotype. This derivative, pPYP180, like pPYP17, also conferred an apparent wild-type phenotype on pvd mutants previously shown to map genetically in the 23 min region of the P. aeruginosa PAO chromosomes. Physical mapping indicated that the cloned DNA fragment is located at the 66-70 min region of the PAO chromosome, demonstrating that the restored apparent wild-type phenotype observed for the transconjugants was not the result of a true gene complementation. A gene interruption was obtained by replacing a 0.6 kb BgIll-BgIll region of pPYP180 necessary for the expression of the pigmentation/fluorescence phenotype, by a Hgr interposon (omega Hg). After conjugational transfer and introduction of the mutagenized fragment into the PAO1 chromosome by gene replacement, pyoverdine-deficient mutants were recovered, indicating that the fragment indeed contained at least one gene involved in pyoverdine synthesis. The yellow-green fluorescent compound produced by such cells harbouring plasmids pPYP17 or pPYP180 differed from pyoverdine in several aspects and was consequently named pseudoverdine. Although pseudoverdine was able to complex iron, it was unable to restore growth to pvd mutants in the presence of the iron chelator ethylenediamine di(o-hydroxyphenylacetic acid), or to mediate iron uptake into PAO1. Pseudoverdine lacked a peptide chain but possessed spectral properties similar to pyoverdine, suggesting that it was structurally related to the chromophore of the pyoverdine molecule. The recent structural determination of pseudoverdine as a coumarin derivative confirmed this view and sheds some light on the biosynthetic pathway of the pyoverdine chromophore.	1
Title: Clinical response and tolerability to and safety of saquinavir with low-dose ritonavir in human immunodeficiency virus type 1-infected mothers and their infants Abstract: Saquinavir boosted with low-dose ritonavir given with zidovudine and lamivudine was well tolerated by pregnant women and their infants. All mothers had <400 human immunodeficiency virus type 1 RNA copies/ml at delivery. Two had elevated liver transaminases and amylase. Seven infant adverse events were possibly treatment related (anemia, neutropenia, and hyperbilirubinemia).	0
Title: S-3578, a new broad spectrum parenteral cephalosporin exhibiting potent activity against both methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Synthesis and structure-activity relationships Abstract: A series of 7-aminothiadiazolylcephalosporins having a 1-(substituted)-1H-imidazo[4,5-b]pyridinium group at the C-3' position of the cephem nucleus were synthesized and evaluated for in vitro antibacterial activities. Among the cephalosporins prepared in this study, 7beta-[2-(5-amino-1,2,4-thiadiazol-3-yl)-2(Z)-ethoxyiminoacetamido]-3-[1-(3-methylaminopropyl)-1H-imidazo[4,5-b]pyridinium-4-yl]methyl-3-cephem-4-carboxylate sulfate (S-3578) showed extremely potent broad spectrum activity against both gram-positive bacteria including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and gram-negative bacteria including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and good water solubility.	0
Title: Identification of a novel aminopolycarboxylic acid siderophore gene cluster encoding the biosynthesis of ethylenediaminesuccinic acid hydroxyarginine (EDHA) Abstract: The mechanism of siderophore-mediated iron supply enhances fitness and survivability of microorganisms under iron limited growth conditions. One class of naturally occurring ionophores is the small aminopolycarboxylic acids (APCAs). Although they are structurally related to the most famous anthropogenic chelating agent, ethylenediaminetetraacetate (EDTA), they have been largely neglected by the scientific community. Here, we demonstrate the detection of APCA gene clusters by a computational screening of a nucleotide database. This genome mining approach enabled the discovery of a yet unknown APCA gene cluster in well-described actinobacterial strains, either known for their potential to produce valuable secondary metabolites (Streptomyces avermitilis) or for their pathogenic lifestyle (Streptomyces scabies, Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis, Corynebacterium ulcerans and Nocardia brasiliensis). The herein identified gene cluster was shown to encode the biosynthesis of APCA, ethylenediaminesuccinic acid hydroxyarginine (EDHA). Detailed and comparatively performed production and transcriptional profiling of EDHA and its biosynthesis genes showed strict iron-responsive biosynthesis.	1
Title: Benzodiazepine biosynthesis in Streptomyces refuineus Abstract: Anthramycin is a benzodiazepine alkaloid with potent antitumor and antibiotic activity produced by the thermophilic actinomycete Streptomyces refuineus sbsp. thermotolerans. In this study, the complete 32.5 kb gene cluster for the biosynthesis of anthramycin was identified by using a genome-scanning approach, and cluster boundaries were estimated via comparative genomics. A lambda-RED-mediated gene-replacement system was developed to provide supporting evidence for critical biosynthetic genes and to validate the boundaries of the proposed anthramycin gene cluster. Sequence analysis reveals that the 25 open reading frame anthramycin cluster contains genes consistent with the biosynthesis of the two halves of anthramycin: 4 methyl-3-hydroxyanthranilic acid and a "dehydroproline acrylamide" moiety. These nonproteinogenic amino acid precursors are condensed by a two-module nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) terminated by a reductase domain, consistent with the final hemiaminal oxidation state of anthramycin.	1
Title: Functional characterization of TtnD and TtnF, unveiling new insights into tautomycetin biosynthesis Abstract: The biosynthetic gene cluster for tautomycetin (TTN), a highly potent and selective protein phosphatase (PP) inhibitor isolated from Streptomyces griseochromogenes, has recently been cloned and sequenced. To better understand the transformations responsible for converting the post-polyketide synthase product into the exciting anticancer and immunosuppressive chemotherapeutic candidate TTN, we produced and characterized new analogues resulting from inactivation of two genes, ttnD and ttnF, in S. griseochromogenes. Inactivation of ttnD and ttnF, which encode for putative decarboxylase and dehydratase enzymes, respectively, afforded mutant strains SB13013 and SB13014. The DeltattnD mutant SB13013 accumulated four new TTN analogues, TTN D-1, TTN D-2, TTN D-3, and TTN D-4, whereas the DeltattnF mutant accumulated only one new TTN analogue, TTN F-1. The accumulation of these new TTN analogues defines the function of TtnD and TtnF and the timing of their chemistries in relation to installation of the C5 ketone moiety within TTN. Notably, all new analogues possess a structurally distinguishing carboxylic acid moiety, revealing that TtnD apparently cannot catalyze decarboxylation in the absence of TtnF. Additionally, cytotoxicity and PP inhibition assays reveal the importance of the functional groups installed by TtnDF and, consistent with earlier proposals, the C2''-C5 fragment of TTN to be a critical structural determinant behind the important and unique PP-1 selectivity displayed by TTN.	1
Title: RhI -Catalyzed PIII -Directed C-H Bond Alkylation: Design of Multifunctional Phosphines for Carboxylation of Aryl Bromides with Carbon Dioxide Abstract: We report the C-H alkylation of biarylphosphines at the ortho' position(s) with alkenes by using rhodium(I) catalysis, which provides straightforward access to a large library of multifunctionalized phosphines. Some of these modified ligands outperformed commercially available phosphines in the Pd-catalyzed carboxylation of aryl bromides with carbon dioxide in the presence of a photoredox catalyst.	0
Title: The acbH gene of Actinoplanes sp. encodes a solute receptor with binding activities for acarbose and longer homologs Abstract: Acarbose, a pseudomaltotetraose, is produced by strains of the genus Actinoplanes and is a potent inhibitor of alpha-glucosidases, including those from the human intestine. Therefore, it is used in the treatment of patients suffering from type 2 diabetes. The benefits of acarbose for the producer are not known; however, besides acting as an inhibitor of alpha-amylases secreted by competitors, a role as a 'carbophor' has been proposed. This would require a transport system mediating its uptake into the cytoplasm of Actinoplanes sp. A putative sugar ATP binding cassette (ABC) transport system, the genes of which are included within the biosynthetic gene cluster for acarbose, was suggested to be a possible candidate. The genes acbHFG encode a possible sugar binding protein (AcbH) and two membrane integral subunits (AcbFG). A gene coding for an ATPase component is missing. Since Actinoplanes sp. cannot yet be genetically manipulated we performed experiments to identify the substrate(s) of the putative transporter by assessing the substrate specificity of AcbH. The protein was overproduced in Escherichia coli as His10-fusion protein, purified under denaturating conditions and renatured. Refolding was verified by circular dichroism spectroscopy. Surface plasmon resonance studies revealed that AcbH binds acarbose and longer derivatives, but not maltodextrins, maltose or sucrose. Immunoblot analysis revealed the association of AcbH with the membrane fraction of Actinoplanes cells that were grown in the presence of maltose, maltodextrins or acarbose. Together, these findings suggest that the AcbHFG complex might be involved in the uptake of acarbose and are consistent with a role for acarbose as a 'carbophor'.	1
Title: Two new cellulosome components encoded downstream of celI in the genome of Clostridium thermocellum: the non-processive endoglucanase CelN and the possibly structural protein CseP Abstract: Clostridium thermocellum produces a great number of extracellular cellulases which are free or cellulosome-bound. The nucleotide sequence of a gene cluster containing the genes celI, celN and cseP was determined from C. thermocellum strain F7. Gene products Cel9I and Cel9N are structurally related enzymes having a glycosyl hydrolase family 9 and a carbohydrate-binding module (CBM3c), but show characteristic differences: Cel9I is a non-cellulosomal protein with an additional CBM (CBM3b), whereas Cel9N contains a cellulosomal dockerin module and no additional CBM. Although Cel9I is a processive endoglucanase, Cel9N is non-processive. Both enzymes hydrolyse phosphoric acid swollen cellulose, but the products of hydrolysis are different. The CseP protein encoded in the gene cluster is the first component attached to the cellulosomal scaffoldin for which no catalytic activity could be detected. It was shown to be present in the cellulosome. Its sequence is homologous to the spore-coat assembly protein CotH of Bacillus subtilis, suggesting a structural role of CseP in the cellulosome.	0
Title: Comparison of design strategies for promotion of beta-peptide 14-helix stability in water Abstract: Many short beta-peptides adopt well-defined conformations in organic solvents, but specialized stabilizing elements are required for folding to occur in aqueous solution. Several different strategies to stabilize the 14-helical secondary structure in water have been developed, and here we provide a direct comparison of three such strategies. We have synthesized and characterized beta-peptide heptamers in which variously a salt bridge between side chains, a covalent link between side chains, or two cyclically constrained residues have been incorporated to promote 14-helicity. The incorporation of a salt bridge does not generate significant 14-helicity in water, according to CD and 2D NMR data. In contrast, incorporation either of a lactam bridge between side chains or of cyclic residues results in stable 14-helices in water. The beta-peptides featuring trans-2-aminocyclohexanecarboxylic acid (ACHC) residues show the highest 14-helical backbone stability, with hardly any sensitivity to pH or ionic strength. The beta-peptides featuring side-chain-to-side-chain cyclization show lower 14-helical backbone stability and higher sensitivity to pH and ionic strength, but increased order between the side chains because of the cyclization.	0
Title: "Frizzy" mutants: a new class of aggregation-defective developmental mutants of Myxococcus xanthus Abstract: During fruiting-body formation in Myxococcus xanthus, cells aggregate into raised mounds, where they sporulate. A new class of aggregation-defective developmental mutants was identified within a collection of nonfruiting mutants of M. xanthus. The mutants failed to aggregate into discrete mounds, but rather aggregated into "frizzy" filaments. Many cells within the filaments sporulated normally. Pairwise mixtures of representative frizzy mutants were unable to stimulate each other to aggregate normally. Two strains of M. xanthus were isolated which contained transposon Tn5 insertions mapping near one frizzy mutation. A search through 36 mutants exhibiting the frizzy phenotype showed that all were linked to the same Tn5 insertion sites. Three-factor cross-analysis of 22 of these mutants allowed the mapping of these mutations into many loci. The localization of Tn5 inserts adjacent to this region make possible further manipulation of these genes.	0
Title: Spongiimicrobium salis gen. nov., sp. nov., a bacterium of the family Flavobacteriaceae isolated from a marine sponge Abstract: A Gram-stain-negative, strictly aerobic, pale-yellow pigmented, rod-shaped, chemoheterotrophic bacterium, designated A6F-11(T), was isolated from a marine sponge collected in Japan. Phylogenetic analysis based on the 16S rRNA gene sequence indicated that the novel marine strain was affiliated with the family Flavobacteriaceae of the phylum Bacteroidetes and that it shared the highest (92.9 %) sequence similarity with Arenibacter palladensis LMG 21972(T). The strain could be differentiated phenotypically from related members of the family Flavobacteriaceae. The major fatty acids of strain A6F-11(T) were iso-C15:1 G, iso-C15:0, C16:1 ω6c and/or C16:1 ω7c and iso-C17:0 3-OH. The polar lipid profile consisted of phosphatidylglycerol, two unidentified aminolipids and two unidentified lipids. The DNA G+C content was 34.7 mol%, and the major respiratory quinone was menaquinone 6 (MK-6). From the distinct phylogenetic position and combination of genotypic and phenotypic characteristics, the strain is considered to represent a novel taxon in the family Flavobacteriaceae, for which the name Spongiimicrobium salis gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain of S. salis gen. nov., sp. nov. is A6F-11(T) (= KCTC 42753(T) = NBRC 111401(T)).	0
Title: HPLC-based activity profiling: discovery of piperine as a positive GABA(A) receptor modulator targeting a benzodiazepine-independent binding site Abstract: A plant extract library was screened for GABA(A) receptor activity making use of a two-microelectrode voltage clamp assay on Xenopus laevis oocytes. An ethyl acetate extract of black pepper fruits [Piper nigrum L. (Piperaceae) 100 microg/mL] potentiated GABA-induced chloride currents through GABA(A) receptors (composed of alpha(1), beta(2), and gamma(2S) subunits) by 169.1 +/- 2.4%. With the aid of an HPLC-based activity profiling approach, piperine (5) was identified as the main active compound, together with 12 structurally related less active or inactive piperamides (1-4, 6-13). Identification was achieved by on-line high-resolution mass spectrometry and off-line microprobe 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopy, using only milligram amounts of extract. Compound 5 induced a maximum potentiation of the chloride currents by 301.9 +/- 26.5% with an EC(50) of 52.4 +/- 9.4 microM. A comparison of the modulatory activity of 5 and other naturally occurring piperamides enabled insights into structural features critical for GABA(A) receptor modulation. The stimulation of chloride currents through GABA(A) receptors by compound 5 was not antagonized by flumazenil (10 microM). These data show that piperine (5) represents a new scaffold of positive allosteric GABA(A) receptor modulators targeting a benzodiazepine-independent binding site.	0
Title: Formation of an Angular Aromatic Polyketide from a Linear Anthrene Precursor via Oxidative Rearrangement Abstract: Bacterial aromatic polyketides are a group of natural products synthesized by polyketide synthases (PKSs) that show diverse structures and biological activities. They are structurally subclassified into linear, angular, and discoid aromatic polyketides, the formation of which is commonly determined by the shaping and folding of the poly-β-keto intermediates under the concerted actions of the minimal PKSs, cyclases and ketoreductases. Murayaquinone, found in several streptomycetes, possesses an unusual tricyclic angular aromatic polyketide core containing a 9,10-phenanthraquinone. In this study, genes essential for murayaquinone biosynthesis were identified, and a linear anthraoxirene intermediate was discovered. A unique biosynthetic model for the angular aromatic polyketide formation was discovered and confirmed through in vivo and in vitro studies. Three oxidoreductases, MrqO3, MrqO6, and MrqO7, were identified to catalyze the conversion of the linear aromatic polyketide intermediate into the final angularly arranged framework, which exemplifies a novel strategy for the biosynthesis of angular aromatic polyketides.	1
Title: Direct and quantitative characterization of dynamic ligand exchange between coordination-driven self-assembled supramolecular polygons Abstract: The direct observation of dynamic ligand exchange between Pt-N coordination-driven self-assembled supramolecular polygons (triangles and rectangles) has been achieved using stable (1)H/(2)D isotope labeling of the pyridyl donors and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry combined with NMR spectroscopy. Both the thermodynamic and kinetic aspects of such exchange processes have been established on the basis of quantitative mass spectral results. Further investigation has shown that the exchange is highly dependent on experimental conditions such as temperature, solvent, and the counteranions.	0
Title: De novo generation of singlet oxygen and ammine ligands by photoactivation of a platinum anticancer complex Abstract: Worth the excitement: Highly reactive oxygen and nitrogen species are generated by photoactivation of the anticancer platinum(IV) complex trans,trans,trans-[Pt(N3 )2 (OH)2 (MA)(Py)] (MA=methylamine, Py=pyridine). Singlet oxygen is formed from the hydroxido ligands and not from dissolved oxygen, and ammine ligands are products from the conversion of azido ligands to nitrenes. Both processes can induce oxidation of guanine.	0
Title: Effects of P-glycoprotein and its inhibitors on apoptosis in K562 cells Abstract: P-glycoprotein (P-gp) is a major factor in multidrug resistance (MDR) which is a serious obstacle in chemotherapy. P-gp has also been implicated in causing apoptosis of tumor cells, which was shown to be another important mechanism of MDR recently. To study the influence of P-gp in tumor cell apoptosis, K562/A cells (P-gp+) and K562/S cells (P-gp-) were subjected to doxorubicin (Dox), serum withdrawal, or independent co-incubation with multiple P-gp inhibitors, including valspodar (PSC833), verapamil (Ver) and H108 to induce apoptosis. Apoptosis was simultaneously detected by apoptotic rate, cell cycle by flow cytometry and cysteine aspartic acid-specific protease 3 (caspase 3) activity by immunoassay. Cytotoxicity and apoptosis induced by PSC833 were evaluated through an MTT method and apoptosis rate, and cell cycle combined with caspase 3 activity, respectively. The results show that K562/A cells are more resistant to apoptosis and cell cycle arrest than K562/S cells after treatment with Dox or serum deprivation. The apoptosis of K562/A cells increased after co-incubation with each of the inhibitors of P-gp. P-gp inhibitors also enhanced cell cycle arrest in K562/A cell. PSC833 most strikingly decreased viability and led to apoptosis and S phase arrest of cell cycle in K562/A cells. Our study demonstrates that P-gp inhibits the apoptosis of tumor cells in addition to participating in the efflux of intracellular chemotherapy drugs. The results of the caspase 3 activity assay also suggest that the role of P-gp in apoptosis avoidance is caspase-related.	0
Title: Characterization of a novel, potent, and specific inhibitor of serine palmitoyltransferase Abstract: We have examined the mechanism of action of two natural products identified as broad spectrum antifungal agents (VanMiddlesworth, F., Dufresne, C., Wincott, F. E., Mosley, R. T., and Wilson, K. E. (1992) Tetrahedron Lett., in press; VanMiddlesworth, F., Giacobbe, R. A., Lopez, M. Garrity, G., Bland, J. A., Bartizal, K., Fromtling, R. A., Polishook, J., Zweerink, M. M., Edison, A. M., Rozdilsky, W., Wilson, K. E., and Monaghan, R. L. (1992) J. Antibiot. (Tokyo) 45, 861-867), designated sphingofungin B (2S-amino-3R,4R,5S,14-tetrahydroxyeicos-6-enoic acid) and sphingofungin C (2S-amino-5S-acetoxy-3R,4R,14-trihydroxyeicos-6-enoic acid), and find they are potent specific inhibitors of serine palmitoyltransferase, which catalyze the committed step of sphingolipid biosynthesis. We used Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model to investigate the mechanism of the antifungal activity of these compounds. Macromolecular synthesis was not immediately affected by either sphingofungin B or C, synthesis continued for 60-90 min following the addition of drug to growing cultures. Significant loss of viability with sphingofungins required growing cultures and began only after several hours, with greater than 99.9% of drug-treated cells non-viable after 24 h. No lysis or other gross changes in cell morphology were observed in drug-treated cells. The structural similarity of sphingofungin B and C to sphingosine and phytosphingosine prompted us to investigate their effects on sphingolipid synthesis. Nanomolar levels of the drugs inhibited the incorporation of [3H]inositol into sphingolipid before incorporation into the sphingolipid precursor, phosphatidylinositol was affected, suggesting specific inhibition of sphingolipid synthesis. This hypothesis was confirmed by experiments in which the growth inhibitory activity of both drugs was completely ablated by the addition of phytosphingosine, dihydrosphingosine, or ketodihydrosphingosine to the culture medium. Reversal of antifungal activity by ketodihydrosphingosine suggested that serine palmitoyltransferase could be the actual target of these compounds. Direct evidence for this hypothesis was the observation of inhibition of serine palmitoyltransferase activity in crude membrane preparations at nanomolar concentrations of each drug. The potent inhibition of serine palmitoyltransferase coupled with the apparent lack of effect of these compounds on other cellular functions suggests that sphingofungin B and C will prove to be important new tools for studying the role of sphingolipids in yeast and perhaps in other organisms.	0
Title: Organisation of the biosynthetic gene cluster for rapamycin in Streptomyces hygroscopicus: analysis of genes flanking the polyketide synthase Abstract: Analysis of the gene cluster from Streptomyces hygroscopicus that governs the biosynthesis of the polyketide immuno-suppressant rapamycin (Rp) has revealed that it contains three exceptionally large open reading frames (ORFs) encoding the modular polyketide synthase (PKS). Between two of these lies a fourth gene (rapP) encoding a pipecolate-incorporating enzyme that probably also catalyzes closure of the macrolide ring. On either side of these very large genes are ranged a total of 22 further ORFs before the limits of the cluster are reached, as judged by the identification of genes clearly encoding unrelated activities. Several of these ORFs appear to encode enzymes that would be required for Rp biosynthesis. These include two cytochrome P-450 monooxygenases (P450s), designated RapJ and RapN, an associated ferredoxin (Fd) RapO, and three potential SAM-dependent O-methyltransferases (MTases), RapI, RapM and RapQ. All of these are likely to be involved in 'late' modification of the macrocycle. The cluster also contains a novel gene (rapL) whose product is proposed to catalyze the formation of the Rp precursor, L-pipecolate, through the cyclodeamination of L-lysine. Adjacent genes have putative roles in Rp regulation and export. The codon usage of the PKS biosynthetic genes is markedly different from that of the flanking genes of the cluster.	1
Title: Structural and functional analysis of the gene cluster encoding the enzymes of the arginine deiminase pathway of Lactobacillus sake Abstract: Lactobacillus sake can use arginine via the arginine deiminase (ADI) pathway. We designed degenerate primers based on an alignment of known sequences of ornithine transcarbamoylase (OTC)-encoding genes in order to amplify the L. sake counterpart sequences by PCR. Screening a genomic library of L. sake in lambdaEMBL3 allowed us to isolate a clone containing a 10-kb L. sake genomic DNA insert. Sequence analysis revealed that the genes involved in arginine catabolism were clustered and encoded ADI (arcA), OTC (arcB), carbamate kinase (arcC), and a putative carrier with high similarity to the arginine/ornithine antiporter of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (arcD). Additionally, a putative transaminase-encoding gene (arcT) was located in this region. The genes followed the order arcA arcB arcC arcT arcD, which differs from that found in other microorganisms. arcA, arcB, arcC, and arcD mutants were constructed, and the ADI pathway was impaired in all of them. Transcriptional studies indicated that arcA gene is subject to catabolite repression, and under the conditions used, several transcripts could be detected, suggesting the existence of different initiation sites or processing of a larger mRNA.	0
Title: Multidomain structure and cellulosomal localization of the Clostridium thermocellum cellobiohydrolase CbhA Abstract: The nucleotide sequence of the Clostridium thermocellum F7 cbhA gene, coding for the cellobiohydrolase CbhA, has been determined. An open reading frame encoding a protein of 1,230 amino acids was identified. Removal of a putative signal peptide yields a mature protein of 1,203 amino acids with a molecular weight of 135,139. Sequence analysis of CbhA reveals a multidomain structure of unusual complexity consisting of an N-terminal cellulose binding domain (CBD) homologous to CBD family IV, an immunoglobulin-like beta-barrel domain, a catalytic domain homologous to cellulase family E1, a duplicated domain similar to fibronectin type III (Fn3) modules, a CBD homologous to family III, a highly acidic linker region, and a C-terminal dockerin domain. The cellulosomal localization of CbhA was confirmed by Western blot analysis employing polyclonal antibodies raised against a truncated enzymatically active version of CbhA. CbhA was identified as cellulosomal subunit S3 by partial amino acid sequence analysis. Comparison of the multidomain structures indicates striking similarities between CbhA and a group of cellulases from actinomycetes. Average linkage cluster analysis suggests a coevolution of the N-terminal CBD and the catalytic domain and its spread by horizontal gene transfer among gram-positive cellulolytic bacteria.	0
Title: The gene cluster aur1 for the angucycline antibiotic auricin is located on a large linear plasmid pSA3239 in Streptomyces aureofaciens CCM 3239 Abstract: We previously identified a polyketide synthase gene cluster, aur1, responsible for the production of the angucycline antibiotic auricin in Streptomyces aureofaciens CCM 3239. A sequence analysis of the aur1 flanking regions revealed the presence of several genes encoding proteins homologous to those for Streptomyces linear plasmid replication, partitioning and telomere-binding. Pulse-field gel electrophoresis detected the single, 240-kb linear plasmid, pSA3239, in S. aureofaciens CCM3239. The presence of the auricin cluster in pSA3239 was confirmed by several approaches. In addition to aur1, pSA3239 also carries a large number of regulatory genes, and two gene clusters involved in the production of secondary metabolites: the aur2 cluster for an unknown secondary metabolite and the bpsA cluster for the blue pigment indigoidine.	1
Title: Characterization of the interaction of the marine cyanobacterial natural product curacin A with the colchicine site of tubulin and initial structure-activity studies with analogues Abstract: Curacin A, the major lipid constituent of a strain of the marine cyanobacterium Lyngbya majuscula obtained off the coast of Curaçao, is a potent antimitotic agent that we have previously shown to inhibit microtubule assembly and colchicine binding to tubulin. In the present study, we report that curacin A probably binds in the colchicine site because it competitively inhibits the binding of [3H]colchicine to tubulin with an apparent Ki value of 0.6 microM and stimulates tubulin-dependent GTP hydrolysis, as do most other colchicine-site agents. The binding of curacin A to tubulin resembled the binding reactions of combretastatin A-4 and podophyllotoxin in contrast to that of colchicine in that it occurred as extensively on ice as at higher temperatures. However, once bound, the dissociation rate of curacin A from tubulin is very slow, more closely resembling that observed with colchicinoids (thiocolchicine was the drug examined) than the faster dissociation that occurs with combretastatin A-4 and podophyllotoxin. Because the molecular structure of curacin A is so different from that of previously described colchicine-site drugs (e.g., there is no aromatic moiety, and there are only two conjugated double bonds in its linear hydrocarbon chain), we have been examining the activities of natural isomers and synthetic derivatives. So far, only modest enhancement or reduction of activity has been observed with a variety of structural changes.	1
Title: Variacin, a new lanthionine-containing bacteriocin produced by Micrococcus varians: comparison to lacticin 481 of Lactococcus lactis Abstract: A new lanthionine-containing bacteriocin, variacin, displaying a broad host range of inhibition against gram-positive food spoilage bacteria, has been identified from two strains of Micrococcus varians isolated from meat fermentations. The new bacteriocin was purified, and its amino-terminal end and total amino acid composition were determined. The structural gene was isolated and analyzed. Variacin is resistant to heat and pH conditions from 2 to 10. Its primary sequence shows significant homology to lacticin 481 to Lactococcus lactis, which is more pronounced for the probacteriocin than for the leader sequence. Variacin, like lacticin 481, contains lanthionine and beta-methyllanthionine residues, but its leader sequence clearly resembles nonlantibiotic leader sequences. In particular, the prepeptide contains glycine residues at positions -1 and -2 of the processing site.	1
Title: Multidimensional glycan arrays for enhanced antibody profiling Abstract: Carbohydrate-binding antibodies play a critical role in basic and clinical research. Monoclonal antibodies that bind glycans are used to measure carbohydrate expression, and serum antibodies to glycans can be important elements of the immune response to pathogens and vaccines. Carbohydrate antigen arrays, or glycan arrays, have emerged as powerful tools for the high-throughput analysis of carbohydrate-protein interactions. Our group has focused on the development and application of neoglycoprotein arrays, a unique array format wherein carbohydrates are covalently attached to a carrier protein prior to immobilization on the surface. The neoglycoprotein format permits variations of glycan structure, glycan density, and neoglycoprotein density on a single array. The focus of this study was on the effects of neoglycoprotein density on antibody binding. First, we evaluated binding of five monoclonal antibodies (81FR2.2, HE-195, HE-193, B480, and Z2A) to the blood group A antigen and found that neoglycoprotein density had a substantial effect on recognition. Next, we profiled serum antibodies in 15 healthy individuals and showed that inclusion of multiple neoglycoprotein densities helps distinguish different subpopulations of antibodies. Finally, we evaluated immune responses induced by a prostate cancer vaccine and showed that variations in neoglycoprotein density enable one to detect antibody responses that could not be detected otherwise. Neoglycoprotein density is a useful element of diversity for evaluating antibody recognition and, when combined with variations in glycan structure and glycan density, provides multidimensional glycan arrays with enhanced performance for monoclonal antibody development, biomarker discovery, and vaccine optimization.	0
Title: Supramolecular Assembly of Halide Perovskite Building Blocks Abstract: The structural diversity and tunable optoelectronic properties of halide perovskites originate from the rich chemistry of the metal halide ionic octahedron [MX6]n- (M = Pb2+, Sb3+, Te4+, Sn4+, Pt4+, etc.; X = Cl-, Br-, and I-). The properties of the extended perovskite solids are dictated by the assembly, connectivity, and interaction of these octahedra within the lattice environment. Hence, the ability to manipulate and control the assembly of the octahedral building blocks is paramount for constructing new perovskite materials. Here, we propose a systematic supramolecular strategy for the assembly of [MX6]n- octahedra into a solid extended network. Interaction of alkali metal-bound crown ethers with the [M(IV)X6]2- octahedron resulted in a structurally and optoelectronically tunable "dumbbell" structural unit in solution. Single crystals with diverse packing geometries and symmetries will form as the solid assembly of this new supramolecular building block. This supramolecular assembly route introduces a new general strategy for designing halide perovskite structures with potentially new optoelectronic properties.	0
Title: Brucella abortus depends on pyruvate phosphate dikinase and malic enzyme but not on Fbp and GlpX fructose-1,6-bisphosphatases for full virulence in laboratory models Abstract: The brucellae are the etiological agents of brucellosis, a worldwide-distributed zoonosis. These bacteria are facultative intracellular parasites and thus are able to adjust their metabolism to the extra- and intracellular environments encountered during an infectious cycle. However, this aspect of Brucella biology is imperfectly understood, and the nutrients available in the intracellular niche are unknown. Here, we investigated the central pathways of C metabolism used by Brucella abortus by deleting the putative fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (fbp and glpX), phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (pckA), pyruvate phosphate dikinase (ppdK), and malic enzyme (mae) genes. In gluconeogenic but not in rich media, growth of ΔppdK and Δmae mutants was severely impaired and growth of the double Δfbp-ΔglpX mutant was reduced. In macrophages, only the ΔppdK and Δmae mutants showed reduced multiplication, and studies with the ΔppdK mutant confirmed that it reached the replicative niche. Similarly, only the ΔppdK and Δmae mutants were attenuated in mice, the former being cleared by week 10 and the latter persisting longer than 12 weeks. We also investigated the glyoxylate cycle. Although aceA (isocitrate lyase) promoter activity was enhanced in rich medium, aceA disruption had no effect in vitro or on multiplication in macrophages or mouse spleens. The results suggest that B. abortus grows intracellularly using a limited supply of 6-C (and 5-C) sugars that is compensated by glutamate and possibly other amino acids entering the Krebs cycle without a critical role of the glyoxylate shunt.	0
Title: Pseudilins: halogenated, allosteric inhibitors of the non-mevalonate pathway enzyme IspD Abstract: The enzymes of the non-mevalonate pathway for isoprenoid biosynthesis have been identified as attractive targets with novel modes of action for the development of herbicides for crop protection and agents against infectious diseases. This pathway is present in many pathogenic organisms and plants, but absent in mammals. By using high-throughput screening, we identified highly halogenated marine natural products, the pseudilins, to be inhibitors of the third enzyme, IspD, in the pathway. Their activity against the IspD enzymes from Arabidopsis thaliana and Plasmodium vivax was determined in photometric and NMR-based assays. Cocrystal structures revealed that pseudilins bind to an allosteric pocket by using both divalent metal ion coordination and halogen bonding. The allosteric mode of action for preventing cosubstrate (CTP) binding at the active site was elucidated. Pseudilins show herbicidal activity in plant assays and antiplasmodial activity in cell-based assays.	1
Title: Characterization of cyanobacterial hydrocarbon composition and distribution of biosynthetic pathways Abstract: Cyanobacteria possess the unique capacity to naturally produce hydrocarbons from fatty acids. Hydrocarbon compositions of thirty-two strains of cyanobacteria were characterized to reveal novel structural features and insights into hydrocarbon biosynthesis in cyanobacteria. This investigation revealed new double bond (2- and 3-heptadecene) and methyl group positions (3-, 4- and 5-methylheptadecane) for a variety of strains. Additionally, results from this study and literature reports indicate that hydrocarbon production is a universal phenomenon in cyanobacteria. All cyanobacteria possess the capacity to produce hydrocarbons from fatty acids yet not all accomplish this through the same metabolic pathway. One pathway comprises a two-step conversion of fatty acids first to fatty aldehydes and then alkanes that involves a fatty acyl ACP reductase (FAAR) and aldehyde deformylating oxygenase (ADO). The second involves a polyketide synthase (PKS) pathway that first elongates the acyl chain followed by decarboxylation to produce a terminal alkene (olefin synthase, OLS). Sixty-one strains possessing the FAAR/ADO pathway and twelve strains possessing the OLS pathway were newly identified through bioinformatic analyses. Strains possessing the OLS pathway formed a cohesive phylogenetic clade with the exception of three Moorea strains and Leptolyngbya sp. PCC 6406 which may have acquired the OLS pathway via horizontal gene transfer. Hydrocarbon pathways were identified in one-hundred-forty-two strains of cyanobacteria over a broad phylogenetic range and there were no instances where both the FAAR/ADO and the OLS pathways were found together in the same genome, suggesting an unknown selective pressure maintains one or the other pathway, but not both.	1
Title: Emerimicins V-X, 15-Residue Peptaibols Discovered from an Acremonium sp. through Integrated Genomic and Chemical Approaches Abstract: Fermentation of Acremonium tubakii W. Gams isolated from a soil sample collected from the University of Utah led to the isolation and characterization of six new linear pentadecapeptides, emerimicins V-X (1-6). Peptaibols containing 15-residues are quite rare, with only 22 reported. Genome mining and bioinformatic analysis were used to identify the emerimicin 60 kbp eme biosynthetic cluster harboring a single 16-module hybrid polyketide-nonribosomal peptide synthetase. A detailed bioinformatic investigation of the corresponding 15 adenylation domains, combined with 1D and 2D NMR experiments, LC-MS/MS data, and advanced Marfey's method, allowed for the elucidation and absolute configuration of all proteinogenic and nonproteinogenic amino acid residues in 1-6. As some peptaibols possess cytotoxic activity, a zebrafish embryotoxicity assay was used to evaluate the toxicity of the six emerimicins and showed that emerimicin V (1) and VI (2) exhibit the most potent activity. Additionally, out of the six emerimicins, 1 displayed modest activity against Enterococcus faecalis, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium with MIC values of 64, 32, and 64 μg/mL, respectively.	1
Title: Identification and characterization of two contiguous operons required for aerobactin transport and biosynthesis in Vibrio mimicus Abstract: In response to iron deprivation, Vibrio mimicus produces aerobactin as a major siderophore. Application of the Fur titration assay to a V. mimicus genomic DNA library followed by further cloning of the surrounding regions led to the identification of two adjacent, iron-regulated operons. One contains three genes encoding homologs of the Escherichia coli FhuCDB and the other, five genes encoding homologs of the E. coli IucABCD IutA. Construction of the V. mimicus polar disruptants in the respective operons allowed us to confirm their functions. The genetic arrangement of the aerobactin-mediated iron acquisition system in V. mimicus is unique in that the aerobactin operon (iucABCD iutA ) is contiguous to the operon (matCDB ) encoding components of an ATP-binding cassette transport system for ferric aerobactin. This is the first report demonstrating that aerobactin transport and biosynthesis genes are present in a species outside the family Enterobacteriaceae.	1
Title: Yeast homologous recombination-based promoter engineering for the activation of silent natural product biosynthetic gene clusters Abstract: Large-scale sequencing of prokaryotic (meta)genomic DNA suggests that most bacterial natural product gene clusters are not expressed under common laboratory culture conditions. Silent gene clusters represent a promising resource for natural product discovery and the development of a new generation of therapeutics. Unfortunately, the characterization of molecules encoded by these clusters is hampered owing to our inability to express these gene clusters in the laboratory. To address this bottleneck, we have developed a promoter-engineering platform to transcriptionally activate silent gene clusters in a model heterologous host. Our approach uses yeast homologous recombination, an auxotrophy complementation-based yeast selection system and sequence orthogonal promoter cassettes to exchange all native promoters in silent gene clusters with constitutively active promoters. As part of this platform, we constructed and validated a set of bidirectional promoter cassettes consisting of orthogonal promoter sequences, Streptomyces ribosome binding sites, and yeast selectable marker genes. Using these tools we demonstrate the ability to simultaneously insert multiple promoter cassettes into a gene cluster, thereby expediting the reengineering process. We apply this method to model active and silent gene clusters (rebeccamycin and tetarimycin) and to the silent, cryptic pseudogene-containing, environmental DNA-derived Lzr gene cluster. Complete promoter refactoring and targeted gene exchange in this "dead" cluster led to the discovery of potent indolotryptoline antiproliferative agents, lazarimides A and B. This potentially scalable and cost-effective promoter reengineering platform should streamline the discovery of natural products from silent natural product biosynthetic gene clusters.	1
Title: Multiple site-selective insertions of noncanonical amino acids into sequence-repetitive polypeptides Abstract: A simple and efficient method is described for the introduction of noncanonical amino acids at multiple, defined sites within recombinant polypeptide sequences. Escherichia coli MRA30, a bacterial host strain with attenuated activity of release factor 1 (RF1), was assessed for its ability to support incorporation of a diverse range of noncanonical amino acids in response to multiple encoded amber (TAG) codons within genes derived from superfolder GFP and an elastin-mimetic protein polymer. Suppression efficiency and protein yield depended on the identity of the orthogonal aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase/tRNA(CUA) pair and the noncanonical amino acid. Elastin-mimetic protein polymers were prepared in which noncanonical amino acid derivatives were incorporated at up to 22 specific sites within the polypeptide sequence with high substitution efficiency. The identities and positions of the variant residues were confirmed by mass spectrometric analysis of the full-length polypeptides and proteolytic cleavage fragments from thermolysin digestion. The data suggest that this multisite suppression approach permits the preparation of protein-based materials in which novel chemical functionalities can be introduced at precisely defined positions within the polypeptide sequence.	0
Title: Mitochondrial D-loop sequences are integrated in the rat nuclear genome Abstract: We have cloned two fragments of rat nuclear DNA (nucDNA), 3.3 x 10(3) nucleotide-pairs (knp) and 9.1 knp, that contain a 0.5 knp section sharing 80% sequence identity with the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) heavy strand origin of replication (D-loop) nascent strand and 88% identity with each other. The light and heavy strand promoters of the D-loop region are not present in either clone, thus they likely do not function as replication origins in the nuclear genome. The nucDNA sequences surrounding the mtDNA-like sequences are not mitochondrial, thus the mtDNA-like sequences are demonstrably covalently linked in the nuclear genome. Indeed, the surrounding nuclear sequences of each clone also share 88% identity. This sequence arrangement strongly suggests an initial insertion of mtDNA into nucDNA with subsequent amplification of an encompassing region of nucDNA. Divergence calculations suggest that the mtDNA insertion occurred around 13.6 million years ago (MYA) with the subsequent separation occurring around 6.5 MYA. The mtDNA-like sequences of the nuclear clones hybridize strongly to a number of different BamHI-PstI restriction fragments, suggesting either repeated integration and/or frequent mutational events producing new restriction enzyme sites. It is not yet known if one or more of the uncloned D-loop-like sequences are associated with promoters, which would suggest possible function. The 3.3 knp nucDNA fragment is present in low copy number. In contrast, the 9.1 knp nucDNA fragment appears to be moderately repeated. The elements do not appear to be tandemly repeated. The nucDNA clones contain remnants of rat long interspersed repetitive element (LINE) sequences; in addition the 9.1 knp fragment contains sequences with similarity to portions of viral reverse transcriptase and RNaseH genes. Until now, all mtDNA-like sequences found in the nuclear genome have been coding sequences. This is the first confirmation by sequence analysis of a portion of the mtDNA control region in the nuclear genome.	0
Title: Plantaricyclin A, a Novel Circular Bacteriocin Produced by Lactobacillus plantarum NI326: Purification, Characterization, and Heterologous Production Abstract: Bacteriocins from lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are of increasing interest in recent years due to their potential as natural preservatives against food and beverage spoilage microorganisms. In a screening study for LAB, we isolated from olives a strain, Lactobacillus plantarum NI326, with activity against the beverage-spoilage bacterium Alicyclobacillus acidoterrestris Genome sequencing of NI326 enabled the identification of a gene cluster (designated plc) encoding a putative circular bacteriocin and proteins involved in its modification, transport, and immunity. This novel bacteriocin, named plantaricyclin A (PlcA), was grouped into the circular bacteriocin subgroup II due to its high degree of similarity with other gassericin A-like bacteriocins. Purification of PlcA from the supernatant of Lb. plantarum NI326 resulted in an active peptide with a molecular mass of 5,570 Da, corresponding to that predicted from the (processed) PlcA amino acid sequence. The plc gene cluster was cloned and expressed in Lactococcus lactis NZ9000, resulting in the production of an active 5,570-Da bacteriocin in the supernatant. PlcA is believed to be produced as a 91-amino-acid precursor with a 33-amino-acid leader peptide, which is predicted to be removed, followed by joining of the N and C termini via a covalent linkage to form the mature 58-amino-acid circular bacteriocin PlcA. We report the characterization of a circular bacteriocin produced by Lb. plantarum The inhibition displayed against A. acidoterrestris highlights its potential use as a preservative in food and beverages.IMPORTANCE In this work, we describe the purification and characterization of an antimicrobial peptide, termed plantaricyclin A (PlcA), produced by a Lactobacillus plantarum strain isolated from olives. This peptide has a circular structure, and all genes involved in its production, circularization, and secretion were identified. PlcA shows antimicrobial activity against different strains, including Alicyclobacillus acidoterrestris, a common spoilage bacterium, which causes substantial economic losses in the beverage industry every year. In this study, we describe a circular antimicrobial peptide, PlcA, for a Lactobacillus plantarum strain.	1
Title: Characterization and analysis of the regulatory network involved in control of lipomycin biosynthesis in Streptomyces aureofaciens Tü117 Abstract: Analysis of the alpha-lipomycin biosynthesis gene cluster of Streptomyces aureofaciens Tü117 led to the identification of five putative regulatory genes, which are congregated into a subcluster. Analysis of the lipReg1-4 and lipX1 showed that they encode components of two-component signal transduction systems (LipReg1 and LipReg2), multiple antibiotics resistance-type regulator (LipReg3), large ATP-binding regulators of the LuxR family-type regulator (LipReg4), and small ribonuclease (LipRegX1), respectively. A combination of targeted gene disruptions, complementation experiments, lipomycin production studies, and gene expression analysis via RT-PCR suggests that all regulatory lip genes are involved in alpha-lipomycin production. On the basis of the obtained data, we propose that LipReg2 controls the activity of LipReg1, which in its turn govern the expression of the alpha-lipomycin pathway-specific regulatory gene lipReg4. The ribonuclease gene lipX1 and the transporter regulator lipReg3 appear to work independently of genes lipReg1, lipReg2, and lipReg4.	1
Title: Genome Mining of Marine-Derived Streptomyces sp. SCSIO 40010 Leads to Cytotoxic New Polycyclic Tetramate Macrolactams Abstract: Polycyclic tetramate macrolactams (PTMs) biosynthetic gene cluster are widely distributed in different bacterial types, especially in Streptomyces species. The mining of the genomic data of marine-derived Streptomyces sp. SCSIO 40010 reveals the presence of a putative PTM-encoding biosynthetic gene cluster (ptm' BGC) that features a genetic organization for potentially producing 5/5/6 type of carbocyclic ring-containing PTMs. A fermentation of Streptomyces sp. SCSIO 40010 led to the isolation and characterization of six new PTMs 1-6. Comprehensive spectroscopic analysis assigned their planar structures and relative configurations, and their absolute configurations were deduced by comparing the experimental electronic circular dichroism (ECD) spectra with the reported spectra of the known PTMs. Intriguingly, compounds 1-6 were determined to have a trans-orientation of H-10/H-11 at the first 5-membered ring, being distinct from the cis-orientation in their known PTM congeners. PTMs 1-5 displayed cytotoxicity against several cancer cell lines, with IC50 values that ranged from 2.47 to 17.68 µM.	1
Title: The role of cell type-specific responses in IFN-β therapy of multiple sclerosis Abstract: The mechanism of IFN-β therapy in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) is not well understood, but induction of apoptosis in specific leukocyte subsets is likely to be important. Enhanced expression of TNFSF10 or TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) mRNA in unseparated leukocytes has been put forward as a therapeutic response marker, but it is unclear which leukocyte subsets express TRAIL. We investigated the basis of TRAIL expression in response to IFN-β by studying activation of STATs 1, 3, and 5, p38 MAPK, and NF-κB in different leukocyte subsets of patients with RRMS. Monocytes, B cells, and T cells showed substantial differences in the activation of p38 and the STATs in response to i.m. injection of IFN-β1a or stimulation in vitro. Induction of cell-surface TRAIL, analyzed in nine leukocyte subsets, was observed only on monocytes and granulocytes and correlated with the activation of p38 and/or NF-κB in these subsets only, in agreement with previous work in fibroblasts showing that the induction of TRAIL in response to IFN-β depends on the activation of p38 and NF-κB as well as STATs 1 and 2. We propose that, in myeloid cells, the differential activation of p38 and NF-κB and induction of TRAIL, which sensitizes cells to apoptosis, can help to explain differences in responsiveness to IFN-β therapy among patients with RRMS and, furthermore, that such differential patterns of activation and expression may also be important in understanding the therapeutic responses to IFN-α/β in hepatitis and cancer.	0
Title: Production of a Novel Amide-Containing Polyene by Activating a Cryptic Biosynthetic Gene Cluster in Streptomyces sp. MSC090213JE08 Abstract: Streptomyces sp. MSC090213JE08 seems to have more than 20 cryptic biosynthetic gene clusters for secondary metabolites. We aimed to activate some of them by forced production of Streptomyces antibiotic regulatory protein (SARP) family transcriptional activators. We constructed seven recombinant strains, each of which contained a SARP gene under the control of a constitutive promoter, and subjected them to comparative metabolic profiling analysis. Four of the seven strains produced nine metabolites that were hardly detected in the control strains. We isolated a new metabolite (named ishigamide) from the SARP-7-expressing strain and determined its structure as 3-((2E,4E,6E,8E)-13-hydroxytetradeca-2,4,6,8-tetraenamido)propanoic acid. Genome scanning and gene disruption studies identified the ishigamide biosynthetic gene cluster adjacent to the SARP-7 gene. We think that a new subfamily of type II polyketide synthase is involved in the biosynthesis of the polyene structure of ishigamide.	1
Title: RNAi screen identifies Brd4 as a therapeutic target in acute myeloid leukaemia Abstract: Epigenetic pathways can regulate gene expression by controlling and interpreting chromatin modifications. Cancer cells are characterized by altered epigenetic landscapes, and commonly exploit the chromatin regulatory machinery to enforce oncogenic gene expression programs. Although chromatin alterations are, in principle, reversible and often amenable to drug intervention, the promise of targeting such pathways therapeutically has been limited by an incomplete understanding of cancer-specific dependencies on epigenetic regulators. Here we describe a non-biased approach to probe epigenetic vulnerabilities in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), an aggressive haematopoietic malignancy that is often associated with aberrant chromatin states. By screening a custom library of small hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) targeting known chromatin regulators in a genetically defined AML mouse model, we identify the protein bromodomain-containing 4 (Brd4) as being critically required for disease maintenance. Suppression of Brd4 using shRNAs or the small-molecule inhibitor JQ1 led to robust antileukaemic effects in vitro and in vivo, accompanied by terminal myeloid differentiation and elimination of leukaemia stem cells. Similar sensitivities were observed in a variety of human AML cell lines and primary patient samples, revealing that JQ1 has broad activity in diverse AML subtypes. The effects of Brd4 suppression are, at least in part, due to its role in sustaining Myc expression to promote aberrant self-renewal, which implicates JQ1 as a pharmacological means to suppress MYC in cancer. Our results establish small-molecule inhibition of Brd4 as a promising therapeutic strategy in AML and, potentially, other cancers, and highlight the utility of RNA interference (RNAi) screening for revealing epigenetic vulnerabilities that can be exploited for direct pharmacological intervention.	0
Title: Studies on monocyclic beta-lactam antibiotics. II. Synthesis and antibacterial activity of 3-acylamino-2-azetidinone-1-oxysulfonic acids Abstract: The synthesis and in vitro antibacterial and beta-lactamase inhibitory activity of the 2-azetidinone-1-oxysulfonic acids having a substituent at C-4 position of the beta-lactam ring are described. The influence of C-4 substituents on the antibacterial activity was examined for the compounds having alpha-ureidoacetyl or alpha-oxyiminoacetyl group as acyl side chain at C-3 position. The antibacterial activity is correlated with the C-4 substituents and acyl side chain. Especially, 4(R)-methyl substituted derivatives exhibited excellent activity against Gram-negative bacteria and 4-dimethyl substituted derivatives exhibited strong activity against resistant Gram-negative bacteria except for Pseudomonas aeruginosa. 39 and 40 showed strong inhibitory activity against cephalosporinase of Enterobacter cloacae H-27.	0
Title: Characterization of the polyoxin biosynthetic gene cluster from Streptomyces cacaoi and engineered production of polyoxin H Abstract: A gene cluster (pol) essential for the biosynthesis of polyoxin, a nucleoside antibiotic widely used for the control of phytopathogenic fungi, was cloned from Streptomyces cacaoi. A 46,066-bp region was sequenced, and 20 of 39 of the putative open reading frames were defined as necessary for polyoxin biosynthesis as evidenced by its production in a heterologous host, Streptomyces lividans TK24. The role of PolO and PolA in polyoxin synthesis was demonstrated by in vivo experiments, and their functions were unambiguously characterized as O-carbamoyltransferase and UMP-enolpyruvyltransferase, respectively, by in vitro experiments, which enabled the production of a modified compound differing slightly from that proposed earlier. These studies should provide a solid foundation for the elucidation of the molecular mechanisms for polyoxin biosynthesis, and set the stage for combinatorial biosynthesis using genes encoding different pathways for nucleoside antibiotics.	1
Title: Chromosome replication in Myxococcus xanthus Abstract: The rates of DNA synthesis during the cell-division cycle were measured in Myxococcus xanthus growing in three different media permitting a twofold variation in doubling time. In all three media, simple DNA cycles were observed. Synthesis of DNA occurred during 85% of the cell-division cycle, independent of generation time, from 5 to 11 h. Cells were observed to contain one bacterial nucleoid at birth that later divided synchronously midway through the cell cycle. Nucleoid segregation appeared to begin before chromosome replication was completed. The DNA content of exponential-phase bacteria was determined to be about 20 +/- 3 X 10(-9) microgram per cell; newborn bacteria contained about 14 +/- 2 X 10(-9) microgram of DNA per cell. Exponential-phase bacteria showed about a 50% increase in DNA in the presence of chloramphenicol (50 microgram/ml). The number of randomly segregating chromosomes present in exponential-phase bacteria was determined by following the fate of prelabeled DNA during outgrowth in nonradioactive media. The results are consistent with a model in which cells are born with exactly one complete unreplicated chromosome. The molecular weight of such a chromosome is about 8.4 +/- 1.2 X 10(9).	0
Title: Transcriptional analysis of the jamaicamide gene cluster from the marine cyanobacterium Lyngbya majuscula and identification of possible regulatory proteins Abstract: Background:                       The marine cyanobacterium Lyngbya majuscula is a prolific producer of bioactive secondary metabolites. Although biosynthetic gene clusters encoding several of these compounds have been identified, little is known about how these clusters of genes are transcribed or regulated, and techniques targeting genetic manipulation in Lyngbya strains have not yet been developed. We conducted transcriptional analyses of the jamaicamide gene cluster from a Jamaican strain of Lyngbya majuscula, and isolated proteins that could be involved in jamaicamide regulation.                  Results:                       An unusually long untranslated leader region of approximately 840 bp is located between the jamaicamide transcription start site (TSS) and gene cluster start codon. All of the intergenic regions between the pathway ORFs were transcribed into RNA in RT-PCR experiments; however, a promoter prediction program indicated the possible presence of promoters in multiple intergenic regions. Because the functionality of these promoters could not be verified in vivo, we used a reporter gene assay in E. coli to show that several of these intergenic regions, as well as the primary promoter preceding the TSS, are capable of driving beta-galactosidase production. A protein pulldown assay was also used to isolate proteins that may regulate the jamaicamide pathway. Pulldown experiments using the intergenic region upstream of jamA as a DNA probe isolated two proteins that were identified by LC-MS/MS. By BLAST analysis, one of these had close sequence identity to a regulatory protein in another cyanobacterial species. Protein comparisons suggest a possible correlation between secondary metabolism regulation and light dependent complementary chromatic adaptation. Electromobility shift assays were used to evaluate binding of the recombinant proteins to the jamaicamide promoter region.                  Conclusion:                       Insights into natural product regulation in cyanobacteria are of significant value to drug discovery and biotechnology. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to characterize the transcription and regulation of secondary metabolism in a marine cyanobacterium. If jamaicamide is light regulated, this mechanism would be similar to other cyanobacterial natural product gene clusters such as microcystin LR. These findings could aid in understanding and potentially assisting the management of toxin production by Lyngbya in the environment.	1
Title: Biosynthesis-assisted structural elucidation of the bartolosides, chlorinated aromatic glycolipids from cyanobacteria Abstract: The isolation of the bartolosides, unprecedented cyanobacterial glycolipids featuring aliphatic chains with chlorine substituents and C-glycosyl moieties, is reported. Their chlorinated dialkylresorcinol (DAR) core presented a major structural-elucidation challenge. To overcome this, we discovered the bartoloside (brt) biosynthetic gene cluster and linked it to the natural products through in vitro characterization of the DAR-forming ketosynthase and aromatase. Bioinformatic analysis also revealed a novel potential halogenase. Knowledge of the bartoloside biosynthesis constrained the DAR core structure by defining key pathway intermediates, ultimately allowing us to determine the full structures of the bartolosides. This work illustrates the power of genomics to enable the use of biosynthetic information for structure elucidation.	1
Title: Isolation and purification of a new kalimantacin/batumin-related polyketide antibiotic and elucidation of its biosynthesis gene cluster Abstract: Kal/bat, a polyketide, isolated to high purity (>95%) is characterized by strong and selective antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus species (minimum inhibitory concentration, 0.05 microg/mL), and no resistance was observed in strains already resistant to commonly used antibiotics. The kal/bat biosynthesis gene cluster was determined to a 62 kb genomic region of Pseudomonas fluorescens BCCM_ID9359. The kal/bat gene cluster consists of 16 open reading frames (ORF), encoding a hybrid PKS-NRPS system, extended with trans-acting tailoring functions. A full model for kal/bat biosynthesis is postulated and experimentally tested by gene inactivation, structural confirmation (using NMR spectroscopy), and complementation. The structural and microbiological study of biosynthetic kal/bat analogs revealed the importance of the carbamoyl group and 17-keto group for antibacterial activity. The mechanism of self-resistance lies within the production of an inactive intermediate, which is activated in a one-step enzymatic oxidation upon export. The genetic basis and biochemical elucidation of the biosynthesis pathway of this antibiotic will facilitate rational engineering for the design of novel structures with improved activities. This makes it a promising new therapeutic option to cope with multidrug-resistant clinical infections.	1
Title: Functional Analysis of Genes Involved in the Biosynthesis of Enterocin NKR-5-3B, a Novel Circular Bacteriocin Abstract: A putative biosynthetic gene cluster of the enterocin NKR-5-3B (Ent53B), a novel circular bacteriocin, was analyzed by sequencing the flanking regions around enkB, the Ent53B structural gene, using a fosmid library. A region approximately 9 kb in length was obtained, and the enkB1, enkB2, enkB3, and enkB4 genes, encoding putative biosynthetic proteins involved in the production, maturation, and secretion of Ent53B, were identified. We also determined the identity of proteins mediating self-immunity against the effects of Ent53B. Heterologous expression systems in various heterologous hosts, such as Enterococcus faecalis and Lactococcus lactis strains, were successfully established. The production and secretion of the mature Ent53B required the cooperative functions of five genes. Ent53B was produced only by those heterologous hosts that expressed protein products of the enkB, enkB1, enkB2, enkB3, and enkB4 genes. Moreover, self-immunity against the antimicrobial action of Ent53B was conferred by at least two independent mechanisms. Heterologous hosts harboring the intact enkB4 gene and/or a combination of intact enkB1 and enkB3 genes were immune to the inhibitory action of Ent53B.                  Importance:                       In addition to their potential application as food preservatives, circular bacteriocins are now considered possible alternatives to therapeutic antibiotics due to the exceptional stability conferred by their circular structure. The successful practical application of circular bacteriocins will become possible only if the molecular details of their biosynthesis are fully understood. The results of the present study offer a new perspective on the possible mechanism of circular bacteriocin biosynthesis. In addition, since some enterococcal strains are associated with pathogenicity, virulence, and drug resistance, the establishment of the first multigenus host heterologous production of Ent53B has very high practical significance, as it widens the scope of possible Ent53B applications.	1
Title: Cloning, sequencing, and characterization of the pradimicin biosynthetic gene cluster of Actinomadura hibisca P157-2 Abstract: Pradimicins are potent antifungal antibiotics having an unusual dihydrobenzo[alpha]naphthacenequinone aglycone substituted with D-alanine and sugars. Pradimicins are polyketide antibiotics produced by Actinomadura hibisca P157-2. The gene cluster involved in the biosynthesis of pradimicins was cloned and sequenced. The pradimicin gene cluster was localized to a 39-kb DNA segment and its involvement in the biosynthesis of pradimicin was proven by gene inactivation of prmA and prmB (ketosynthases alpha and beta). The pradimicin gene cluster consists of 28 open reading frames (ORFs), encoding a type II polyketide synthase (PKS), the enzymes involved in sugar biosynthesis and tailoring enzymes as well as two resistance proteins. The deduced proteins showed strong similarities to the previously validated gene clusters of angucyclic polyketides such as rubromycin, griseorhodin, and fredericamycin. From the pradimicin gene cluster, prmP3 encoding a component of the acetyl-CoA carboxylase complex was disrupted. The production levels of pradimicins of the resulting mutants decreased to 62% of the level produced by the wild-type strain, which indicate that the acetyl-CoA carboxylase gene would have a significant role in the production of pradimicins through supplying the extender unit precursor, malonyl-CoA.	1
Title: A type I/type III polyketide synthase hybrid biosynthetic pathway for the structurally unique ansa compound kendomycin Abstract: Kendomycin is a bioactive polyketide that is produced by various Streptomyces strains. It displays strong antibiotic activities against a wide range of bacteria and exhibits remarkable cytotoxic effects on the growth of several human cancer cell lines. In this study we cloned the corresponding biosynthetic locus from the producer Streptomyces violaceoruber (strain 3844-33C). Our analysis shows that a mixed type I/type III polyketide synthase pathway is responsible for the formation of the fully carbogenic macrocyclic scaffold of kendomycin, which is unprecedented among all of the ansa compounds that have been isolated so far. Heterologous expression of a gene set in Streptomyces coelicolor shows that 3,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid is an intermediate in the starter unit biosynthesis that is initiated by the type III polyketide synthase. The identification of the kendomycin biosynthetic gene cluster sets the stage to study a novel chain termination mechanism by a type I PKS that leads to carbocycle formation and provides the starting material for the heterologous expression of the entire pathway, and the production of novel derivatives by genetic engineering.	1
Title: Cloning and characterization of the biosynthetic gene cluster of 16-membered macrolide antibiotic FD-891: involvement of a dual functional cytochrome P450 monooxygenase catalyzing epoxidation and hydroxylation Abstract: FD-891 is a 16-membered cytotoxic antibiotic macrolide that is especially active against human leukemia such as HL-60 and Jurkat cells. We identified the FD-891 biosynthetic (gfs) gene cluster from the producer Streptomyces graminofaciens A-8890 by using typical modular type I polyketide synthase (PKS) genes as probes. The gfs gene cluster contained five typical modular type I PKS genes (gfsA, B, C, D, and E), a cytochrome P450 gene (gfsF), a methyltransferase gene (gfsG), and a regulator gene (gfsR). The gene organization of PKSs agreed well with the basic polyketide skeleton of FD-891 including the oxidation states and alpha-alkyl substituent determined by the substrate specificities of the acyltransferase (AT) domains. To clarify the involvement of the gfs genes in the FD-891 biosynthesis, the P450 gfsF gene was inactivated; this resulted in the loss of FD-891 production. Instead, the gfsF gene-disrupted mutant accumulated a novel FD-891 analogue 25-O-methyl-FD-892, which lacked the epoxide and the hydroxyl group of FD-891. Furthermore, the recombinant GfsF enzyme coexpressed with putidaredoxin and putidaredoxin reductase converted 25-O-methyl-FD-892 into FD-891. In the course of the GfsF reaction, 10-deoxy-FD-891 was isolated as an enzymatic reaction intermediate, which was also converted into FD-891 by GfsF. Therefore, it was clearly found that the cytochrome P450 GfsF catalyzes epoxidation and hydroxylation in a stepwise manner in the FD-891 biosynthesis. These results clearly confirmed that the identified gfs genes are responsible for the biosynthesis of FD-891 in S. graminofaciens.	1
Title: Cloning, sequencing, and characterization of the iturin A operon Abstract: Bacillus subtilis RB14 is a producer of the antifungal lipopeptide iturin A. Using a transposon, we identified and cloned the iturin A synthetase operon of RB14, and the sequence of this operon was also determined. The iturin A operon spans a region that is more than 38 kb long and is composed of four open reading frames, ituD, ituA, ituB, and ituC. The ituD gene encodes a putative malonyl coenzyme A transacylase, whose disruption results in a specific deficiency in iturin A production. The second gene, ituA, encodes a 449-kDa protein that has three functional modules homologous to fatty acid synthetase, amino acid transferase, and peptide synthetase. The third gene, ituB, and the fourth gene, ituC, encode 609- and 297-kDa peptide synthetases that harbor four and two amino acid modules, respectively. Mycosubtilin, which is produced by B. subtilis ATCC 6633, has almost the same structure as iturin A, but the amino acids at positions 6 and 7 in the mycosubtilin sequence are D-Ser-->L-Asn, while in iturin A these amino acids are inverted (i.e., D-Asn-->L-Ser). Comparison of the amino acid sequences encoded by the iturin A operon and the mycosubtilin operon revealed that ituD, ituA, and ituB have high levels of homology to the counterpart genes fenF (79%), mycA (79%), and mycB (79%), respectively. Although the overall level of homology of the amino acid sequences encoded by ituC and mycC, the counterpart of ituC, is relatively low (64%), which indicates that there is a difference in the amino acid sequences of the two lipopeptides, the levels of homology between the putative serine adenylation domains and between the asparagine adenylation domains in the two synthetases are high (79 and 80%, respectively), implying that there is an intragenic domain change in the synthetases. The fact that the flanking sequence of the iturin A synthetase coding region was highly homologous to the flanking sequence that of xynD of B. subtilis 168 and the fact that the promoter of the iturin A operon which we identified was also conserved in an upstream sequence of xynD imply that horizontal transfer of this operon occurred. When the promoter was replaced by the repU promoter of the plasmid pUB110 replication protein, production of iturin A increased threefold.	1
Title: Structural analysis of Notch-regulating Rumi reveals basis for pathogenic mutations Abstract: Rumi O-glucosylates the EGF repeats of a growing list of proteins essential in metazoan development, including Notch. Rumi is essential for Notch signaling, and Rumi dysregulation is linked to several human diseases. Despite Rumi's critical roles, it is unknown how Rumi glucosylates a serine of many but not all EGF repeats. Here we report crystal structures of Drosophila Rumi as binary and ternary complexes with a folded EGF repeat and/or donor substrates. These structures provide insights into the catalytic mechanism and show that Rumi recognizes structural signatures of the EGF motif, the U-shaped consensus sequence, C-X-S-X-(P/A)-C and a conserved hydrophobic region. We found that five Rumi mutations identified in cancers and Dowling-Degos disease are clustered around the enzyme active site and adversely affect its activity. Our study suggests that loss of Rumi activity may underlie these diseases, and the mechanistic insights may facilitate the development of modulators of Notch signaling.	0
Title: Crystallization and preliminary X-ray analysis of the O-methyltransferase NovP from the novobiocin-biosynthetic cluster of Streptomyces spheroides Abstract: Crystals of recombinant NovP (subunit MW = 29 967 Da; 262 amino acids), an S-adenosyl-L-methionine-dependent O-methyltransferase from Streptomyces spheroides, were grown by vapour diffusion. The protein crystallized in space group P2, with unit-cell parameters a = 51.81, b = 46.04, c = 61.22 A, beta = 104.97 degrees. Native data to a maximum resolution of 1.4 A were collected from a single crystal at the synchrotron. NovP is involved in the biosynthesis of the aminocoumarin antibiotic novobiocin that targets the essential bacterial enzyme DNA gyrase.	1
Title: Biosynthesis of hygrocins, antitumor naphthoquinone ansamycins produced by Streptomyces sp. LZ35 Abstract: Hygrocins are naphthoquinone ansamycins with significant antitumor activities. Here, we report the identification and characterization of the hygrocin biosynthetic gene cluster (hgc) in Streptomyces sp. LZ35. A biosynthetic pathway is proposed based on bioinformatics analysis of the hgc genes and intermediates accumulated in selected gene disruption mutants. One of the steps during the biosynthesis of hygrocins is a Baeyer–Villiger oxidation between C5 and C6, catalyzed by luciferase- like monooxygenase homologue Hgc3. Hgc3 represents the founding member of a previously uncharacterized family of enzymes acting as Baeyer–Villiger monooxygenases.	1
Title: Nonprescription Antimicrobial Use in a Primary Care Population in the United States Abstract: Community antimicrobial resistance rates are high in communities with frequent use of nonprescription antibiotics. Studies addressing nonprescription antibiotic use in the United States have been restricted to Latin American immigrants. We estimated the prevalence of nonprescription antibiotic use in the previous 12 months as well as intended use (intention to use antibiotics without a prescription) and storage of antibiotics and examined patient characteristics associated with nonprescription use in a random sample of adults. We selected private and public primary care clinics that serve ethnically and socioeconomically diverse patients. Within the clinics, we used race/ethnicity-stratified systematic random sampling to choose a random sample of primary care patients. We used a self-administered standardized questionnaire on antibiotic use. Multivariate regression analysis was used to identify independent predictors of nonprescription use. The response rate was 94%. Of 400 respondents, 20 (5%) reported nonprescription use of systemic antibiotics in the last 12 months, 102 (25.4%) reported intended use, and 57 (14.2%) stored antibiotics at home. These rates were similar across race/ethnicity groups. Sources of antibiotics used without prescriptions or stored for future use were stores or pharmacies in the United States, "leftover" antibiotics from previous prescriptions, antibiotics obtained abroad, or antibiotics obtained from a relative or friend. Respiratory symptoms were common reasons for the use of nonprescription antibiotics. In multivariate analyses, public clinic patients, those with less education, and younger patients were more likely to endorse intended use. The problem of nonprescription use is not confined to Latino communities. Community antimicrobial stewardship must include a focus on nonprescription antibiotics.	0
Title: A fumonisin biosynthetic gene cluster in Fusarium oxysporum strain O-1890 and the genetic basis for B versus C fumonisin production Abstract: Most species of Fusarium that produce fumonisin mycotoxins produce predominantly B fumonisins (FBs). However, Fusarium oxysporum strain O-1890 produces predominantly C fumonisins (FCs). In this study, the nucleotide sequence of the fumonisin biosynthetic gene (FUM) cluster in strain O-1890 was determined. The order and orientation of FUM genes were the same as in the previously described clusters in Fusarium verticillioides and Fusarium proliferatum. Coding regions of F. oxysporum and F. verticillioides FUM genes were 88-92% identical, but regions flanking the clusters did not share significant identity. The FUM cluster gene FUM8 encodes an alpha-oxoamine synthase, and fum8 mutants of F. verticillioides do not produce fumonisins. Complementation of a fum8 mutant with the F. verticillioidesFUM8 restored FB production. Complementation with F. oxysporumFUM8 also restored production, but the fumonisins produced were predominantly FCs. These data indicate that different orthologues of FUM8 determine whether Fusarium produces predominantly FBs or FCs.	1
Title: Ureaplasma antigenic variation beyond MBA phase variation: DNA inversions generating chimeric structures and switching in expression of the MBA N-terminal paralogue UU172 Abstract: Phase variation of the major ureaplasma surface membrane protein, the multiple-banded antigen (MBA), with its counterpart, the UU376 protein, was recently discussed as a result of DNA inversion occurring at specific inverted repeats. Two similar inverted repeats to the ones within the mba locus were found in the genome of Ureaplasma parvum serovar 3; one within the MBA N-terminal paralogue UU172 and another in the adjacent intergenic spacer region. In this report, we demonstrate on both genomic and protein level that DNA inversion at these inverted repeats leads to alternating expression between UU172 and the neighbouring conserved hypothetical ORF UU171. Sequence analysis of this phase-variable 'UU172 element' from both U. parvum and U. urealyticum strains revealed that it is highly conserved among both species and that it also includes the orthologue of UU144. A third inverted repeat region in UU144 is proposed to serve as an additional potential inversion site from which chimeric genes can evolve. Our results indicate that site-specific recombination events in the genome of U. parvum serovar 3 are dynamic and frequent, leading to a broad spectrum of antigenic variation by which the organism may evade host immune responses.	0
Title: Each peptide of the two-component lantibiotic lacticin 3147 requires a separate modification enzyme for activity Abstract: The genetic determinants for production and immunity to the two-component lantibiotic lacticin 3147 are encoded by a 12.6 kb region of the plasmid pMRC01. This region contains ten genes arranged in two divergent clusters; these include the structural genes and a number of genes whose products show significant similarity to proteins involved in the biosynthesis of other lantibiotics. Using a strategy of deletion and mutational analysis, the effect of disruption of a number of these genes was investigated. Inactivation of either of the structural genes, ltnA1 or ltnA2, resulted in mutants that were incapable of producing active lacticin 3147; however, the combination of the cell-free supernatant from both mutants resulted in a restoration of bacteriocin activity, confirming that processing and export of the structural peptides can occur independently. An unusual feature of the lacticin 3147 gene cluster is the presence of two lanM homologues, whose gene products are proposed to be involved in the dehydration and thioether-forming reactions which result in lanthionine bridge formation. Mutants created in the ltnM1 and ltnM2 genes were also incapable of lantibiotic production, confirming an essential role for these enzymes in the lacticin 3147 biosynthetic pathway and supporting the assertion that these proteins are modification enzymes. Interestingly, addition of purified LtnA1, but not purified LtnA2, to the cell-free supernatant of the ltnM1 mutant restored bacteriocin activity; in contrast, only purified LtnA2 could complement the cell-free supernatant of the ltnM2 mutant. Creation of a number of double mutants supported these findings, and confirmed that LtnM1 is required to produce mature LtnA1, while LtnM2 is required to produce mature LtnA2.	1
Title: High-throughput bead-based identification of structure-switching aptamer beacons Abstract: We describe a new platform to identify structure-switching DNA beacon aptamers, which detect small molecules in a specific manner. By clonally amplifying a DNA library designed to fluoresce in response to binding events onto microbeads, aptamer beacons can be selected by stringent fluorescence-assisted sorting. We validated this method by isolating known and novel anti-steroid aptamers from two separate DNA libraries that were structurally enriched with three-way junctions. Importantly, aptamers were retrieved in only a few (three) rounds of selection by this approach and did not require further optimization, significantly streamlining the process of beacon development.	0
Title: An unusually large multifunctional polypeptide in the erythromycin-producing polyketide synthase of Saccharopolyspora erythraea Abstract: Erythromycin A, a clinically important polyketide antibiotic, is produced by the Gram-positive bacterium Saccharopolyspora erythraea. In an arrangement that seems to be generally true of antibiotic biosynthetic genes in Streptomyces and related bacteria like S. erythraea, the ery genes encoding the biosynthetic pathway to erythromycin are clustered around the gene (ermE) that confers self-resistance on S. erythraea. The aglycone core of erythromycin A is derived from one propionyl-CoA and six methylmalonyl-CoA units, which are incorporated head-to-tail into the growing polyketide chain, in a process similar to that of fatty-acid biosynthesis, to generate a macrolide intermediate, 6-deoxyerythronolide B. 6-Deoxyerythronolide B is converted into erythromycin A through the action of specific hydroxylases, glycosyltransferases and a methyltransferase. We report here the analysis of about 10 kilobases of DNA from S. erythraea, cloned by chromosome 'walking' outwards from the erythromycin-resistance determinant ermE, and previously shown to be essential for erythromycin biosynthesis. Partial sequencing of this region indicates that it encodes the synthase. Our results confirm this, and reveal a novel organization of the erythromycin-producing polyketide synthase, which provides further insight into the mechanism of chain assembly.	1
Title: Co-Occurrence of Listeria spp. and Spoilage Associated Microbiota During Meat Processing Due to Cross-Contamination Events Abstract: A large part of foodborne outbreaks related to Listeria monocytogenes are linked to meat and meat products. Especially, recontamination of meat products and deli-meat during slicing, packaging, and repackaging is in the focus of food authorities. In that regard, L. monocytogenes persistence in multi-species biofilms is one major issue, since they survive elaborate cleaning and disinfection measures. Here, we analyzed the microbial community structure throughout a meat processing facility using a combination of high-throughput full-length 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene sequencing and traditional microbiological methods. Samples were taken at different stages during meat cutting as well as from multiple sites throughout the facility environment to capture the product and the environmental associated microbiota co-occurring with Listeria spp. and L. monocytogenes. The listeria testing revealed a widely disseminated contamination (50%; 88 of 176 samples were positive for Listeria spp. and 13.6%; 24 of 176 samples were positive for L. monocytogenes). The pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) typing evidenced 14 heterogeneous L. monocytogenes profiles with PCR-serogroup 1/2a, 3a as most dominant. PFGE type MA3-17 contributed to the resilient microbiota of the facility environment and was related to environmental persistence. The core in-house microbiota consisted mainly of the genera Acinetobacter, Pseudomonas, Psychrobacter (Proteobacteria), Anaerobacillus, Bacillus (Firmicutes), and Chryseobacterium (Bacteroidota). While the overall microbial community structure clearly differed between product and environmental samples, we were able to discern correlation patterns regarding the presence/absence of Listeria spp. in both sample groups. Specifically, our longitudinal analysis revealed association of Listeria spp. with known biofilm-producing Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter, and Janthinobacterium species on the meat samples. Similar patterns were also observed on the surface, indicating dispersal of microorganisms from this multispecies biofilm. Our data provided a better understanding of the built environment microbiome in the meat processing context and promoted more effective options for targeted disinfection in the analyzed facility.	0
Title: The LuxR family members GdmRI and GdmRII are positive regulators of geldanamycin biosynthesis in Streptomyces hygroscopicus 17997 Abstract: The recent sequencing of the DNA region of the geldanamycin post-polyketide synthase (PKS) modification gene clusters revealed the presence of two regulatory genes: gdmRI (2,907 bp) and gdmRII (2,766 bp). The deduced products of gdmRI and gdmRII (968 and 921 amino acid residues, respectively) were identified as homologues of the LuxR transcriptional regulatory proteins. Inactivation by gene replacement of gdmRI or gdmRII in the Streptomyces hygroscopicus 17997 genome resulted in a complete loss of geldanamycin production. Complementation by a plasmid carrying gdmRI or gdmRII restored geldanamycin production, suggesting that the products of these two regulatory genes are positive regulators that are required for geldanamycin biosynthesis. The gdmRI transcript was detected in the DeltagdmRII mutant, and the gdmRII was detected in the DeltagdmRI mutant, indicating that the two genes are transcribed independently and do not regulate each other. Time course of gene expression analysis by RT-PCR of the geldanamycin biosynthetic genes showed that the transcription of gdmRI and gdmRII correlates with that of genes involved in polyketide biosynthesis, but not with the post-PKS modification gene gdmN, whose transcription is initiated earlier. gdmRI or gdmRII gene disruptants did not transcribe the polyketide biosynthetic related genes pks, gdmF, and gdnA-O-P, but did trancribe gdmN. These results demonstrated that gdmRI and gdmRII are pathway-specific positive regulators that control the polyketide biosynthetic genes in geldanamycin biosynthesis, but not the post-PKS modification gene, gdmN.	1
Title: A suite of asymmetric citrate siderophores isolated from a marine Shewanella species Abstract: Woodybactins A-D are a suite of new fatty acyl siderophores produced by the luminous marine bacterium Shewanella woodyi MS32. While this bacterium has a set of genes homologous to the biosynthetic gene cluster for aerobactin, aerobactin is not produced. The arrangement of these genes within the genome differs in S. woodyi MS32 when compared to E. coli and other species producing siderophores similar to aerobactin, and one synthetase gene which would append a second acyl-hydroxylysine to the terminal carboxylate of citrate is not functional. Within the suite of woodybactins A-D, which differ by the fatty acid appendage, one contains an unusual C9 (9:0) fatty acid and one contains a unique branched C9 iso (9:0 iso) fatty acid, as well as a C8 (8:0) and C10 (10:0) fatty acid.	1
Title: Studies of aluminum reinsertion into borosilicate zeolites with intersecting channels of 10- and 12-ring channel systems Abstract: The work here describes the kinetic analyses of aluminum replacement for boron in a suite of borosilicate molecular sieves. While the method has been described before as a means of converting synthesized borosilicates (with weak inherent acidity) to aluminosilicates (with much stronger acid strength) when there are large pores in the structure, here we carry out the transformation under less than optimal replacement concentrations, in order to better follow the kinetics. We examined several zeolite structures with boundary conditions of boron MEL where there are only 10-ring (or intermediate) pore structures and no Al is taken up, to multidimensional large pore zeolites, like boron beta, where Al substitution can occur everywhere. We also studied materials with both intermediate and large pores, SSZ-56, 57, 70, and 82. In the case of 57 up to 90% of the structure is made up of boron MEL. We observe that the pH drop is proportional to the Al reinsertion and is the same for all zeolites we studied. In one case, we compared a zeolite (SSZ-24) with boron and then no boron sites and found that Al does not go into defect sites. It was again confirmed (shown in earlier work) that Al will go into nest sites created by boron hydrolysis out of the substrate before Al treatment. Along those lines we also made two new observations: (1) the profile for Al uptake, as followed by pH drop, is the same kinetically, whether the boron is there or not; and (2) NMR showed that the boron is leaving the structure faster than Al can go back in (SSZ-33 study), even when we treat a material with boron in the lattice.	0
Title: Pseudomonas fluorescens CHA0 produces enantio-pyochelin, the optical antipode of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa siderophore pyochelin Abstract: The siderophore pyochelin is made by a thiotemplate mechanism from salicylate and two molecules of cysteine. In Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the first cysteine residue is converted to its D-isoform during thiazoline ring formation whereas the second cysteine remains in its L-configuration, thus determining the stereochemistry of the two interconvertible pyochelin diastereoisomers as 4'R, 2''R, 4''R (pyochelin I) and 4'R, 2''S, 4''R (pyochelin II). Pseudomonas fluorescens CHA0 was found to make a different stereoisomeric mixture, which promoted growth under iron limitation in strain CHA0 and induced the expression of its biosynthetic genes, but was not recognized as a siderophore and signaling molecule by P. aeruginosa. Reciprocally, pyochelin promoted growth and induced pyochelin gene expression in P. aeruginosa, but was not functional in P. fluorescens. The structure of the CHA0 siderophore was determined by mass spectrometry, thin-layer chromatography, NMR, polarimetry, and chiral HPLC as enantio-pyochelin, the optical antipode of the P. aeruginosa siderophore pyochelin. Enantio-pyochelin was chemically synthesized and confirmed to be active in CHA0. Its potential biosynthetic pathway in CHA0 is discussed.	1
Title: A spectinomycin resistance determinant from the spectinomycin producer Streptomyces flavopersicus Abstract: The spectinomycin (sp) resistance determinant from Streptomyces flavopersicus was cloned into Streptomyces lividans using the plasmid vector pIJ699. A plasmid, pDGL15, with a 3.65 kb insert from S. flavopersicus conferring resistance to Sp was isolated. DNA sequence analysis of the 3651 1 bp DNA insert revealed four open reading frames (ORFs). The amino acid sequence deduced from one ORF (SpcN) showed a high degree of similarity to an aminoglycoside phosphotransferase (StrN) and from a second one (SpcR) to a regulatory protein (StrR) of the streptomycin biosynthesis gene cluster from S. griseus. The two other ORFs were incomplete and the deduced amino acid sequences showed similarities to an amidinotransferase encoded in the streptomycin biosynthesis gene cluster of S. griseus and to the transposase of IS112, respectively. Expression of the spcN gene in E. coli under the control of tac promoter conferred Sp resistance to the cells. An enzymic assay confirmed that the gene product of spcN is an ATP-dependent aminoglycoside phosphotransferase which phosphorylates Sp and actinamine, the aminocyclitol moiety of Sp.	1
Title: Molecular characterization of co-transcribed genes from Streptomyces tendae Tü901 involved in the biosynthesis of the peptidyl moiety and assembly of the peptidyl nucleoside antibiotic nikkomycin Abstract: Six genes (nikP1, nikP2, nikS, nikT, nikU, and nikV) from Streptomyces tendae Tu901 were identified by analysis of the nucleotide sequence of the nikkomycin gene cluster. These genes, together with the previously described nikQ and nikR, span 9.39 kb and are transcribed as a polycistronic mRNA in a growth-phase-dependent manner. The nikP1 gene encodes a non-ribosomal peptide synthase consisting of an adenylation domain, a thiolation domain, and an N-terminal 70-residue segment of unknown function. The amino acid sequence encoded by the nikP2 gene displays similarity to the sequences of thioesterases, and the nikS product belongs to a superfamily of proteins characterized by a specific ATP-binding fold. The N-terminal 70 amino acids of the predicted nikT gene product show significant sequence similarity to acyl carrier proteins, and the C-terminal 330 amino acids to aminotransferases. The sequences of the deduced proteins NikU and NikV exhibit similarity to components S and E, respectively, of glutamate mutase from Clostridium. Disruption of the nikP1, nikS, nikT, or nikV gene by insertion of a kanamycin resistance cassette abolished formation of nikkomycins I, J, X, and Z, all of which contain hydroxypyridylhomothreonine as the peptidyl moiety. The nikP1 mutants, and the nikS and nikT mutants accumulated the nucleoside moieties nikkomycin Cz, and nikkomycins Cx and Cz, respectively. The nikV mutants formed nikkomycins Ox and Oz, which contain 2-amino-4-hydroxy-4-(3'-hydroxy-6'-pyridyl) butanoic acid as the peptidyl moiety. The nikP2 mutants synthesized nikkomycins I, J, X, and Z, but amounts of nikkomycins I and X, which contain formylimidazolone as the base, were lower. Feeding formylimidazolone to nikP2 mutants restored the ability to form nikkomycins I and X. Our results indicate that nikU and nikV are required for the synthesis of hydroxypyridylhomothreonine, the genes nikP1, nikP2 and nikS are required for the assembly of nikkomycins, and nikT is required for both pathways. The putative activities of each of their products are discussed.	1
Title: Conservation of the genes for HC-toxin biosynthesis in Alternaria jesenskae Abstract: Background:                       HC-toxin, a cyclic tetrapeptide, is a virulence determinant for the plant pathogenic fungus Cochliobolus carbonum. It was recently discovered that another fungus, Alternaria jesenskae, also produces HC-toxin.                  Results:                       The major genes (collectively known as AjTOX2) involved in the biosynthesis of HC-toxin were identified from A. jesenskae by genomic sequencing. The encoded orthologous proteins share 75-85% amino acid identity, and the genes for HC-toxin biosynthesis are duplicated in both fungi. The genomic organization of the genes in the two fungi show a similar but not identical partial clustering arrangement. A set of representative housekeeping proteins show a similar high level of amino acid identity between C. carbonum and A. jesenskae, which is consistent with the close relatedness of these two genera within the family Pleosporaceae (Dothideomycetes).                  Conclusions:                       This is the first report that the plant virulence factor HC-toxin is made by an organism other than C. carbonum. The genes may have moved by horizontal transfer between the two species, but it cannot be excluded that they were present in a common ancestor and lost from other species of Alternaria and Cochliobolus.	1
Title: Involvement of enterobactin synthesis pathway in production of microcin H47 Abstract: Microcin H47 (MccH47) is a gene-encoded peptide antibiotic produced by an Escherichia coli clinical isolate which is active on strains of gram-negative bacteria. Its uptake by E. coli K-12-susceptible cells depends on the presence of any of the outer membrane proteins Cir, Fiu, and FepA, the three catechol receptors of this organism. The nucleotide sequence of a portion of the MccH47 genetic system that had not yet been studied was elucidated. Five open reading frames were identified, three of which corresponded to genes encoding functions related to catechol-type siderophores: mchA and mchS1 are iroB and iroD homologues, respectively, and mchS4 was found to promote the production of the catecholate siderophore enterobactin. The possible relationship between enterobactin synthesis and MccH47 production was studied. Enterobactin-deficient strains failed to produce MccH47 when transformed with the antibiotic genetic determinants and upon introduction of the ent genetic cluster, the production of both the siderophore and MccH47 was restored. Further studies demonstrated that at least the enterobactin nonribosomal peptide synthase EntF is necessary for MccH47 synthesis. The relationship found between MccH47 and catecholate siderophore production is discussed, and a model outlining MccH47 synthesis is proposed.	1
Title: Prostaglandin E2 biosynthesis by rabbit renomedullary interstitial cells in tissue culture. Mechanism of stimulation by angiotensin II, bradykinin, and arginine vasopressin Abstract: The mechanism of hormone-stimulated prostaglandin E2 biosynthesis was investigated in rabbit renomedullary interstitial cells in tissue culture. Angiotensin II, bradykinin, and arginine vasopressin stimulated arachidonic acid release and subsequent prostaglandin biosynthesis. Indomethacin completely inhibited prostaglandin biosynthesis without affecting arachidonic acid release. Mepacrine, a phospholipase inhibitor, inhibited arachidonic acid release without affecting subsequent synthesis of prostaglandin E2. Our studies suggest that arachidonic acid release via hormone-activated phospholipase or acylhydrolase (or both) is the mechanism of hormone-stimulated prostaglandin E2 biosynthesis.	0
Title: Natural Product Discovery through Improved Functional Metagenomics in Streptomyces Abstract: Because the majority of environmental bacteria are not easily culturable, access to many bacterially encoded secondary metabolites will be dependent on the development of improved functional metagenomic screening methods. In this study, we examined a collection of diverse Streptomyces species for the best innate ability to heterologously express biosynthetic gene clusters. We then optimized methods for constructing high quality metagenomic cosmid libraries in the best Streptomyces host. An initial screen of a 1.5 million-membered metagenomic library constructed in Streptomyces albus, the species that exhibited the highest propensity for heterologous expression of gene clusters, led to the identification of the novel natural product metatricycloene (1). Metatricycloene is a tricyclic polyene encoded by a reductive, iterative polyketide-like gene cluster. Related gene clusters found in sequenced genomes appear to encode a largely unexplored collection of structurally diverse, polyene-based metabolites.	1
Title: Biosynthesis of the putative siderophore erythrochelin requires unprecedented crosstalk between separate nonribosomal peptide gene clusters Abstract: The genome of the erythromycin-producing bacterium Saccharopolyspora erythraea contains many orphan secondary metabolite gene clusters including two (nrps3 and nrps5) predicted to govern biosynthesis of nonribosomal peptide-based siderophores. We report here the production by S. erythraea, even under iron-sufficient conditions, of a 2,5-diketopiperazine siderophore candidate we have named erythrochelin. Deletion of the nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) gene ercD within the nrps5 cluster abolished erythrochelin production. The tetrapeptide backbone of erythrochelin (alpha-N-acetyl-delta-N-acetyl-delta-N-hydroxyornithine-serine-delta-N-hydroxyornithine-delta-N-acetyl-delta-N-hydroxyornithine) suggests an orthodox colinear model for erythrochelin assembly. Curiously, the delta-N-acetyltransferase required for erythrochelin biosynthesis is encoded within a remote NRPS-cluster (nrps1) whose own NRPS contains an inactivating mutation. Disruption of the nrps1 gene mcd abolished erythrochelin biosynthesis, which could then be restored by addition of synthetic L-delta-N-acetyl-delta-N-hydroxyornithine, confirming an unprecedented example of functional crosstalk between nrps clusters.	1
Title: Molecular insights into the biosynthesis of guadinomine: a type III secretion system inhibitor Abstract: Guadinomines are a recently discovered family of anti-infective compounds produced by Streptomyces sp. K01-0509 with a novel mode of action. With an IC(50) of 14 nM, guadinomine B is the most potent known inhibitor of the type III secretion system (TTSS) of Gram-negative bacteria. TTSS activity is required for the virulence of many pathogenic Gram-negative bacteria including Escherichia coli , Salmonella spp., Yersinia spp., Chlamydia spp., Vibrio spp., and Pseudomonas spp. The guadinomine (gdn) biosynthetic gene cluster has been cloned and sequenced and includes 26 open reading frames spanning 51.2 kb. It encodes a chimeric multimodular polyketide synthase, a nonribosomal peptide synthetase, along with enzymes responsible for the biosynthesis of the unusual aminomalonyl-acyl carrier protein extender unit and the signature carbamoylated cyclic guanidine. Its identity was established by targeted disruption of the gene cluster as well as by heterologous expression and analysis of key enzymes in the biosynthetic pathway. Identifying the guadinomine gene cluster provides critical insight into the biosynthesis of these scarce but potentially important natural products.	1
Title: Cyclization of fungal nonribosomal peptides by a terminal condensation-like domain Abstract: Cyclization of linear peptidyl precursors produced by nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) is an important step in the biosynthesis of bioactive cyclic peptides. Whereas bacterial NRPSs use thioesterase domains to perform the cyclization, fungal NRPSs have apparently evolved to use a different enzymatic route. In verified fungal NRPSs that produce macrocyclic peptides, each megasynthetase terminates with a condensation-like (C(T)) domain that may perform the macrocyclization reaction. To probe the role of such a C(T) domain, we reconstituted the activities of the Penicillium aethiopicum trimodular NPRS TqaA in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and in vitro. Together with the reconstituted bimodular NRPS AnaPS, we dissected the cyclization steps of TqaA in transforming the linear anthranilate-D-tryptophan-L-alanyl tripeptide into fumiquinazoline F. Extensive biochemical and mutational studies confirmed the essential role of the C(T) domain in catalyzing cyclization in a thiolation domain-dependent fashion. Our work provides evidence of a likely universal macrocyclization strategy used by fungal NRPSs.	1
Title: Reconstitution of biosynthetic machinery for indole-diterpene paxilline in Aspergillus oryzae Abstract: Indole-diterpenes represented by paxilline share a common pentacyclic core skeleton derived from indole and geranylgeranyl diphosphate. To shed light on the detailed biosynthetic mechanism of the paspaline-type hexacyclic skeleton, we examined the reconstitution of paxilline biosynthetic machinery in Aspergillus oryzae NSAR1. Stepwise introduction of the six pax genes enabled us to isolate all biosynthetic intermediates and to synthesize paxilline. In vitro and in vivo studies on the key enzymes, prenyltransferase PaxC and cyclase PaxB, allowed us to elucidate actual substrates of these enzymes. Using the isolated and the synthesized epoxide substrates, the highly intriguing stepwide epoxidation/cyclization mechanism for the construction of core structure has been confirmed. In addition, we also demonstrated "tandem transformation" to simultaneously introduce two genes using a single vector (paxG/paxB, pAdeA; paxP/paxQ, pUNA). This may provide further option for the reconstitution strategy to synthesize more complex fungal metabolites.	1
Title: Gβγ directly modulates vesicle fusion by competing with synaptotagmin for binding to neuronal SNARE proteins embedded in membranes Abstract: Gi/o-coupled G protein-coupled receptors can inhibit neurotransmitter release at synapses via multiple mechanisms. In addition to Gβγ-mediated modulation of voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCC), inhibition can also be mediated through the direct interaction of Gβγ subunits with the soluble N-ethylmaleimide attachment protein receptor (SNARE) complex of the vesicle fusion apparatus. Binding studies with soluble SNARE complexes have shown that Gβγ binds to both ternary SNARE complexes, t-SNARE heterodimers, and monomeric SNAREs, competing with synaptotagmin 1(syt1) for binding sites on t-SNARE. However, in secretory cells, Gβγ, SNAREs, and synaptotagmin interact in the lipid environment of a vesicle at the plasma membrane. To approximate this environment, we show that fluorescently labeled Gβγ interacts specifically with lipid-embedded t-SNAREs consisting of full-length syntaxin 1 and SNAP-25B at the membrane, as measured by fluorescence polarization. Fluorescently labeled syt1 undergoes competition with Gβγ for SNARE-binding sites in lipid environments. Mutant Gβγ subunits that were previously shown to be more efficacious at inhibiting Ca2+-triggered exocytotic release than wild-type Gβγ were also shown to bind SNAREs at a higher affinity than wild type in a lipid environment. These mutant Gβγ subunits were unable to inhibit VGCC currents. Specific peptides corresponding to regions on Gβ and Gγ shown to be important for the interaction disrupt the interaction in a concentration-dependent manner. In in vitro fusion assays using full-length t- and v-SNAREs embedded in liposomes, Gβγ inhibited Ca2+/synaptotagmin-dependent fusion. Together, these studies demonstrate the importance of these regions for the Gβγ-SNARE interaction and show that the target of Gβγ, downstream of VGCC, is the membrane-embedded SNARE complex.	0
Title: Anthracycline metabolites from baumycin-producing Streptomyces sp. D788. I. Isolation of antibiotic-blocked mutants and their characterization Abstract: Biosynthetically blocked mutants were obtained from a baumycin-producing Streptomyces sp. D788 newly isolated from soil. The first mutant isolated was a baumycin-negative but daunorubicin-accumulating mutant with a loss of 4'-substitution activity, from which all other blocked mutants were successively derived. These included a known 11-deoxydaunorubicin-producing mutant and several new types of mutants which produced mainly 10-carboxy-13-deoxocarminomycin, 10-methoxycarbonyl-13-deoxocarminomycin, their 11-deoxy derivatives or a precursor aglycone, respectively. In this paper, all the anthracycline components produced by the parent strain and its two known blocked mutants, a daunorubicin producer and a 11-deoxydaunorubicin producer, are also determined by HPLC and five new components are isolated. Cytotoxicities in vitro of all the components against L1210 cell culture are also described.	0
Title: Analogues of the Potent Antitumor Compound Leiodermatolide from a Deep-Water Sponge of the Genus Leiodermatium Abstract: Two new analogues of the potent antitumor compound leiodermatolide, which we call leiodermatolides B and C, have been isolated from specimens of a deep-water sponge of the genus Leiodermatium collected off Florida. The compounds were purified using standard chromatographic methods, and the structures defined through interpretation of the HRMS and 1D and 2D NMR data. Leiodermatolide B (2) lacks the C-21 hydroxy group found in leiodermatolide and has equal potency as the parent compound, providing a simpler analogue for possible clinical development. It inhibits the proliferation of the AsPC-1 human pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell line with an IC50 of 43 nM. Leiodermatolide C (3) has a modified macrolide ring and is over 85-fold less potent with an IC50 of 3.7 μM against the same cell line. These compounds add to the knowledge of the pharmacophore of this class of potent antitumor agents.	0
Title: The antiparasitic compound licochalcone a is a potent echinocytogenic agent that modifies the erythrocyte membrane in the concentration range where antiplasmodial activity is observed Abstract: The well-known antiparasitic compound licochalcone A is a potent membrane-active agent that transforms normal erythrocytes into echinocytes in parallel with the inhibition of growth of Plasmodium falciparum cultures, the in vitro antiplasmodial effect apparently being an indirect effect on the host cell. In vitro experiments with synchronous cultures demonstrate that inhibition of invasion is the principal mechanism of growth inhibition. The erythrocyte membrane-modifying effect was also transiently observed in vivo in mice after intravenous administration.	0
Title: Selecting the highest of three binomial probabilities Abstract: A sequential elimination procedure for selecting the highest probability in binomial trials, proposed by Levin and Robbins [Levin, B. & Robbins, H. (1981) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 78, 4663-4666], is examined further in the special case of trials involving three probabilities. A conjectured inequality relating ratios of selection probabilities to odds ratios is shown to hold only under certain necessary and sufficient conditions. Weaker conjectured inequalities involving the probability of correct selection are shown to hold without restriction.	0
Title: Identification of the nusB gene product of Escherichia coli Abstract: Escherichia coli nusB mutants fail to support the activity of a phage lambda gene product, pN, which regulates phage gene expression by influencing transcription termination. We report the identification of the nusB protein on SDS-polyacrylamide gels as a 14,500 dalton protein.	0
Title: Complete genome sequence of the erythromycin-producing bacterium Saccharopolyspora erythraea NRRL23338 Abstract: Saccharopolyspora erythraea is used for the industrial-scale production of the antibiotic erythromycin A, derivatives of which play a vital role in medicine. The sequenced chromosome of this soil bacterium comprises 8,212,805 base pairs, predicted to encode 7,264 genes. It is circular, like those of the pathogenic actinomycetes Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Corynebacterium diphtheriae, but unlike the linear chromosomes of the model actinomycete Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) and the closely related Streptomyces avermitilis. The S. erythraea genome contains at least 25 gene clusters for production of known or predicted secondary metabolites, at least 72 genes predicted to confer resistance to a range of common antibiotic classes and many sets of duplicated genes to support its saprophytic lifestyle. The availability of the genome sequence of S. erythraea will improve insight into its biology and facilitate rational development of strains to generate high-titer producers of clinically important antibiotics.	1
Title: The siRNAsome: A Cation-Free and Versatile Nanostructure for siRNA and Drug Co-delivery Abstract: Nanoparticles show great potential for drug delivery. However, suitable nanostructures capable of loading a range of drugs together with the co-delivery of siRNAs, which avoid the problem of cation-associated cytotoxicity, are lacking. Herein, we report an small interfering RNA (siRNA)-based vesicle (siRNAsome), which consists of a hydrophilic siRNA shell, a thermal- and intracellular-reduction-sensitive hydrophobic median layer, and an empty aqueous interior that meets this need. The siRNAsome can serve as a versatile nanostructure to load drug agents with divergent chemical properties, therapeutic proteins as well as co-delivering immobilized siRNAs without transfection agents. Importantly, the inherent thermal/reduction-responsiveness enables controlled drug loading and release. When siRNAsomes are loaded with the hydrophilic drug doxorubicin hydrochloride and anti-P-glycoprotein siRNA, synergistic therapeutic activity is achieved in multidrug resistant cancer cells and a tumor model.	0
Title: Investigations of two bidirectional carbon monoxide dehydrogenases from Carboxydothermus hydrogenoformans by protein film electrochemistry Abstract: Carbon monoxide dehydrogenases (CODHs) catalyse the reversible conversion between CO and CO2 . Several small molecules or ions are inhibitors and probes for different oxidation states of the unusual [Ni-4 Fe-4 S] cluster that forms the active site. The actions of these small probes on two enzymes-CODH ICh and CODH IICh -produced by Carboxydothermus hydrogenoformans have been studied by protein film voltammetry to compare their behaviour and to establish general characteristics. Whereas CODH ICh is, so far, the better studied of the two isozymes in terms of its electrocatalytic properties, it is CODH IICh that has been characterised by X-ray crystallography. The two isozymes, which share 58.3% sequence identity and 73.9% sequence similarity, show similar patterns of behaviour with regard to selective inhibition of CO2 reduction by CO (product) and cyanate, potent and selective inhibition of CO oxidation by cyanide, and the action of sulfide, which promotes oxidative inactivation of the enzyme. For both isozymes, rates of binding of substrate analogues CN(-) (for CO) and NCO(-) (for CO2 ) are orders of magnitude lower than turnover, a feature that is clearly revealed through hysteresis of cyclic voltammetry. Inhibition by CN(-) and CO is much stronger for CODH IICh than for CODH ICh, a property that has relevance for applying these enzymes as model catalysts in solar-driven CO2 reduction.	0
Title: Dalmanol biosyntheses require coupling of two separate polyketide gene clusters Abstract: Polyketide-polyketide hybrids are unique natural products with promising bioactivity, but the hybridization processes remain poorly understood. Herein, we present that the biosynthetic pathways of two immunosuppressants, dalmanol A and acetodalmanol A, result from an unspecific monooxygenase triggered hybridization of two distinct polyketide (naphthalene and chromane) biosynthetic gene clusters. The orchestration of the functional dimorphism of the polyketide synthase (ChrA) ketoreductase (KR) domain (shortened as ChrA KR) with that of the KR partner (ChrB) in the bioassembly line increases the polyketide diversity and allows the fungal generation of plant chromanes (e.g., noreugenin) and phloroglucinols (e.g., 2,4,6-trihydroxyacetophenone). The simultaneous fungal biosynthesis of 1,3,6,8- and 2-acetyl-1,3,6,8-tetrahydroxynaphthalenes was addressed as well. Collectively, the work may symbolize a movement in understanding the multiple-gene-cluster involved natural product biosynthesis, and highlights the possible fungal generations of some chromane- and phloroglucinol-based phytochemicals.	1
Title: Structure of the low-affinity penicillin-binding protein 5 PBP5fm in wild-type and highly penicillin-resistant strains of Enterococcus faecium Abstract: Among its penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs), Enterococcus faecium possesses a low-affinity PBP5, PBP5fm, which is the main target involved in beta-lactam resistance. A 7.7-kb EcoRI chromosomal fragment of E. faecium D63r containing the pbp5fm gene was cloned and sequenced. Two open reading frames (ORFs) were found. A 2,037-bp ORF encoded the deduced 73.8-kDa PBP5fm, the amino acid sequences of which were, respectively, 99.8, 78.5, and 62% homologous to those of the low-affinity plasmid-encoded PBP3r of Enterococcus hirae S185r and the chromosome-encoded PBP5 of E. hirae R40 and Enterococcus faecalis 56R. A second 597-bp ORF, designated psrfm, was found 2.3 kb upstream of pbp5fm. It appeared to be 285 bp shorter than and 74% homologous with the regulatory gene psr of E. hirae ATCC 9790. Different clinical isolates of E. faecium, for which a wide range of benzylpenicillin MICs were observed, showed that the increases in MICs were related to two mechanisms. For some strains of intermediate resistance (MICs of 16 to 64 micrograms/ml), the increased level of resistance could be explained by the presence of larger quantities of PBP5fm which had an affinity for benzylpenicillin (second-order rate constant of protein acylation [k+2/K] values of 17 to 25 M(-1) s(-1)) that remained unchanged. For the two most highly resistant strains, EFM-1 (MIC, 90 micrograms/ml) and H80721 (MIC, 512 micrograms/ml), the resistance was related to different amino acid substitutions yielding very-low-affinity PBP5fm variants (k+2/K < or = 1.5 M(-1) s(-1)) which were synthesized in small quantities. More specifically, it appeared, with a three-dimensional model of the C-terminal domain of PBP5fm, that the substitutions of Met-485, located in the third position after the conserved SDN triad, by Thr in EFM-1 and by Ala in H80721 were the most likely cause of the decreasing affinity of PBP5fm observed in these strains.	0
Title: Purification and characterization of the antimicrobial peptide microcin N Abstract: Microcins are low-molecular-weight proteins secreted by certain bacteria that act by limiting the growth of other bacteria that share the same ecological niche. In the present work, the previous microcin 24 system was resequenced.We detected three nucleotide differences in the microcin-coding gene that partially change the amino acid sequence. According to the present microcin nomenclature, we renamed the five genes constituting this microcin system (mcnRINAB), which are arranged in an operon-like structure: mcnR codes for a putative histone-like nucleoid protein regulator; mcnI codes for the immunity protein; mcnN encodes microcin N; and mcnA and mcnB correspond to an ATP-binding cassette transporter system. Purified microcin N has a molecular weight of 7274.23 Da, as determined by MS. This peptide was stable up to 100°C, resistant to treatment with lipase, lysozyme, trypsin, and chymotrypsin, and susceptible to degradation by proteinase K.	1
Title: Exploiting the natural diversity of microviridin gene clusters for discovery of novel tricyclic depsipeptides Abstract: Microviridins are ribosomally synthesized tricyclic depsipeptides produced by different genera of cyanobacteria. The prevalence of the microviridin gene clusters and the natural diversity of microviridin precursor sequences are currently unknown. Screening of laboratory strains and field samples of the bloom-forming freshwater cyanobacterium Microcystis via PCR revealed global occurrence of the microviridin pathway and an unexpected natural variety. We could detect 15 new variants of the precursor gene mdnA encoding microviridin backbones that differ in up to 4 amino acid positions from known isoforms of the peptide. The survey not only provides insights into the versatility of the biosynthetic enzymes in a closely related group of cyanobacteria, but also facilitates the discovery and characterization of cryptic microviridin variants. This is demonstrated for microviridin L in Microcystis aeruginosa strain NIES843 and heterologously produced variants.	0
Title: Exploitation of sulfonylurea resistance marker and non-homologous end joining mutants for functional analysis in Zymoseptoria tritici Abstract: The lack of techniques for rapid assembly of gene deletion vectors, paucity of selectable marker genes available for genetic manipulation and low frequency of homologous recombination are major constraints in construction of gene deletion mutants in Zymoseptoria tritici. To address these issues, we have constructed ternary vectors for Agrobacterium tumefaciens mediated transformation of Z. tritici, which enable the single step assembly of multiple fragments via yeast recombinational cloning. The sulfonylurea resistance gene, which is a mutated allele of the Magnaporthe oryzae ILV2 gene, was established as a new dominant selectable marker for Z. tritici. To increase the frequency of homologous recombination, we have constructed Z. tritici strains deficient in the non-homologous end joining pathway of DNA double stranded break repair by inactivating the KU70 and KU80 genes. Targeted gene deletion frequency increased to more than 85% in both Z. tritici ku70 and ku80 null strains, compared to ⩽10% seen in the wild type parental strain IPO323. The in vitro growth and in planta pathogenicity of the Z. tritici ku70 and ku80 null strains were comparable to strain IPO323. Together these molecular tools add significantly to the platform available for genomic analysis through targeted gene deletion or promoter replacements and will facilitate large-scale functional characterization projects in Z. tritici.	0
Title: Characterization of the epoxide hydrolase NcsF2 from the neocarzinostatin biosynthetic gene cluster Abstract: Neocarzinostatin (1) biosynthesis is proposed to involve a vicinal diol intermediate. It is reported that NcsF2, one of two epoxide hydrolases encoded by the NCS gene cluster, catalyzes regiospecific addition of H(2)O to C-2 of both (R)- and (S)-styrene oxides to afford (R)- and (S)-1-phenyl-1,2-ethanediols, respectively, supporting its proposed role in 1 biosynthesis. (R)-1-Phenyl-1,2-ethanediol (87% yield and 99% ee) was obtained from (+/-)-styrene oxide hydrolysis by cocatalysis using NcsF2 and SgcF, the complementary epoxide hydrolase from the C-1027 biosynthetic pathway.	1
Title: Syntheses and biological activities of pyranyl-substituted cinnamates Abstract: Twenty-two kinds of pyranyl-substituted cinnamates were synthesized by the reaction of 4-hydroxy-6-(2-phenylethyl)-2H-pyran-2-one or 4-hydroxy-6-methyl-2H-pyran-2-one (HMP) with a variety of substituted cinnamic acids, and their antifungal and plant growth inhibitory activities were investigated. Among the compounds prepared, 6-methyl-2-oxo-2H-pyran-4-yl 3-(4-isopropylphenyl)propenoate (H5) showed the strongest antifungal activity against Rhizoctonia solani and Sclerotium dellfinii, and 6-methyl-2-oxo-2H-pyran-4-yl 3-(2-methylphenyl)propenoate (H2) had the highest plant growth inhibitory activity toward Brassica rapa.	0
Title: Identifying sigma factors in Mycobacterium smegmatis by comparative genomic analysis Abstract: Mycobacterium smegmatis is a saprophytic species that has been used for 15 years as a model to perform heterologous regulation and virulence studies of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Members of the extracytoplasmic sigma factors family, which are required for adaptive responses to various environmental stresses, are responsible for some of the virulence traits of M. tuberculosis. A bioinformatic search on the genome of M. smegmatis has predicted the existence of 26 sigma factors, which is twice the number that are present in M. tuberculosis. A phylogenetic analysis has shown that despite this high number of sigma factors the orthologs of the genes sigC, sigI and sigK of M. tuberculosis are absent in the M. smegmatis genome. Several sigma factors are specific for M. smegmatis, with a special enrichment in the sigH and, to a lesser extent, in the sigJ and sigL subfamily, pinpointing the potential variability of the repertoire of adaptive response in this saprophytic species.	1
Title: Characterization of the Francisella tularensis subsp. novicida type IV pilus Abstract: Francisella tularensis causes the disease tularaemia. Type IV pili (Tfp) genes are present in the genomes of all F. tularensis subspecies. We show that the wild-type F. tularensis subsp. novicida expresses pilus fibres on its surface, and mutations in the Tfp genes pilF and pilT disrupt pilus biogenesis. Mutations in other Tfp genes (pilQ and pilG) do not eliminate pilus expression. A mutation in pilE4 eliminates pilus expression, whereas mutations in the other pilin subunits pilE1-3 and pilE5 do not, suggesting that pilE4 is the major pilus structural subunit. The virulence regulator MglA is required for pilus expression, and it regulates the transcription of a putative Tfp glycosylation gene (FTN0431). However, MglA does not regulate transcription of pilF, pilT or pilE4, and a strain lacking FTN0431 still expresses pili; thus, it is unclear how MglA regulates pilus expression. Only pilF was also required for protein secretion, while pilE4 and pilT were not, indicating that there is very little overlap of the protein secretion/Tfp functions of the pil genes. The protein secretion component pilE1 was more important for in vitro intramacrophage growth and mouse virulence than the Tfp component pilE4. Our results provide the first genetic characterization of the novel Tfp system of F. tularensis.	0
Title: In vitro antibacterial activity and interactions with beta-lactamases and penicillin-binding proteins of the new monocarbam antibiotic U-78608 Abstract: U-78608, a new monocarbam antibiotic, was evaluated for in vitro activity against 312 clinical isolates of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria and subjected to several in vitro biochemical tests characterizing its interactions with beta-lactamases and penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs). The antibacterial activity of the compound was compared directly with those of SQ 83,360 (pirazmonam) and aztreonam. U-78608, SQ 83,360, and aztreonam had generally poor activity against gram-positive aerobic bacteria and anaerobic bacteria. U-78608 demonstrated activity primarily against gram-negative aerobic bacteria, with potency generally comparable to that of SQ 83,360. U-78608 and SQ 83,360 were less active than aztreonam for some gram-negative species; however, both compounds were 8- to 64-fold more active than aztreonam against Acinetobacter species, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Pseudomonas maltophilia. All three compounds resisted inactivation by several different beta-lactamases from gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Neither U-78608 nor SQ 83,360 exhibited significant inhibition of these enzymes, while aztreonam inhibited beta-lactamases from P. aeurginosa and Klebsiella oxytoca. All three compounds exhibited strong affinity to PBP 3 of Escherichia coli and moderate to negligible affinity to the other E. coli PBPs; quantitative measurements indicated that U-78608 had greater PBP 3 affinity than either SQ 83,360 or aztreonam.	0
Title: New gene cluster for lantibiotic streptin possibly involved in streptolysin S formation Abstract: Streptolysin S (SLS) is a serum-extractable and oxygen-stable hemolysin produced by Group A Streptococcus. A SLS-deficient mutant in which transposon Tn 916 was inserted in a locus distinct from the sag gene cluster [Nizet et al. (2000) Infect. Immun. 68, 4245-4254] was obtained by filter mating of the transposon-harbouring Enterococcus faecalis strain and Streptococcus pyogenes BL(T). This mutant, N22, had completely lost the hemolytic activity, in consequence of insertion of a single Tn 916 into a hitherto-unknown lantibiotic gene cluster composed of 10 open reading frames. The arrangement and sequence of this lantibiotic gene cluster were similar to those of nisin and subtilin, and so we designated this new lantibiotic as streptin. The bactericidal activity of streptin was abolished on treatment with trypsin or proteinase K. The different host range and nucleotide sequence clearly distinguished streptin from streptococcins. Streptin was not hemolytic and its bacteriocin activity was independent of carrier oligonucleotides effective for SLS. The fact that N22 also lost the anti-bacterial activity against indicator streptococci reveals that the factor(s) required for lantibiotic formation plays an important role in SLS formation as well.	1
Title: Gene cluster involved in the biosynthesis of griseobactin, a catechol-peptide siderophore of Streptomyces sp. ATCC 700974 Abstract: The main siderophores produced by streptomycetes are desferrioxamines. Here we show that Streptomyces sp. ATCC 700974 and several Streptomyces griseus strains, in addition, synthesize a hitherto unknown siderophore with a catechol-peptide structure, named griseobactin. The production is repressed by iron. We sequenced a 26-kb DNA region comprising a siderophore biosynthetic gene cluster encoding proteins similar to DhbABCEFG, which are involved in the biosynthesis of 2,3-dihydroxybenzoate (DHBA) and in the incorporation of DHBA into siderophores via a nonribosomal peptide synthetase. Adjacent to the biosynthesis genes are genes that encode proteins for the secretion, uptake, and degradation of siderophores. To correlate the gene cluster with griseobactin synthesis, the dhb genes in ATCC 700974 were disrupted. The resulting mutants no longer synthesized DHBA and griseobactin; production of both was restored by complementation with the dhb genes. Heterologous expression of the dhb genes or of the entire griseobactin biosynthesis gene cluster in the catechol-negative strain Streptomyces lividans TK23 resulted in the synthesis and secretion of DHBA or griseobactin, respectively, suggesting that these genes are sufficient for DHBA and griseobactin biosynthesis. Griseobactin was purified and characterized; its structure is consistent with a cyclic and, to a lesser extent, linear form of the trimeric ester of 2,3-dihydroxybenzoyl-arginyl-threonine complexed with aluminum under iron-limiting conditions. This is the first report identifying the gene cluster for the biosynthesis of DHBA and a catechol siderophore in Streptomyces.	1
Title: A molecular genetic map and electrophoretic karyotype of the plant pathogenic fungus Cochliobolus sativus Abstract: A molecular genetic map was constructed and an electrophoretic karyotype was resolved for Cochliobolus sativus, the causal agent of spot blotch of barley and wheat. The genetic map consists of 27 linkage groups with 97 amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers, 31 restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) markers, two polymerase chain reaction amplified markers, the mating type locus (CsMAT), and a gene (VHv1) conditioning high virulence on barley cv. Bowman. These linkage groups covered a map distance of 849 cM. The virulence gene VHv1 cosegregated with six AFLP markers and was mapped on one of the major linkage groups. Fifteen chromosome-sized DNAs were resolved in C. sativus isolates ND93-1 and ND9OPr with contour-clamped homogeneous electric field (CHEF) electrophoresis combined with telomere probe analysis of comigrating chromosome-sized DNAs. The chromosome sizes ranged from 1.25 to 3.80 Mbp, and the genome size of the fungus was estimated to be approximately 33 Mbp. By hybridizing genetically mapped RFLP and AFLP markers to CHEF blots, 25 of the 27 linkage groups were assigned to specific chromosomes. The barley-specific virulence locus VHv1 was localized on a chromosome of 2.80 Mbp from isolate ND9OPr in the CHEF gel. The total map length of the fungus was estimated to be at least 1,329 cM based on the map distance covered by the linked markers and the estimated gaps. Therefore, the physical to genetic distance ratio is approximately 25 kb/cM. Construction of a high-resolution map around target loci will facilitate the cloning of the genes conferring virulence and other characters in C. sativus by a map-based cloning strategy.	0
Title: Mutasynthesis of fluorinated pactamycin analogues and their antimalarial activity Abstract: A mutasynthetic strategy has been used to generate fluorinated TM-025 and TM-026, two biosynthetically engineered pactamycin analogues produced by Streptomyces pactum ATCC 27456. The fluorinated compounds maintain excellent activity and selectivity toward chloroquine-sensitive and multidrug-resistant strains of malarial parasites as the parent compounds. The results also provide insights into the biosynthesis of 3-aminobenzoic acid in S. pactum.	1
Title: Structure Elucidation and Activity of Kolossin A, the D-/L-Pentadecapeptide Product of a Giant Nonribosomal Peptide Synthetase Abstract: The largest continuous bacterial nonribosomal peptide synthetase discovered so far is described. It consists of 15 consecutive modules arising from an uninterrupted, fully functional gene in the entomopathogenic bacterium Photorhabdus luminescens. The identification of its cryptic biosynthesis product was achieved by using a combination of genome analysis, promoter exchange, isotopic labeling experiments, and total synthesis of a focused collection of peptide candidates. Although it belongs to the growing class of D-/ L-peptide natural products, the encoded metabolite kolossin A was found to be largely devoid of antibiotic activity and is likely involved in interspecies communication. A stereoisomer of this peculiar natural product displayed high activity against Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense, a recalcitrant parasite that causes the deadly disease African sleeping sickness.	1
Title: Solution conformation of enopeptin A, a depsipeptide antibiotic, using 2D NMR and restrained molecular dynamics studies Abstract: Studies on the solution conformation of the cyclic depsipeptide antibiotic enopeptin A have been carried out using 2D NMR and molecular modelling techniques. The proton resonances of the antibiotic in DMSO-d6 have been assigned by the use of TOCSY and ROESY experiments. The interproton distance information obtained from the ROESY experiments have been used as the basis for elucidating the probable structures in solution. The restrained molecular dynamics technique was applied to calculate the structures in solution, and six resultant structures with fewer distance constraint violations were obtained that satisfy the experimental restraints very well. The conformation of the cyclic moiety of the molecules is well defined whereas the aliphatic chain segment is disordered.	0
Title: Discovery of Unusual Cyanobacterial Tryptophan-Containing Anabaenopeptins by MS/MS-Based Molecular Networking Abstract: Heterocytous cyanobacteria are among the most prolific sources of bioactive secondary metabolites, including anabaenopeptins (APTs). A terrestrial filamentous Brasilonema sp. CT11 collected in Costa Rica bamboo forest as a black mat, was studied using a multidisciplinary approach: genome mining and HPLC-HRMS/MS coupled with bioinformatic analyses. Herein, we report the nearly complete genome consisting of 8.79 Mbp with a GC content of 42.4%. Moreover, we report on three novel tryptophan-containing APTs; anabaenopeptin 788 (1), anabaenopeptin 802 (2), and anabaenopeptin 816 (3). Furthermore, the structure of two homologues, i.e., anabaenopeptin 802 (2a) and anabaenopeptin 802 (2b), was determined by spectroscopic analysis (NMR and MS). Both compounds were shown to exert weak to moderate antiproliferative activity against HeLa cell lines. This study also provides the unique and diverse potential of biosynthetic gene clusters and an assessment of the predicted chemical space yet to be discovered from this genus.	1
Title: Cloning of the biosynthetic gene cluster for naphthoxanthene antibiotic FD-594 from Streptomyces sp. TA-0256 Abstract: FD-594 is an unique pyrano[4',3':6,7]naphtho[1,2-b]xanthene polyketide with a trisaccharide of 2,6-dideoxysugars. In this study, we cloned the FD-594 biosynthetic gene cluster from the producer strain Streptomyces sp. TA-0256 to investigate its biosynthesis. The identified pnx gene cluster was 38143 bp, consisting of 40 open reading frames, including a minimal PKS gene, TDP-olivose biosynthetic genes, two glycosyltransferase genes, two methyltransferase genes and many oxygenase/reductase genes. Most of these enzymes coded in the pnx cluster were reasonably assigned to a plausible biosynthetic pathway for FD-594, in which an unique ring opening process via Baeyer-Villiger-type oxidation catalyzed by a putative flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD)-dependent monooxygenase, is speculated to lead to the unique xanthene structure. To clarify the involvement of pnx genes in the FD-594 biosynthesis, a glycosyltransferase, PnxGT2, and a methyltransferase, PnxMT2, were characterized enzymatically with the recombinant proteins expressed in Escherichia coli. As a result, PnxGT2 catalyzed the triple olivose transfers to the FD-594 aglycon with TDP-olivose as the glycosyl donor to afford triolivoside. Surprisingly, in the PnxGT2 enzymatic reaction, tetraolivoside and pentaolivoside were significantly detected along with the expected triolivoside. To our knowledge, PnxGT2 is the first contiguous oligosaccharide-forming glycosyltransferase in secondary metabolism. Furthermore, addition of PnxMT2 and S-adenosyl-L-methionine into the PnxGT2 reaction mixture afforded natural FD-594 to confirm that the PnxGT2 reaction product was the expected regiospecifically glycosylated compound. Consequently, the identified pnx gene cluster appears to be involved in FD-594 biosynthesis.	1
Title: Discovery of an Antibacterial Isoindolinone-Containing Tetracyclic Polyketide by Cryptic Gene Activation and Characterization of Its Biosynthetic Gene Cluster Abstract: The major setback in natural product screening is the decreasing hit rate of novel bioactive compounds containing new chemical skeletons. Here we report the identification and biosynthesis of isoindolinomycin (Idm), an unprecedented bioactive polyketide with a novel isoindolinone-containing tetracyclic skeleton. Idm was discovered through the screening of rifampicin-resistant ( rif) mutants that were generated from nine actinomycete strains used in this study. Of the 114 rif mutants isolated, the mutant S55-50-5 was found to overproduce Idm, which is almost undetectable in the wild-type Streptomyces sp. SoC090715LN-16. An in silico analysis coupled with gene deletion experiments revealed a biosynthetic idmB gene cluster that is responsible for the production of Idm. The biosynthetic studies of Idm primarily focused on the formation of the five-membered ring in the tetracyclic structure and the attachment of the methyl group to the core structure. In addition, a malachite green phosphate assay performed using a stand-alone adenylation domain ( idmB21) demonstrated the involvement of glycine in the formation of the isoindolinone-containing skeleton. This study contributes to an increase in the structural diversity of polyketides and paves the way toward an understanding of the complete biosynthetic pathway of a novel class of tetracyclic polyketides.	1
Title: 4-Hydroxy Pyridones from Heterologous Expression and Cultivation of the Native Host Abstract: 4-Hydroxy pyridones are a class of fungi-derived polyketide-nonribosomal peptide products featuring a core of 4-hydroxy-2-pyridone which have a wide range of biological activities. Genome mining of in-house strains using polyketide synthase-nonribosomal peptide synthase as a query identified an endophyte Tolypocladium sp. 49Y, which possesses a potential 4-hydroxy pyridone biosynthetic gene cluster. Heterologous expression in Aspergillus oryzae NSAR1 revealed that this gene cluster is functional and able to produce a rare type of 4-hydroxy pyridones called tolypyridones (compounds 3 and 4). Tolypocladium sp. 49Y was grown in a variety of media which led to the isolation of six 4-hydroxy pyridones (5-10) and one pyrrolidone (11) from a rice culture, and compounds 3 and 9 showed antifungal activity. These latter compounds are different from those obtained by heterologous expression. This study shows that both heterologous expression and cultivation of the native host are complementary approaches to discover new natural products.	1
Title: Expanding the binding envelope of CYP51 inhibitors targeting Trypanosoma cruzi with 4-aminopyridyl-based sulfonamide derivatives Abstract: Chagas disease is a chronic infection caused by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, manifested in progressive cardiomyopathy and/or gastrointestinal dysfunction. Therapeutic options to prevent or treat Chagas disease are limited. CYP51, the enzyme key to the biosynthesis of eukaryotic membrane sterols, is a validated drug target in both fungi and T. cruzi. Sulfonamide derivatives of 4-aminopyridyl-based inhibitors of T. cruzi CYP51 (TcCYP51), including the sub-nanomolar compound 3, have molecular structures distinct from other validated CYP51 inhibitors. They augment the biologically relevant chemical space of molecules targeting TcCYP51. In a 2.08 Å X-ray structure, TcCYP51 is in a conformation that has been influenced by compound 3 and is distinct from the previously characterized ground-state conformation of CYP51 drug-target complexes. That the binding site was modulated in response to an incoming inhibitor for the first time characterizes TcCYP51 as a flexible target rather than a rigid template.	0
Title: Elucidation of final steps of the marineosins biosynthetic pathway through identification and characterization of the corresponding gene cluster Abstract: The marine Streptomyces sp. CNQ-617 produces two diastereomers, marineosins A and B. These are structurally related to alkyl prodiginines, but with a more complex cyclization and an unusual spiroaminal skeleton. We report the identification of the mar biosynthetic gene cluster and demonstrate production of marineosins through heterologous expression in a S. venezuelae host named JND2. The mar cluster shares the same gene organization and has high homology to the genes of the red cluster (which directs the biosynthesis of undecylprodiginine) but contains an additional gene, named marA. Replacement of marA in the JND2 strain leads to the accumulation of premarineosin, which is identical to marineosin with the exception that the middle pyrrole (Ring B) has not been reduced. The final step of the marineosin pathway is thus a MarA catalyzed reduction of this ring. Replacement of marG (a homologue of redG that directs undecylprodiginine cyclization to give streptorubin B) in the JND2 strain leads to the loss of all spiroaminal products and the accumulation of 23-hydroxyundecylprodiginine and a shunt product, 23-ketoundecylprodiginine. MarG thus catalyzes the penultimate step of the marineosin pathway catalyzing conversion of 23-hydroxyundecylprodiginine to premarineosin. The preceding steps of the biosynthetic marineosin pathway likely mirror that in the red-directed biosynthetic process, with the exception of the introduction of the hydroxyl functionality required for spiroaminal formation. This work presents the first experimentally supported scheme for biosynthesis of marineosin and provides a new biologically active molecule, premarineosin.	1
Title: Natural noncanonical protein splicing yields products with diverse β-amino acid residues Abstract: Current textbook knowledge holds that the structural scope of ribosomal biosynthesis is based exclusively on α-amino acid backbone topology. Here we report the genome-guided discovery of bacterial pathways that posttranslationally create β-amino acid-containing products. The transformation is widespread in bacteria and is catalyzed by an enzyme belonging to a previously uncharacterized radical S-adenosylmethionine family. We show that the β-amino acids result from an unusual protein splicing process involving backbone carbon-carbon bond cleavage and net excision of tyramine. The reaction can be used to incorporate diverse and multiple β-amino acids into genetically encoded precursors in Escherichia coli In addition to enlarging the set of basic amino acid components, the excision generates keto functions that are useful as orthogonal reaction sites for chemical diversification.	1
Title: Seeing for speaking: Semantic and lexical information provided by briefly presented, naturalistic action scenes Abstract: At the interface between scene perception and speech production, we investigated how rapidly action scenes can activate semantic and lexical information. Experiment 1 examined how complex action-scene primes, presented for 150 ms, 100 ms, or 50 ms and subsequently masked, influenced the speed with which immediately following action-picture targets are named. Prime and target actions were either identical, showed the same action with different actors and environments, or were unrelated. Relative to unrelated primes, identical and same-action primes facilitated naming the target action, even when presented for 50 ms. In Experiment 2, neutral primes assessed the direction of effects. Identical and same-action scenes induced facilitation but unrelated actions induced interference. In Experiment 3, written verbs were used as targets for naming, preceded by action primes. When target verbs denoted the prime action, clear facilitation was obtained. In contrast, interference was observed when target verbs were phonologically similar, but otherwise unrelated, to the names of prime actions. This is clear evidence for word-form activation by masked action scenes. Masked action pictures thus provide conceptual information that is detailed enough to facilitate apprehension and naming of immediately following scenes. Masked actions even activate their word-form information-as is evident when targets are words. We thus show how language production can be primed with briefly flashed masked action scenes, in answer to long-standing questions in scene processing.	0
Title: Mass spectrometry and the emerging field of glycomics Abstract: The biological significance of protein and lipid glycosylation is well established. For example, cells respond to environmental stimuli by altering glycan structures on their surfaces, and cancer cells evade normal growth regulation in part by remodeling their surface glycans. In general, glycan chemical properties differ significantly from those of proteins, lipids, nucleic acids, and small molecule metabolites. Thus, advances in glycomics, a comprehensive study to identify all glycans in an organism, rely on the development of specialized analytical methods. Mass spectrometry (MS) is emerging as an enabling technology in the field of glycomics. This review summarizes recent developments in mass spectrometric analysis methods for protein-based glycomics and glycoproteomics workflows.	0
Title: Fluoxetine is a potent inhibitor of coxsackievirus replication Abstract: No antiviral drugs currently exist for the treatment of enterovirus infections, which are often severe and potentially life threatening. Molecular screening of small molecule libraries identified fluoxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, as a potent inhibitor of coxsackievirus replication. Fluoxetine did not interfere with either viral entry or translation of the viral genome. Instead, fluoxetine and its metabolite norfluoxetine markedly reduced the synthesis of viral RNA and protein. In view of its favorable pharmacokinetics and safety profile, fluoxetine warrants additional study as a potential antiviral agent for enterovirus infections.	0
Title: Mechanistic studies of Ser/Thr dehydration catalyzed by a member of the LanL lanthionine synthetase family Abstract: Members of the LanL family of lanthionine synthetases consist of three catalytic domains, an N-terminal pSer/pThr lyase domain, a central Ser/Thr kinase domain, and a C-terminal lanthionine cyclase domain. The N-terminal lyase domain has sequence homology with members of the OspF family of effector proteins. In this study, the residues in the lyase domain of VenL that are conserved in the active site of OspF proteins were mutated to evaluate their importance for catalysis. In addition, residues that are fully conserved in the LanL family but not in the OspF family were mutated. Activity assays with these mutant proteins are consistent with a model in which Lys80 in VenL deprotonates the α-proton of pSer/pThr residues to initiate the elimination reaction. Lys51 is proposed to activate this proton by coordination to the carbonyl of the pSer/pThr, and His53 is believed to protonate the phosphate leaving group. These functions are very similar to the corresponding homologous residues in OspF proteins. On the other hand, recognition of the phosphate group of pSer/pThr appears to be achieved differently in VenL than in the OspF proteins. Arg156 and Lys103 are thought to interact with the phosphate group on the basis of a structural homology model.	1
Title: Structure and functional analysis of a marine bacterial carotenoid biosynthesis gene cluster and astaxanthin biosynthetic pathway proposed at the gene level Abstract: A carotenoid biosynthesis gene cluster for the production of astaxanthin was isolated from the marine bacterium Agrobacterium aurantiacum. This cluster contained five carotenogenic genes with the same orientation, which were designated crtW, crtZ, crtY, crtI, and crtB. The stop codons of individual crt genes except for crtB overlapped the start codons of the following crt genes. Escherichia coli transformants carrying the Erwinia uredovora carotenoid biosynthesis genes provide suitable substrates for carotenoid biosynthesis. The functions of the five crt genes of A. aurantiacum were determined through chromatographic and spectroscopic analyses of the pigments accumulated in some E. coli transformants carrying various combinations of the E. uredovora and A. aurantiacum carotenogenic genes. As a result, the astaxanthin biosynthetic pathway is proposed for the first time at the level of the biosynthesis genes. The crtW and crtZ gene products, which mediated the oxygenation reactions from beta-carotene to astaxanthin, were found to have low substrate specificity. This allowed the production of many presumed intermediates of astaxanthin, i.e., adonixanthin, phoenicoxanthin (adonirubin), canthaxanthin, 3'-hydroxyechinenone, and 3-hydroxyechinenone.	1
Title: Acrophiarin (antibiotic S31794/F-1) from Penicillium arenicola shares biosynthetic features with both Aspergillus- and Leotiomycete-type echinocandins Abstract: The antifungal echinocandin lipopeptide, acrophiarin, was circumscribed in a patent in 1979. We confirmed that the producing strain NRRL 8095 is Penicillium arenicola and other strains of P. arenicola produced acrophiarin and acrophiarin analogues. Genome sequencing of NRRL 8095 identified the acrophiarin gene cluster. Penicillium arenicola and echinocandin-producing Aspergillus species belong to the family Aspergillaceae of the Eurotiomycetes, but several features of acrophiarin and its gene cluster suggest a closer relationship with echinocandins from Leotiomycete fungi. These features include hydroxy-glutamine in the peptide core instead of a serine or threonine residue, the inclusion of a non-heme iron, α-ketoglutarate-dependent oxygenase for hydroxylation of the C3 of the glutamine, and a thioesterase. In addition, P. arenicola bears similarity to Leotiomycete echinocandin-producing species because it exhibits self-resistance to exogenous echinocandins. Phylogenetic analysis of the genes of the echinocandin biosynthetic family indicated that most of the predicted proteins of acrophiarin gene cluster exhibited higher similarity to the predicted proteins of the pneumocandin gene cluster of the Leotiomycete Glarea lozoyensis than to those of the echinocandin B gene cluster from A. pachycristatus. The fellutamide gene cluster and related gene clusters are recognized as relatives of the echinocandins. Inclusion of the acrophiarin gene cluster into a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of echinocandin gene clusters indicated the divergent evolutionary lineages of echinocandin gene clusters are descendants from a common ancestral progenitor. The minimal 10-gene cluster may have undergone multiple gene acquisitions or losses and possibly horizontal gene transfer after the ancestral separation of the two lineages.	1
Title: A single cluster of coregulated genes encodes the biosynthesis of the mycotoxins roquefortine C and meleagrin in Penicillium chrysogenum Abstract: A single gene cluster of Penicillium chrysogenum contains genes involved in the biosynthesis and secretion of the mycotoxins roquefortine C and meleagrin. Five of these genes have been silenced by RNAi. Pc21g15480 (rds) encodes a nonribosomal cyclodipeptide synthetase for the biosynthesis of both roquefortine C and meleagrin. Pc21g15430 (rpt) encodes a prenyltransferase also required for the biosynthesis of both mycotoxins. Silencing of Pc21g15460 or Pc21g15470 led to a decrease in roquefortine C and meleagrin, whereas silencing of the methyltransferase gene (Pc21g15440; gmt) resulted in accumulation of glandicolin B, indicating that this enzyme catalyzes the conversion of glandicolin B to meleagrin. All these genes are transcriptionally coregulated. Our results prove that roquefortine C and meleagrin derive from a single pathway.	1
Title: ANTAGONISM OF D-CYCLOSERINE INHIBITION OF MYCOBACTERIAL GROWTH BY D-ALANINE Abstract: Zygmunt, Walter A. (Mead Johnson & Co., Evansville, Ind.). Antagonism of d-cycloserine inhibition of mycobacterial growth by d-alanine. J. Bacteriol. 85:1217-1220. 1963.-Reversal of the antimycobacterial activity of d-4-amino-3-isoxazolidinone (d-cycloserine) by alanine in two species of mycobacteria actively growing on chemically defined media was compared. In both instances, d-alanine was the most effective reversal agent. The specificity with which the d isomer reversed the antimycobacterial activity of d-cycloserine was more pronounced than that observed with other species of bacteria. Mycobactin, a growth factor for certain mycobacteria, showed no reversal activity.	0
Title: Host-Guest Tethered DNA Transducer: ATP Fueled Release of a Protein Inhibitor from Cucurbit[7]uril Abstract: Host-guest complexes are emerging as powerful components in functional systems with applications ranging from materials to biomedicine. In particular, CB7 based host-guest complexes have received much attention for the controlled release of drugs due to the remarkable ability of CB7 toward binding input molecules in water with high affinity leading to displacement of CB7 from included pharmacophores (or from drug loaded porous particles). However, the release of bound guests from CB7 in response to endogenous biological molecules remains limited since the input biomolecule needs to have the appropriate chemical structure to bind tightly into the CB7 cavity. Herein we describe a synthetic transducer based on self-assembling DNA-small molecule chimeras (DCs) that is capable of converting a chosen biological input, adenosine triphosphate (ATP; that does not directly bind to the CB7 host), into functional displacement of a protein inhibitor that is bound within the CB7 host. Our system-which features the first example of a covalent CB-DNA conjugate-is highly modular and can be adapted to enable responsiveness to other biologically/clinically relevant stimuli via its split DNA aptamer architecture.	0
Title: Identification and Characterization of the Streptazone E Biosynthetic Gene Cluster in Streptomyces sp. MSC090213JE08 Abstract: Streptazone derivatives isolated from Streptomyces species are piperidine alkaloids with a cyclopenta[b]pyridine scaffold. Previous studies indicated that these compounds are polyketides, but the biosynthetic enzymes responsible for their synthesis are unknown. Here, we have identified the streptazone E biosynthetic gene cluster in Streptomyces sp. MSC090213JE08, which encodes a modular type I PKS and tailoring enzymes that include an aminotransferase, three oxidoreductases, and two putative cyclases. The functions of the six tailoring enzymes were analyzed by gene disruption, and two putative biosynthetic intermediates that accumulated in particular mutants were structurally elucidated. On the basis of these results, we propose a pathway for the biosynthesis of streptazone E in which the two putative cyclases of the nuclear transport factor 2-like superfamily are responsible for C-C bond formation coupled with epoxide ring opening to give the five-membered ring of streptazone E.	1
Title: Cystobactamids: myxobacterial topoisomerase inhibitors exhibiting potent antibacterial activity Abstract: The development of new antibiotics faces a severe crisis inter alia owing to a lack of innovative chemical scaffolds with activities against Gram-negative and multiresistant pathogens. Herein, we report highly potent novel antibacterial compounds, the myxobacteria-derived cystobactamids 1-3, which were isolated from Cystobacter sp. and show minimum inhibitory concentrations in the low μg mL(-1) range. We describe the isolation and structure elucidation of three congeners as well as the identification and annotation of their biosynthetic gene cluster. By studying the self-resistance mechanism in the natural producer organism, the molecular targets were identified as bacterial type IIa topoisomerases. As quinolones are largely exhausted as a template for new type II topoisomerase inhibitors, the cystobactamids offer exciting alternatives to generate novel antibiotics using medicinal chemistry and biosynthetic engineering.	1
Title: Biosynthetic Studies of Phomopsins Unveil Posttranslational Installation of Dehydroamino Acids by UstYa Family Proteins Abstract: UstYa family proteins (DUF3328) are widely and specifically distributed in fungi. They are known to be involved in the biosynthesis of ribosomally synthesized and posttranslationally modified peptides (RiPPs) and nonribosomal peptides, and possibly catalyze various reactions, including oxidative cyclization and chlorination. In this study, we focused on phomopsin A, a fungal RiPP consisting of unique nonproteinogenic amino acids. Gene knockout experiments demonstrated that three UstYa homologues, phomYc, phomYd, and phomYe, are essential for the desaturation of amino acid moieties, showing unprecedented function among UstYa family proteins. Sequence similarity network analysis indicated that their amino acid sequences are highly diverged and that most remain uncharacterized, paving the way for genome mining of fungal metabolites with unique modifications.	1
Title: HSF1-dependent upregulation of Hsp70 by sulfhydryl-reactive inducers of the KEAP1/NRF2/ARE pathway Abstract: The KEAP1/NRF2/ARE pathway and the heat shock response are inducible cytoprotective systems regulated by transcription factors NRF2 and HSF1, respectively. We report that structurally distinct small molecule NRF2 activators, all of which react with sulfhydryl groups but differ in potency by 15,000-fold, upregulate Hsp70, a prototypic HSF1-dependent gene. Hsp70 upregulation requires HSF1 but is NRF2 independent. We further demonstrate that a sulfoxythiocarbamate inducer conjugates to the negative regulator of HSF1, Hsp90. The differential concentration dependence of the two responses suggests that activation of NRF2 precedes that of HSF1: the KEAP1/NRF2/ARE pathway is at the forefront of cellular defense, protecting against instant danger; the heat shock response closely follows to resolve subsequent potentially devastating damage, saving the proteome. This uncovered duality undoubtedly contributes to the cytoprotective effects of such molecules in models of carcinogenesis, cardiovascular disease, and neurodegeneration.	0
Title: Evolutionary Trajectories for the Functional Diversification of Anthracycline Methyltransferases Abstract: Microbial natural products are an important source of chemical entities for drug discovery. Recent advances in understanding the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites has revealed how this rich chemical diversity is generated through functional differentiation of biosynthetic enzymes. For instance, investigations into anthracycline anticancer agents have uncovered distinct S-adenosyl methionine (SAM)-dependent proteins: DnrK is a 4-O-methyltransferase involved in daunorubicin biosynthesis, whereas RdmB (52% sequence identity) from the rhodomycin pathway catalyzes 10-hydroxylation. Here, we have mined unknown anthracycline gene clusters and discovered a third protein subclass catalyzing 10-decarboxylation. Subsequent isolation of komodoquinone B from two Streptomyces strains verified the biological relevance of the decarboxylation activity. Phylogenetic analysis inferred two independent routes for the conversion of methyltransferases into hydroxylases, with a two-step process involving loss-of-methylation and gain-of-hydroxylation presented here. Finally, we show that simultaneously with the functional differentiation, the evolutionary process has led to alterations in substrate specificities.	1
Title: Identification and characterization of the lysobactin biosynthetic gene cluster reveals mechanistic insights into an unusual termination module architecture Abstract: Lysobactin (katanosin B) is a macrocyclic depsipeptide, displaying high antibacterial activity against human pathogens. In this work, we have identified and characterized the entire biosynthetic gene cluster responsible for lysobactin assembly. Sequential analysis of the Lysobacter sp. ATCC 53042 genome revealed the lysobactin gene cluster to encode two multimodular nonribosomal peptide synthetases. As the number of modules found within the synthetases LybA and LybB directly correlates with the primary sequence of lysobactin, a linear logic of lysobactin biosynthesis is proposed. Investigation of adenylation domain specificities in vitro confirmed the direct association between the synthetases and lysobactin biosynthesis. Furthermore, an unusual tandem thioesterase architecture of the LybB termination module was identified. Biochemical characterization of the individual thioesterases in vitro provides evidence that solely penultimate thioesterase domain mediates the cyclization and simultaneous release of lysobactin.	1
Title: Homolactate fermentation by metabolically engineered Escherichia coli strains Abstract: We report the homofermentative production of lactate in Escherichia coli strains containing mutations in the aceEF, pfl, poxB, and pps genes, which encode the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, pyruvate formate lyase, pyruvate oxidase, and phosphoenolpyruvate synthase, respectively. The process uses a defined medium and two distinct fermentation phases: aerobic growth to an optical density of about 30, followed by nongrowth, anaerobic production. Strain YYC202 (aceEF pfl poxB pps) generated 90 g/liter lactate in 16 h during the anaerobic phase (with a yield of 0.95 g/g and a productivity of 5.6 g/liter . h). Ca(OH)(2) was found to be superior to NaOH for pH control, and interestingly, significant succinate also accumulated (over 7 g/liter) despite the use of N(2) for maintaining anaerobic conditions. Strain ALS961 (YYC202 ppc) prevented succinate accumulation, but growth was very poor. Strain ALS974 (YYC202 frdABCD) reduced succinate formation by 70% to less than 3 g/liter. (13)C nuclear magnetic resonance analysis using uniformly labeled acetate demonstrated that succinate formation by ALS974 was biochemically derived from acetate in the medium. The absence of uniformly labeled succinate, however, demonstrated that glyoxylate did not reenter the tricarboxylic acid cycle via oxaloacetate. By minimizing the residual acetate at the time that the production phase commenced, the process with ALS974 achieved 138 g/liter lactate (1.55 M, 97% of the carbon products), with a yield of 0.99 g/g and a productivity of 6.3 g/liter . h during the anaerobic phase.	0
Title: Biosynthesis of the Immunosuppressant (-)-FR901483 Abstract: We report characterization of the biosynthetic pathway of the potent immunosuppressant (-)-FR901483 (1) through heterologous expression and enzymatic assays. The biosynthetic logic to form the azatricyclic alkaloid is consistent with those proposed in biomimetic syntheses and involves aza-spiro annulation of dityrosyl-piperazine to form a ketoaldehyde intermediate, followed by regioselective aldol condensation, stereoselective ketoreduction, and phosphorylation. A possible target of 1 is proposed based on the biosynthetic studies.	1
Title: Cloning of the staurosporine biosynthetic gene cluster from Streptomyces sp. TP-A0274 and its heterologous expression in Streptomyces lividans Abstract: Staurosporine is a representative member of indolocarbazole antibiotics. The entire staurosporine biosynthetic and regulatory gene cluster spanning 20-kb was cloned from Streptomyces sp. TP-A0274 and sequenced. The gene cluster consists of 14 ORFs and the amino acid sequence homology search revealed that it contains three genes, staO, staD, and staP, coding for the enzymes involved in the indolocarbazole aglycone biosynthesis, two genes, staG and staN, for the bond formation between the aglycone and deoxysugar, eight genes, staA, staB, staE, staJ, staI, staK, staMA, and staMB, for the deoxysugar biosynthesis and one gene, staR is a transcriptional regulator. Heterologous gene expression of a 38-kb fragment containing a complete set of the biosynthetic genes for staurosporine cloned into pTOYAMAcos confirmed its role in staurosporine biosynthesis. Moreover, the distribution of the gene for chromopyrrolic acid synthase, the key enzyme for the biosynthesis of indolocarbazole aglycone, in actinomycetes was investigated, and rebD homologs were shown to exist only in the strains producing indolocarbazole antibiotics.	1
Title: Assessment of microbial communities by graph partitioning in a study of soil fungi in two Alpine meadows Abstract: Understanding how microbial community structure and diversity respond to environmental conditions is one of the main challenges in environmental microbiology. However, there is often confusion between determining the phylogenetic structure of microbial communities and assessing the distribution and diversity of molecular operational taxonomic units (MOTUs) in these communities. This has led to the use of sequence analysis tools such as multiple alignments and hierarchical clustering that are not adapted to the analysis of large and diverse data sets and not always justified for characterization of MOTUs. Here, we developed an approach combining a pairwise alignment algorithm and graph partitioning by using MCL (Markov clustering) in order to generate discrete groups for nuclear large-subunit rRNA gene and internal transcript spacer 1 sequence data sets obtained from a yearly monitoring study of two spatially close but ecologically contrasting alpine soils (namely, early and late snowmelt locations). We compared MCL with a classical single-linkage method (Ccomps) and showed that MCL reduced bias such as the chaining effect. Using MCL, we characterized fungal communities in early and late snowmelt locations. We found contrasting distributions of MOTUs in the two soils, suggesting that there is a high level of habitat filtering in the assembly of alpine soil fungal communities. However, few MOTUs were specific to one location.	0
Title: Generation of novel-substrate-accepting biphenyl dioxygenases through segmental random mutagenesis and identification of residues involved in enzyme specificity Abstract: Aryl-hydroxylating dioxygenases are of interest for the degradation of persistant aromatic pollutants, such as polychlorobiphenyls (PCBs), or as catalysts for the functionalization of aromatic scaffolds. In order to achieve dioxygenation of technical mixtures of PCBs, enzymes with broadened or altered substrate ranges are essential. To alter the substrate specificity of the biphenyl dioxygenase (BphA) of Burkholderia xenovorans LB400, we applied a directed evolution approach that used structure-function relationship data to target random mutageneses to specific segments of the enzyme. The limitation of random amino acid (AA) substitutions to regions that are critical for substrate binding and the exclusion of AA exchanges from positions that are essential for catalytic activity yielded enzyme variants of interest at comparatively high frequencies. After only a single mutagenic cycle, 10 beneficial variants were detected in a library of fewer than 1,000 active enzymes. Compared to the parental BphA, they showed between 5- and 200-fold increased turnover of chlorinated biphenyls, with substituent patterns that rendered them largely recalcitrant to attack by BphA-LB400. Determination of their sequences identified AAs that prevent the acceptance of specific PCBs by the wild-type enzyme, such as Pro334 and Phe384. The results suggest prime targets for subsequent cycles of BphA modification. Correlations with a three-dimensional model of the enzyme indicated that most of the exchanges with major influence on substrate turnover do not involve pocket-lining residues and had not been predictable through structural modeling.	0
Title: Genome mining and functional genomics for siderophore production in Aspergillus niger Abstract: Iron is an essential metal for many organisms, but the biologically relevant form of iron is scarce because of rapid oxidation resulting in low solubility. Simultaneously, excessive accumulation of iron is toxic. Consequently, iron uptake is a highly controlled process. In most fungal species, siderophores play a central role in iron handling. Siderophores are small iron-specific chelators that can be secreted to scavenge environmental iron or bind intracellular iron with high affinity. A second high-affinity iron uptake mechanism is reductive iron assimilation (RIA). As shown in Aspergillus fumigatus and Aspergillus nidulans, synthesis of siderophores in Aspergilli is predominantly under control of the transcription factors SreA and HapX, which are connected by a negative transcriptional feedback loop. Abolishing this fine-tuned regulation corroborates iron homeostasis, including heme biosynthesis, which could be biotechnologically of interest, e.g. the heterologous production of heme-dependent peroxidases. Aspergillus niger genome inspection identified orthologues of several genes relevant for RIA and siderophore metabolism, as well as sreA and hapX. Interestingly, genes related to synthesis of the common fungal extracellular siderophore triacetylfusarinine C were absent. Reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) confirmed the absence of triacetylfusarinine C, and demonstrated that the major secreted siderophores of A. niger are coprogen B and ferrichrome, which is also the dominant intracellular siderophore. In A. niger wild type grown under iron-replete conditions, the expression of genes involved in coprogen biosynthesis and RIA was low in the exponential growth phase but significantly induced during ascospore germination. Deletion of sreA in A. niger resulted in elevated iron uptake and increased cellular ferrichrome accumulation. Increased sensitivity toward phleomycin and high iron concentration reflected the toxic effects of excessive iron uptake. Moreover, SreA-deficiency resulted in increased accumulation of heme intermediates, but no significant increase in heme content. Together with the upregulation of several heme biosynthesis genes, these results reveal a complex heme regulatory mechanism.	1
Title: Prodigiosin biosynthesis gene cluster in the roseophilin producer Streptomyces griseoviridis Abstract: Streptomyces griseoviridis 2464-S5 produces prodigiosin R1, a tripyrrole antibiotic, and roseophilin, a structurally related compound containing two pyrrole and one furan rings. A gene cluster for the biosynthesis of a prodigiosin was identified in S. griseoviridis. The cluster consisted of 24 open reading frames, including 21 genes (rphD-rphZ) homologous to prodigiosin biosynthesis genes in the red cluster in Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2). The expression of rphN in S. coelicolor lacking redN restored the production of prodigiosin.	1
Title: Synthesis of alpha-L-threofuranosyl nucleoside triphosphates (tNTPs) Abstract: [structure: see text] The alpha-l-threofuranosyl nucleoside triphosphates of T, G, and D (tTTP, tGTP, and tDTP) were synthesized from the described 2'-O-DMT-protected derivatives using the Eckstein method, while the corresponding C derivative (tCTP) was prepared from the 2'-O-acetyl derivative. The prepared alpha-l-threofuranosyl nucleoside triphosphates, despite being one carbon shorter than the native 2'-deoxyfuranosyl nucleoside triphosphates, are effective substrates for selected DNA polymerases.	0
Title: Amycolatopsis regifaucium sp. nov., a novel actinomycete that produces kigamicins Abstract: The taxonomic position of seven soil actinomycetes provisionally assigned to the genus Amycolatopsis was established in a polyphasic study. The isolates, which had identical 16S rRNA gene sequences, had closest similarity to the type strain of Amycolatopsis orientalis. A representative isolate, strain GY080T, had chemotaxonomic properties that were typical of the genus Amycolatopsis and could be distinguished from the type strain of A. orientalis using DNA-DNA relatedness data. All of the isolates shared a phenotypic profile that distinguished them from representatives of phylogenetically closely related species. Amplified rDNA restriction analysis showed that the isolates formed a homogeneous group that was distinctly separate from single-membered groups consisting of representative Amycolatopsis type strains, including that of A. orientalis. Based on the combined genotypic and phenotypic evidence, it is proposed that the seven isolates be classified as representatives of a novel species for which the name Amycolatopsis regifaucium sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is GY080T (=DSM 45072T=NCIMB 14277T).	1
Title: Construction of a cellulase hyper-expression system in Trichoderma reesei by promoter and enzyme engineering Abstract: Background:                       Trichoderma reesei is the preferred organism for producing industrial cellulases. However, a more efficient heterologous expression system for enzymes from different organism is needed to further improve its cellulase mixture. The strong cbh1 promoter of T. reesei is frequently used in heterologous expression, however, the carbon catabolite repressor CREI may reduce its strength by binding to the cbh1 promoter at several binding sites. Another crucial point to enhance the production of heterologous enzymes is the stability of recombinant mRNA and the prevention of protein degradation within the endoplasmic reticulum, especially for the bacteria originated enzymes.In this study, the CREI binding sites within the cbh1 promoter were replaced with the binding sites of transcription activator ACEII and the HAP2/3/5 complex to improve the promoter efficiency. To further improve heterologous expression efficiency of bacterial genes within T. reesei, a flexible polyglycine linker and a rigid α-helix linker were tested in the construction of fusion genes between cbh1 from T. reesei and e1, encoding an endoglucanase from Acidothermus cellulolyticus.                  Results:                       The modified promoter resulted in an increased expression level of the green fluorescent protein reporter by 5.5-fold in inducing culture medium and 7.4-fold in repressing culture medium. The fusion genes of cbh1 and e1 were successfully expressed in T. reesei under the control of promoter pcbh1m2. The higher enzyme activities and thermostability of the fusion protein with rigid linker indicated that the rigid linker might be more suitable for the heterologous expression system in T. reesei. Compared to the parent strain RC30-8, the FPase and CMCase activities of the secreted enzyme mixture from the corresponding transformant R1 with the rigid linker increased by 39% and 30% at 60°C, respectively, and the reduced sugar concentration in the hydrolysate of pretreated corn stover (PCS) was dramatically increased by 40% at 55°C and 169% at 60°C when its enzyme mixture was used in the hydrolysis.                  Conclusions:                       This study shows that optimizations of the promoter and linker for hybrid genes can dramatically improve the efficiency of heterologous expression of cellulase genes in T. reesei.	0
Title: Cross-talk between a regulatory small RNA, cyclic-di-GMP signalling and flagellar regulator FlhDC for virulence and bacterial behaviours Abstract: Dickeya dadantii is a globally dispersed phytopathogen which causes diseases on a wide range of host plants. This pathogen utilizes the type III secretion system (T3SS) to suppress host defense responses, and secretes pectate lyase (Pel) to degrade the plant cell wall. Although the regulatory small RNA (sRNA) RsmB, cyclic diguanylate monophosphate (c-di-GMP) and flagellar regulator have been reported to affect the regulation of these two virulence factors or multiple cell behaviours such as motility and biofilm formation, the linkage between these regulatory components that coordinate the cell behaviours remain unclear. Here, we revealed a sophisticated regulatory network that connects the sRNA, c-di-GMP signalling and flagellar master regulator FlhDC. We propose multi-tiered regulatory mechanisms that link the FlhDC to the T3SS through three distinct pathways including the FlhDC-FliA-YcgR3937 pathway; the FlhDC-EcpC-RpoN-HrpL pathway; and the FlhDC-rsmB-RsmA-HrpL pathway. Among these, EcpC is the most dominant factor for FlhDC to positively regulate T3SS expression.	0
Title: Synergistic Interactions in Microbial Biofilms Facilitate the Establishment of Opportunistic Pathogenic Fungi in Household Dishwashers Abstract: Biofilms formed on rubber seals in dishwashers harbor diverse microbiota. In this study, we focussed on the microbial composition of bacteria and fungi, isolated from a defined area of one square centimeter of rubber from four domestic dishwashers and assessed their abilities to in vitro multispecies biofilm formation. A total of 80 isolates (64 bacterial and 16 fungal) were analyzed. Multiple combinations of bacterial isolates from each dishwasher were screened for synergistic interactions. 32 out of 140 tested (23%) four-species bacterial combinations displayed consistent synergism leading to an overall increase in biomass, in all experimental trails. Bacterial isolates from two of the four dishwashers generated a high number of synergistically interacting four-species consortia. Network based correlation analyses also showed higher co-occurrence patterns observed between bacterial members in the same two dishwasher samples, indicating cooperative effects. Furthermore, two synergistic four-species bacterial consortia were tested for their abilities to incorporate an opportunistic fungal pathogen, Exophiala dermatitidis and their establishment as biofilms on sterile ethylene propylene diene monomer M-class (EPDM) rubber and polypropylene (PP) surfaces. When the bacterial consortia included E. dermatitidis, the overall cell numbers of both bacteria and fungi increased and a substantial increase in biofilm biomass was observed. These results indicate a novel phenomenon of cross kingdom synergy in biofilm formation and these observations could have potential implications for human health.	0
Title: Quorum-sensing crosstalk-driven synthetic circuits: from unimodality to trimodality Abstract: Widespread quorum-sensing (QS) enables bacteria to communicate and plays a critical role in controlling bacterial virulence. However, effects of promiscuous QS crosstalk and its implications for gene regulation and cell decision-making remain largely unknown. Here we systematically studied the crosstalk between LuxR/I and LasR/I systems and found that QS crosstalk can be dissected into signal crosstalk and promoter crosstalk. Further investigations using synthetic positive feedback circuits revealed that signal crosstalk significantly decreases a circuit's bistable potential while maintaining unimodality. Promoter crosstalk, however, reproducibly generates complex trimodal responses resulting from noise-induced state transitions and host-circuit interactions. A mathematical model that integrates the circuit's nonlinearity, stochasticity, and host-circuit interactions was developed, and its predictions of conditions for trimodality were verified experimentally. Combining synthetic biology and mathematical modeling, this work sheds light on the complex behaviors emerging from QS crosstalk, which could be exploited for therapeutics and biotechnology.	0
Title: Analysis of the tetronomycin gene cluster: insights into the biosynthesis of a polyether tetronate antibiotic Abstract: The biosynthetic gene cluster for tetronomycin (TMN), a polyether ionophoric antibiotic that contains four different types of ring, including the distinctive tetronic acid moiety, has been cloned from Streptomyces sp. NRRL11266. The sequenced tmn locus (113 234 bp) contains six modular polyketide synthase (PKS) genes and a further 27 open-reading frames. Based on sequence comparison to related biosynthetic gene clusters, the majority of these can be assigned a plausible role in TMN biosynthesis. The identity of the cluster, and the requirement for a number of individual genes, especially those hypothesised to contribute a glycerate unit to the formation of the tetronate ring, were confirmed by specific gene disruption. However, two large genes that are predicted to encode together a multifunctional PKS of a highly unusual type seem not to be involved in this pathway since deletion of one of them did not alter tetronomycin production. Unlike previously characterised polyether PKS systems, oxidative cyclisation appears to take place on the modular PKS rather than after transfer to a separate carrier protein, while tetronate ring formation and concomitant chain release share common mechanistic features with spirotetronate biosynthesis.	1
Title: Microbial features of mature and abandoned soils in refractory clay deposits Abstract: Processes of soil restoration in anthropogenically disturbed soils is an urgent topic in modern ecology and nature management. Being mediator between mineral soil composition and plant vegetation, soil microbial community is important factor of soil restoration processes. Analysis of main soil nutrition components followed by 16S amplicon sequencing are sufficient methods for primary analysis of novel locations. Here is the primary analysis in a novel location in Northwest Europe (Russia). Main nutrition parameters (pH, P, Na and NH4+) and 16S rDNA Illumina amplicons were explored in abandoned soils from sandy pit quarry (2 sites) and refractory clay mining dumps (4 sites).Microbial communities of mature soils and dumps are variable and different in terms both nutritional and microbial components. pH, N and TOC are strong predictors for microbial composition. Dumps of refractory clays pQ_2 are non-developed soils, highly acidic and form specific microbial community. Differences between dumps and mature soils in both pre-quaternary and quaternary soils are connected with specific bacterial taxa. Those taxa are connected more with plant composition, not the soil properties themselves. The exact changes in microbial community are unique for different soils and areas.	0
Title: Antimycobacterial Rufomycin Analogues from Streptomyces atratus Strain MJM3502 Abstract: This study represents a systematic chemical and biological study of the rufomycin (RUF) class of cyclic heptapeptides, which our anti-TB drug discovery efforts have identified as potentially promising anti-TB agents that newly target the caseinolytic protein C1, ClpC1. Eight new RUF analogues, rufomycins NBZ1-NBZ8 (1-8), as well as five known peptides (9-13) were isolated and characterized from the Streptomyces atratus strain MJM3502. Advanced Marfey's and X-ray crystallographic analysis led to the assignment of the absolute configuration of the RUFs. Several isolates exhibited potent activity against both pathogens M. tuberculosis H37Rv and M. abscessus, paired with favorable selectivity (selectivity index >60), which collectively underscores the promise of the rufomycins as potential anti-TB drug leads.	0
Title: Initiation of actinorhodin export in Streptomyces coelicolor Abstract: Many microorganisms produce molecules having antibiotic activity and expel them into the environment, presumably enhancing their ability to compete with their neighbours. Given that these molecules are often toxic to the producer, mechanisms must exist to ensure that the assembly of the export apparatus accompanies or precedes biosynthesis. Streptomyces coelicolor produces the polyketide antibiotic actinorhodin in a multistep pathway involving enzymes encoded by genes that are clustered together. Embedded within the cluster are genes for actinorhodin export, two of which, actR and actA resemble the classic tetR and tetA repressor/efflux pump-encoding gene pairs that confer resistance to tetracycline. Like TetR, which represses tetA, ActR is a repressor of actA. We have identified several molecules that can relieve repression by ActR. Importantly (S)-DNPA (an intermediate in the actinorhodin biosynthetic pathway) and kalafungin (a molecule related to the intermediate dihydrokalafungin), are especially potent ActR ligands. This suggests that along with the mature antibiotic(s), intermediates in the biosynthetic pathway might activate expression of the export genes thereby coupling export to biosynthesis. We suggest that this could be a common feature in the production of many bioactive natural products.	1
Title: Discovery of pentangular polyphenols hexaricins A-C from marine Streptosporangium sp. CGMCC 4.7309 by genome mining Abstract: Many novel microbial nature products were discovered from Actinobacteria by genome mining methods. However, only a few number of genome mining works were carried out in rare actinomycetes. An important reason precluding the genome mining efforts in rare actinomycetes is that most of them are recalcitrant to genetic manipulation. Herein, we chose the rare marine actinomycete Streptosporangium sp. CGMCC 4.7309 to explore its secondary metabolite diversity by genome mining. The genetic manipulation method has never been established for Streptosporangium strains. At first, we set up the genetic system of Streptosporangium sp. CGMCC 4.7309 unprecedentedly. The draft genome sequencing of Streptosporangium sp. CGMCC 4.7309 revealed that it contains more than 20 cryptic secondary metabolite biosynthetic clusters. A type II polyketide synthases-containing cluster (the hex cluster) was predicted to encode compounds with a pentangular polyphenol scaffold by in silico analysis. The products of the hex cluster were uncovered by comparing the metabolic profile of Streptosporangium sp. CGMCC 4.7309 with that of the hex30 inactivated mutant, in which a key ketoreductase gene was disrupted. Finally, three pentangular polyphenols were isolated and named as hexaricins A (1), B (2), and C (3). The inconsistency of the stereochemistry of C-15 in hexaricins A, B, and C indicates a branch point in their biosynthesis. Finally, the biosynthetic pathway of the hexaricins was proposed based on bioinformatics analysis.	1
Title: New alpha-amylase inhibitor, trestatins. I. Isolation, characterization and biological activities of trestatins A, B and C Abstract: Trestatin complex which exhibited a potent inhibitory activity on various alpha-amylases has been isolated from the culture filtrate of Streptomyces dimorphogenes nov. sp. NR-320-OM7HB. Three major components, trestatins A, B and C, have been purified by adsorption and ion-exchange chromatography. Their spectral and chemical properties suggested that trestatins were novel basic oligosaccharide homologues each characterized by the possession of a trehalose moiety at the non-reducing end of the molecule.	0
Title: Cloning and heterologous expression of a natural product biosynthetic gene cluster from eDNA Abstract: [reaction: see text] To study the natural products produced by uncultured microorganisms, an environmental DNA (eDNA) cosmid library was constructed and screened for the heterologous production of small molecules. A blue clone, CSL51, found in the eDNA library produces deoxyviolacein and the broad spectrum antibiotic violacein. The full sequence of the 6.7 kb eDNA violacein gene cluster and the characterization of violacein and deoxyviolacein from an eDNA clone are reported here.	1
Title: Efficient Room-Temperature Activation of Methane by TaN(+) under C-N Coupling Abstract: The thermal reaction of diatomic tantalum nitride cation [TaN](+) with methane has been explored using FT-ICR mass spectrometry complemented by high-level quantum chemical calculation; based on this combined experimental/computational approach, mechanistic aspects of this novel, highly efficient C-N coupling process have been uncovered. In distinct contrast to [TaN](+) , its lighter congeners [VN](+) and [NbN](+) are inert towards methane under ambient conditions, and the origins of the remarkably variable efficiencies of the three metal nitrides are uncovered by CCSD(T) calculations.	0
Title: A Novel Type Pathway-Specific Regulator and Dynamic Genome Environments of a Solanapyrone Biosynthesis Gene Cluster in the Fungus Ascochyta rabiei Abstract: Secondary metabolite genes are often clustered together and situated in particular genomic regions, like the subtelomere, that can facilitate niche adaptation in fungi. Solanapyrones are toxic secondary metabolites produced by fungi occupying different ecological niches. Full-genome sequencing of the ascomycete Ascochyta rabiei revealed a solanapyrone biosynthesis gene cluster embedded in an AT-rich region proximal to a telomere end and surrounded by Tc1/Mariner-type transposable elements. The highly AT-rich environment of the solanapyrone cluster is likely the product of repeat-induced point mutations. Several secondary metabolism-related genes were found in the flanking regions of the solanapyrone cluster. Although the solanapyrone cluster appears to be resistant to repeat-induced point mutations, a P450 monooxygenase gene adjacent to the cluster has been degraded by such mutations. Among the six solanapyrone cluster genes (sol1 to sol6), sol4 encodes a novel type of Zn(II)2Cys6 zinc cluster transcription factor. Deletion of sol4 resulted in the complete loss of solanapyrone production but did not compromise growth, sporulation, or virulence. Gene expression studies with the sol4 deletion and sol4-overexpressing mutants delimited the boundaries of the solanapyrone gene cluster and revealed that sol4 is likely a specific regulator of solanapyrone biosynthesis and appears to be necessary and sufficient for induction of the solanapyrone cluster genes. Despite the dynamic surrounding genomic regions, the solanapyrone gene cluster has maintained its integrity, suggesting important roles of solanapyrones in fungal biology.	1
Title: Identification and transcriptional organization of aerobactin transport and biosynthesis cluster genes of Vibrio hollisae Abstract: We had previously reported that Vibrio hollisae produces aerobactin in response to iron starvation. In the present study, we identified in V. hollisae ATCC33564 the aerobactin system cluster which consists of eight genes, hatCDB, iucABCD and iutA. The hatCDB genes encode proteins homologous to components of bacterial ATP binding cassette transport systems for ferric aerobactin. The iucABCD and iutA orthologs code for aerobactin biosynthesis enzymes and the ferric aerobactin receptor, respectively. In accordance with their iron-regulated expression, putative Fur box sequences were found within the respective promoter regions of hatC, iucA and iutA. The monocistronic iutA transcript was detected by northern blotting. Moreover, phenotypic comparison between the wild-type strain and its targeted gene disruptants supported the biological functions that were expected for the respective operons and genes on the basis of the homology search. The arrangement of the aerobactin gene clusters thus far found in Vibrio and enterobacterial species was compared and discussed from an evolutionary point of view.	1
Title: Involvement of β-Alkylation Machinery and Two Sets of Ketosynthase-Chain-Length Factors in the Biosynthesis of Fogacin Polyketides in Actinoplanes missouriensis Abstract: Fogacin and two novel fogacin derivatives, fogacins B and C, were isolated from the rare actinomycete Actinoplanes missouriensis. Biosynthesis of fogacin C apparently requires β alkylation of a polyketide chain. The fogacin biosynthetic type II polyketide synthase (PKS) gene cluster contains a hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A synthase (HCS) cassette, which is usually responsible for β alkylation in the type I PKS system. Another characteristic of the fog cluster is that it encodes two sets of ketosynthase (KS) and chain-length factor (CLF). Inactivation of either of the two KS genes in A. missouriensis and heterologous expression of the HCS cassette with either of the two KS-CLF genes in Streptomyces albus indicated that each KS-CLF had a different starter substrate specificity: one preferred an unusual β-alkylated starter and the other preferred a normal acetyl starter. This study expands knowledge of HCS cassette-dependent β alkylation into the type II PKS system and provides a natural example of combinatorial biosynthesis for producing diverse polyketides from different starter substrates.	1
Title: Expression and purification of the 5'-nucleotidase YitU from Bacillus species: its enzymatic properties and possible applications in biotechnology Abstract: 5'-Nucleotidases (EC 3.1.3.5) are enzymes that catalyze the hydrolytic dephosphorylation of 5'-ribonucleotides and 5'-deoxyribonucleotides to their corresponding nucleosides plus phosphate. In the present study, to search for new genes encoding 5'-nucleotidases specific for purine nucleotides in industrially important Bacillus species, "shotgun" cloning and the direct selection of recombinant clones grown in purine nucleosides at inhibitory concentrations were performed in the Escherichia coli GS72 strain, which is sensitive to these compounds. As a result, orthologous yitU genes from Bacillus subtilis and Bacillus amyloliquefaciens, whose products belong to the ubiquitous haloacid dehalogenase superfamily (HADSF), were selected and found to have a high sequence similarity of 87%. B. subtilis YitU was produced in E. coli as an N-terminal hexahistidine-tagged protein, purified and biochemically characterized as a soluble 5'-nucleotidase with broad substrate specificity with respect to various deoxyribo- and ribonucleoside monophosphates: dAMP, GMP, dGMP, CMP, AMP, XMP, IMP and 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-β-D-ribofuranosyl 5'-monophosphate (AICAR-P). However, the preferred substrate for recombinant YitU was shown to be flavin mononucleotide (FMN). B. subtilis and B. amyloliquefaciens yitU overexpression increased riboflavin (RF) and 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleoside (AICAR) accumulation and can be applied to breed highly performing RF- and AICAR-producing strains.	0
Title: Decoding cyclase-dependent assembly of hapalindole and fischerindole alkaloids Abstract: The formation of C-C bonds in an enantioselective fashion to create complex polycyclic scaffolds in the hapalindole- and fischerindole- type alkaloids from Stigonematales cyanobacteria represents a compelling and urgent challenge in adapting microbial biosynthesis as a catalytic platform in drug development. Here we determine the biochemical basis for tri- and tetracyclic core formation in these secondary metabolites, involving a new class of cyclases that catalyze a complex cyclization cascade.	1
Title: Electron spin echo studies of the copper complexes of conalbumin Abstract: Electron spin echo envelope spectroscopy was used to probe the two metal binding sites of Cu(II)-conalbumin. The echo envelope spectrum of Cu(II)-conalbumin-oxalate, with metal ion at either one or both of the binding sites, contains lines arising from the interaction of the electron spin of Cu(II) with bound imidazole, demonstrating histidine ligation to the metal ion. The 13C superhyperfine interaction of bound [13C]oxalate, obtained from the ratio of the electron spin echo envelopes of Cu(II)-conalbumin-[13C]oxalate to that of Cu(II)-conalbumin-[12C]oxalate, is about twice the free precession frequency and indicates a contact interaction between 13C and Cu(II). This study indicates that oxalate is directly coordinated to the metal ion. Over the pH range 7.0 to 10.0, where Cu(II)-conalbumin binds carbonate as an associated anion, the echo envelope spectrum indicates that at least one imidazole ligand is coordinated to Cu(II). Below pH 6.0 and above pH 11.0, imidazole coordination is not observed.	0
Title: Identification and characterization of pltZ, a gene involved in the repression of pyoluteorin biosynthesis in Pseudomonas sp. M18 Abstract: A new regulator gene named pltZ, which is located downstream of the plt gene cluster in the genome of Pseudomonas sp. M18, was identified, sequenced and characterized in this report. The deduced amino acid sequence of PltZ shares significant homology with other bacterial regulators in the TetR family. The chromosomal pltZ disruption mutant gave rise to 4.4-fold enhancement of pyoluteorin biosynthesis but did not exert significant influence on the accumulation of phenazine-1-carboxylic acid compared with the wild-type M18. The negative regulation of pltZ on pyoluteorin biosynthesis was further confirmed by multiplied pltZ gene dosage experiments and pltA'-'lacZ translational fusion analyses.	1
Title: On a psychophysical transformed-rule up and down method converging on a 75% level of correct responses Abstract: Transformed-rule up and down psychophysical methods have gained great popularity, mainly because they combine criterion-free responses with an adaptive procedure allowing rapid determination of an average stimulus threshold at various criterion levels of correct responses. The statistical theory underlying the methods now in routine use is based on sets of consecutive responses with assumed constant probabilities of occurrence. The response rules requiring consecutive responses prevent the possibility of using the most desirable response criterion, that of 75% correct responses. The earliest transformed-rule up and down method, whose rules included nonconsecutive responses, did not contain this limitation but failed to become generally accepted, lacking a published theoretical foundation. Such a foundation is provided in this article and is validated empirically with the help of experiments on human subjects and a computer simulation. In addition to allowing the criterion of 75% correct responses, the method is more efficient than the methods excluding nonconsecutive responses in their rules.	0
Title: Diazaquinomycin Biosynthetic Gene Clusters from Marine and Freshwater Actinomycetes Abstract: Tuberculosis is an infectious disease of global concern. Members of the diazaquinomycin (DAQ) class of natural products have shown potent and selective activity against drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis. However, poor solubility has prevented further development of this compound class. Understanding DAQ biosynthesis may provide a viable route for the generation of derivatives with improved properties. We have sequenced the genomes of two actinomycete bacteria that produce distinct DAQ derivatives. While software tools for automated biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) prediction failed to detect DAQ BGCs, comparative genomics using MAUVE alignment led to the identification of putative BGCs in the marine Streptomyces sp. F001 and in the freshwater Micromonospora sp. B006. Deletion of the identified daq BGC in strain B006 using CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing abolished DAQ production, providing experimental evidence for BGC assignment. A complete model for DAQ biosynthesis is proposed based on the genes identified. Insufficient knowledge of natural product biosynthesis is one of the major challenges of productive genome mining approaches. The results reported here fill a gap in knowledge regarding the genetic basis for the biosynthesis of DAQ antibiotics. Moreover, identification of the daq BGC shall enable future generations of improved derivatives using biosynthetic methods.	1
Title: Chemical knockout of pantothenate kinase reveals the metabolic and genetic program responsible for hepatic coenzyme A homeostasis Abstract: Coenzyme A (CoA) is the major acyl group carrier in intermediary metabolism. Hopantenate (HoPan), a competitive inhibitor of the pantothenate kinases, was used to chemically antagonize CoA biosynthesis. HoPan dramatically reduced liver CoA and mice developed severe hypoglycemia. Insulin was reduced, glucagon and corticosterone were elevated, and fasting accelerated hypoglycemia. Metabolic profiling revealed a large increase in acylcarnitines, illustrating the role of carnitine in buffering acyl groups to maintain the nonesterified CoASH level. HoPan triggered significant changes in hepatic gene expression that substantially increased the thioesterases, which liberate CoASH from acyl-CoA, and increased pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1, which prevents the conversion of CoASH to acetyl-CoA. These results identify the metabolic rearrangements that maintain the CoASH pool which is critical to mitochondrial functions, including gluconeogenesis, fatty acid oxidation, and the tricarboxylic acid and urea cycles.	0
Title: Stress signalling to fungal stress-activated protein kinase pathways Abstract: The ability of microorganisms to survive and thrive within hostile environments depends on rapid and robust stress responses. Stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK) pathways are important stress-signalling modules found in all eukaryotes, including eukaryotic microorganisms such as fungi. These pathways consist of a SAPK that is activated by phosphorylation through a kinase cascade, and once activated, the SAPK phosphorylates a range of cytoplasmic and nuclear target substrates, which determine the appropriate response. However, despite their conservation in fungi, mechanisms that have evolved to relay stress signals to the SAPK module in different fungi have diverged significantly. Here, we present an overview of the diverse strategies used in the model yeasts Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe, and the pathogenic fungus Candida albicans, to sense and transduce stress signals to their respective SAPKs.	0
Title: Simultaneous determination of the total number of aquatic bacteria and the number thereof involved in respiration Abstract: The electron transport system of respiring organisms reduces 2-(p-iodophenyl)-3-(p-nitrophenyl)-5-phenyl tetrazolium chloride (INT) to INT-formazan. Respiring bacteria deposit accumulated INT-formazan intracellularly as dark red spots. Corresponding to electron transport system activity, these deposits attain a size and a degree of optical density which allows them to be examined by light microscopy. If polycarbonate filters and epifluorescence microscopy are applied to analyze an INT-treated water sample, it is possible to differentiate between respiring and apparently nonrespiring bacteria. This differentiation, which permits determinations of the total number of bacteria and the proportion thereof involved in respiration, is realized directly within one and the same microscopic image. Initial applications of the present method for hydrobiological purposes showed that the proportion of respiring aquatic bacteria ranged between 6 to 12% (samples taken from coastal areas of the Baltic Sea) and 5 to 36% (samples taken from freshwater lakes and ponds). Cells of 1.6 to 2.4 micrometer (freshwater) and 0.4 micrometer (Baltic Sea) account for the highest proportion of respiring bacteria.	0
Title: Biosynthesis of the dichloroacetyl component of chloramphenicol in Streptomyces venezuelae ISP5230: genes required for halogenation Abstract: Five ORFs were detected in a fragment from the Streptomyces venezuelae ISP5230 genomic DNA library by hybridization with a PCR product amplified from primers representing a consensus of known halogenase sequences. Sequencing and functional analyses demonstrated that ORFs 11 and 12 (but not ORFs 13-15) extended the partially characterized gene cluster for chloramphenicol (Cm) biosynthesis in the chromosome. Disruption of ORF11 (cmlK) or ORF12 (cmlS) and conjugal transfer of the insertionally inactivated genes to S. venezuelae gave mutant strains VS1111 and VS1112, each producing a similar series of Cm analogues in which unhalogenated acyl groups replaced the dichloroacetyl substituent of Cm. 1H-NMR established that the principal metabolite in the disrupted strains was the alpha-N-propionyl analogue. The sequence of CmlK implicated the protein in adenylation, and involvement in halogenation was inferred from biosynthesis of analogues by the cmlK-disrupted mutant. A role in generating the dichloroacetyl substituent was supported by partial restoration of Cm biosynthesis when a cloned copy of cmlK was introduced in trans into VS1111. Complementation of the mutant also indicated that inactivation of cmlK rather than a polar effect of the disruption on cmlS expression had interfered with dichloroacetyl biosynthesis. The deduced CmlS sequence resembled sequences of FADH2-dependent halogenases. Conjugal transfer of cmlK or cmlS into S. venezuelae cml-2, a chlorination-deficient strain with a mutation mapped genetically to the Cm biosynthesis gene cluster, did not complement the cml-2 lesion, suggesting that one or more genes in addition to cmlK and cmlS is needed to assemble the dichloroacetyl substituent. Insertional inactivation of ORF13 did not affect Cm production, and the products of ORF14 and ORF15 matched Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) proteins lacking plausible functions in Cm biosynthesis. Thus cmlS appears to mark the downstream end of the gene cluster.	1
Title: A theoretical study on NHC-catalysed enantioselective cycloaddition of ketenes and 3-aroylcoumarins: mechanism and enantioselectivity Abstract: NHC-catalysed enantioselective cycloaddition of ketenes to 3-aroylcoumarins to yield dihydrocoumarin-fused dihydropyranones has been investigated using DFT methods at the B3LYP/6-31G* and MPWB1K/6-311G** computational levels. Two plausible mechanisms have been studied: the "ketene-first" mechanism A and the "coumarin-first" mechanism B. An analysis of the activation Gibbs free energies involved in the two competitive pathways makes it possible to rule out the pathway associated with the "coumarin-first" mechanism B. The first step of the "ketene-first" mechanism A is the formation of zwitterionic intermediate IN1-Zvia a nucleophilic attack of NHC 1 on ketene 2. A [4 + 2] cycloaddition through the nucleophilic attack of enolate IN1-Z on the conjugated double bond of the benzoyl group of coumarin 3, viaTS3-SS-a2 or TS3-RR-a2, yields IN3. Finally, the extrusion of the catalyst through TS5 leads to the final products, either 4-SS or 4-RR. Enantioselectivity observed in the experimental results is determined in the transition states TS3-SS-a2/TS3-RR-a2. In this pathway, the intramolecular hydrogen-bonding between the hydroxyl group of the IN1-Z adduct and the carbonyl oxygen of the original ketene group directs the final stereochemistry throughout the entire process.	0
Title: ALDH2 mediates 5-nitrofuran activity in multiple species Abstract: Understanding how drugs work in vivo is critical for drug design and for maximizing the potential of currently available drugs. 5-nitrofurans are a class of prodrugs widely used to treat bacterial and trypanosome infections, but despite relative specificity, 5-nitrofurans often cause serious toxic side effects in people. Here, we use yeast and zebrafish, as well as human in vitro systems, to assess the biological activity of 5-nitrofurans, and we identify a conserved interaction between aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) 2 and 5-nitrofurans across these species. In addition, we show that the activity of nifurtimox, a 5-nitrofuran anti-trypanosome prodrug, is dependent on zebrafish Aldh2 and is a substrate for human ALDH2. This study reveals a conserved and biologically relevant ALDH2-5-nitrofuran interaction that may have important implications for managing the toxicity of 5-nitrofuran treatment.	0
Title: Discovery of a pathway for terminal-alkyne amino acid biosynthesis Abstract: Living systems can generate an enormous range of cellular functions, from mechanical infrastructure and signalling networks to enzymatic catalysis and information storage, using a notably limited set of chemical functional groups. This observation is especially notable when compared to the breadth of functional groups used as the basis for similar functions in synthetically derived small molecules and materials. The relatively small cross-section between biological and synthetic reactivity space forms the foundation for the development of bioorthogonal chemistry, in which the absence of a pair of reactive functional groups within the cell allows for a selective in situ reaction1-4. However, biologically 'rare' functional groups, such as the fluoro5, chloro6,7, bromo7,8, phosphonate9, enediyne10,11, cyano12, diazo13, alkene14 and alkyne15-17 groups, continue to be discovered in natural products made by plants, fungi and microorganisms, which offers a potential route to genetically encode the endogenous biosynthesis of bioorthogonal reagents within living organisms. In particular, the terminal alkyne has found broad utility via the Cu(I)-catalysed azide-alkyne cycloaddition 'click' reaction18. Here we report the discovery and characterization of a unique pathway to produce a terminal alkyne-containing amino acid in the bacterium Streptomyces cattleya. We found that L-lysine undergoes an unexpected reaction sequence that includes halogenation, oxidative C-C bond cleavage and triple bond formation through a putative allene intermediate. This pathway offers the potential for de novo cellular production of halo-, alkene- and alkyne-labelled proteins and natural products from glucose for a variety of downstream applications.	1
Title: Characterization of an autoinhibitory domain in human mitogen-activated protein kinase-activated protein kinase 2 Abstract: Mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase-activated protein kinase 2, a Ser/Thr kinase, is phosphorylated and activated by MAP kinase. Sequence analysis of a clone isolated from the human HL-60 cell line revealed a 370-amino acid protein with a proline-rich N terminus, a highly conserved catalytic domain, and a C-terminal region containing a MAP kinase phosphorylation site. To better understand how the kinase is regulated, mutation analysis was used to map the functional domain(s). The wild type recombinant kinase had a low basal activity as detected by phosphorylation of a substrate peptide derived from the N terminus of glycogen synthase. Deletion of the proline-rich N terminus showed little effect on the basal activity. Deletion of the C terminus resulted in a marked increase in catalytic activity either with or without the pretreatment of the kinase by MAP kinase. Further analysis indicated that amino acid residues 339-353 in the C-terminal region were acting as an autoinhibitory domain. A synthetic peptide (RVLKEDKERWEDVK-amide) derived from this autoinhibitory domain inhibited the kinase activity in a concentration-dependent manner. These results suggest a regulatory model for the kinase.	0
Title: Identification and characterization of the spiruchostatin biosynthetic gene cluster enable yield improvement by overexpressing a transcriptional activator Abstract: Spiruchostatins A and B are members of the FK228-family of natural products with potent histone deacetylase inhibitory activities and antineoplastic activities. However, their production in the wild-type strain of Pseudomonas sp. Q71576 is low. To improve the yield, the spiruchostatin biosynthetic gene cluster (spi) was first identified by rapid genome sequencing and characterized by genetic mutations. This spi gene cluster encodes a hybrid biosynthetic pathway similar to that encoded by the FK228 biosynthetic gene cluster (dep) in Chromobacterium violaceum No. 968. Each gene cluster contains a pathway regulatory gene (spiR vs. depR), but these two genes encode transcriptional activators of different classes. Overexpression of native spiR or heterologous depR in the wild-type strain of Pseudomonas sp. Q71576 resulted in 268 or 1,285 % increase of the combined titer of spiruchostatins A and B, respectively. RT-PCR analysis indicates that overexpression of heterologous depR upregulates the expression of native spiR.	1
Title: Going forward laterally: transmembrane passage of hydrophobic molecules through protein channel walls Abstract: Regular phospholipid bilayers do not pose efficient barriers for the transport of hydrophobic molecules. The outer membrane (OM) surrounding Gram-negative bacteria is a nontypical, asymmetric bilayer with an outer layer of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The sugar molecules of the LPS layer prevent spontaneous diffusion of hydrophobic molecules across the OM. As regular OM channels such as porins do not allow passage of hydrophobic molecules, specialized OM transport proteins are required for their uptake. Such proteins, exemplified by channels of the FadL family, transport their substrates according to a lateral diffusion mechanism. Here, substrates diffuse from the lumen of the beta-barrel laterally into the OM, through a stable opening in the wall of the barrel. In this way, the lipopolysaccharide barrier is bypassed and, by depositing the substrates into the OM, a driving force for uptake is provided. Lateral diffusion through protein channel walls also occurs in alpha-helical inner membrane proteins, and could represent a widespread mechanism for proteins that transport and interact with hydrophobic substrates.	0
Title: Characterization of the gene cluster involved in the biosynthesis of macedocin, the lantibiotic produced by Streptococcus macedonicus Abstract: Streptococcus macedonicus ACA-DC 198, a food-grade isolate from naturally fermented Greek Kasseri cheese, produces a lantibiotic named macedocin that has been previously purified and characterized. In the present study, a 15,171 bp region in the S. macedonicus ACA-DC 198 chromosome, containing the biosynthetic gene cluster of macedocin, has been sequenced. This region consists of 10 ORFs, which correspond to the genes (mcd genes) involved in macedocin biosynthesis, regulation and immunity. The mcd genes are organized in two operons and their role is predicted on the basis of similarities to genes of known lantibiotics. Compared with its closest match, the streptococcin A-FF22 gene cluster, the macedocin one contains an additional structural gene and an insertion sequence between the regulatory and the biosynthetic operons.	1
Title: Genome Mining of Micromonospora yangpuensis DSM 45577 as a Producer of an Anthraquinone-Fused Enediyne Abstract: A new anthraquinone-fused enediyne, yangpumicin A (YPM A, 1), along with four Bergman cyclization congeners (YPM B-E, 2-5), was isolated from Micromonospora yangpuensis DSM 45577 after mining enediyne biosynthetic gene clusters from public actinobacterial genome databases and prioritizing the hits by an enediyne genome neighborhood network analysis for discovery. YPM A is potent against a broad spectrum of human cancer cell lines. The discovery of 1 provides new opportunities for the functionalization of enediynes to develop new conjugation chemistries for antibody-drug conjugates.	1
Title: PURIFICATION AND CHARACTERIZATION OF STAPHYLOCOAGULASE Abstract: Zolli, Zeno, Jr. (Michigan State University, East Lansing), and Charles L. San Clemente. Purification and characterization of staphylocoagulase. J. Bacteriol. 86:527-535. 1963.-Separation and extreme purification of coagulase from Staphylococcus aureus strain 70 was achieved by using three cycles of dialysis in ethanol-water mixtures under controlled conditions, followed by molecular sieving through a column of Sephadex G-200. By manipulation of five variables (pH, ionic strength, temperature, protein, and ethanol concentration), the final preparation showed an approximate 3700-fold increase in activity per mg of protein. The successfully isolated coagulase containing 15.0% nitrogen was characterized serologically and chemically. By use of agar diffusion techniques, one zone of precipitation was obtained with the highly purified material. Additional confirmation of purity was evidenced by the appearance of a single peak with cellulose acetate paper electrophoresis with a barbital buffer at pH 8.6. Progressive and eventual elimination of carbohydrate, deoxyribonuclease, lipase, and phosphatase was observed through the four stages of purification. Temperature studies showed that the stability of each fraction was inversely related to its purity.	0
Title: Bioorthogonally Applicable Fluorescence Deactivation Strategy for Receptor Kinetics Study and Theranostic Pretargeting Approaches Abstract: The availability of a receptor for theranostic pretargeting approaches was assessed by use of a new click-chemistry-based deactivatable fluorescence-quenching concept. The efficacy was evaluated in a cell-based model system featuring both membranous (available) and internalized (unavailable) receptor fractions of the clinically relevant receptor chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4). Proof of concept was achieved with a deactivatable tracer consisting of a CXCR4-specific peptide functionalized with a Cy5 dye bearing a chemoselective azide handle (N3 -Cy5-AcTZ14011). Treatment with a Cy7 quencher dye (Cy7-DBCO) resulted in optically silent Cy7-[click]-Cy5-AcTZ14011. In situ, a >90 % FRET-based reduction of the signal intensity of N3 -Cy5-AcTZ14011 [KD =(222.4±25.2) nm] was seen within minutes after quencher addition. In cells, discrimination between the membranous and the internalized receptor fraction could be achieved through quantitative assessment of quenching/internalization kinetics. Similar evaluation of an activatable tracer variant based on the same targeting moiety (Cy5-S-S-Cy3-AcTZ14011) was unsuccessful in vitro. As such, using the described deactivatable approach to screen membrane receptors and their applicability in receptor-(pre-)targeted theranostics can become straightforward.	0
Title: Isolation and structural characterization of capistruin, a lasso peptide predicted from the genome sequence of Burkholderia thailandensis E264 Abstract: Lasso peptides are a structurally unique class of bioactive peptides characterized by a knotted arrangement, where the C-terminus threads through an N-terminal macrolactam ring. Although ribosomally synthesized, only the gene cluster for the best studied lasso peptide MccJ25 from Escherichia coli consisting of the precursor protein McjA and the processing and immunity proteins McjB, McjC, and McjD is known. Through genome mining studies, we have identified homologues of all four proteins in Burkholderia thailandensis E264 and predicted this strain to produce a lasso peptide. Here we report the successful isolation of the predicted peptide, named capistruin. Upon optimization of the fermentation conditions, mass spectrometric and NMR structural studies proved capistruin to adopt a novel lasso fold. Heterologous production of the lasso peptide in Escherichia coli showed that the identified genes are sufficient for the biosynthesis of capistruin, which exhibits antimicrobial activity against closely related Burkholderia and Pseudomonas strains. In general, our rational approach should be widely applicable for the isolation of new lasso peptides to explore their high structural stability and diverse biological activity.	1
Title: High cell density perfusion process for high yield of influenza A virus production using MDCK suspension cells Abstract: Similar to the recent COVID-19 pandemic, influenza A virus poses a constant threat to the global community. For the treatment of flu disease, both antivirals and vaccines are available with vaccines the most effective and safest approach. In order to overcome limitations in egg-based vaccine manufacturing, cell culture-based processes have been established. While this production method avoids egg-associated risks in face of pandemics, process intensification using animal suspension cells in high cell density perfusion cultures should allow to further increase manufacturing capacities worldwide. In this work, we demonstrate the development of a perfusion process using Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) suspension cells for influenza A (H1N1) virus production from scale-down shake flask cultivations to laboratory scale stirred tank bioreactors. Shake flask cultivations using semi-perfusion mode enabled high-yield virus harvests (4.25 log10(HAU/100 μL)) from MDCK cells grown up to 41 × 106 cells/mL. Scale-up to bioreactors with an alternating tangential flow (ATF) perfusion system required optimization of pH control and implementation of a temperature shift during the infection phase. Use of a capacitance probe for on-line perfusion control allowed to minimize medium consumption. This contributed to a better process control and a more economical performance while maintaining a maximum virus titer of 4.37 log10(HAU/100 μL) and an infectious virus titer of 1.83 × 1010 virions/mL. Overall, this study clearly demonstrates recent advances in cell culture-based perfusion processes for next-generation high-yield influenza vaccine manufacturing for pandemic preparedness. KEY POINTS: • First MDCK suspension cell-based perfusion process for IAV produciton was established. • "Cell density effect" was overcome and process was intensified by reduction of medium use and automated process control. • The process achieved cell density over 40 × 106 cells/mL and virus yield over 4.37 log10(HAU/100 μL).	0
Title: A gene cluster for biosynthesis of kanamycin from Streptomyces kanamyceticus: comparison with gentamicin biosynthetic gene cluster Abstract: Gene clusters for the biosynthesis of kanamycin (Km) and gentamicin (Gm) were isolated from the genomic libraries of Streptomyces kanamyceticus and Micromonospora echinospora, respectively. The sequencing of the 47 kb-region of S. kanamyceticus genomic DNA revealed 40 putative open reading frames (ORFs) encoding Km biosynthetic proteins, regulatory proteins, and resistance and transport proteins. Similarly, the sequencing of 32.6 kb genomic DNA of M. echinospora revealed a Gm biosynthetic gene cluster flanked by resistant genes. Biosynthetic pathways for the formation of Km were proposed by the comparative study of biosynthetic genes. Out of 12 putative Km biosynthetic genes, kanA was expressed in Escherichia coli and determined its function as a 2-deoxy-scyllo-inosose synthase. Furthermore, the acetylations of aminoglycoside-aminocyclitols (AmAcs) by Km acetyltransferase (KanM) were also demonstrated. The acetylated derivatives completely lost their antibacterial activities against Bacillus subtilis. The comparative genetic studies of Gm, Km, tobramycin (Tm), and butirosin (Bn) reveal their similar biosynthetic routes and provide a framework for the further biosynthetic studies.	1
Title: Three previously unrecognised classes of biosynthetic enzymes revealed during the production of xenovulene A Abstract: Xenovulene A is a complex fungal meroterpenoid, produced by the organism hitherto known as Acremonium strictum IMI 501407, for which limited biosynthetic evidence exists. Here, we generate a draft genome and show that the producing organism is previously unknown and should be renamed as Sarocladium schorii. A biosynthetic gene cluster is discovered which bears resemblance to those involved in the biosynthesis of fungal tropolones, with additional genes of unknown function. Heterologous reconstruction of the entire pathway in Aspergillus oryzae allows the chemical steps of biosynthesis to be dissected. The pathway shows very limited similarity to the biosynthesis of other fungal meroterpenoids. The pathway features: the initial formation of tropolone intermediates; the likely involvement of a hetero Diels-Alder enzyme; a terpene cyclase with no significant sequence homology to any known terpene cyclase and two enzymes catalysing oxidative-ring contractions.	1
Title: Community dynamics and functional characteristics of naphthalene-degrading populations in contaminated surface sediments and hypoxic/anoxic groundwater Abstract: Earlier research on the biogeochemical factors affecting natural attenuation in coal-tar contaminated groundwater, at South Glens Falls, NY, revealed the importance of anaerobic metabolism and trophic interactions between degrader and bacterivore populations. Field-based characterizations of both phenomena have proven challenging, but advances in stable isotope probing (SIP), single-cell imaging and shotgun metagenomics now provide cultivation-independent tools for their study. We tracked carbon from 13 C-labelled naphthalene through microbial populations in contaminated surface sediments over 6 days using respiration assays, secondary ion mass spectrometry imaging and shotgun metagenomics to disentangle the contaminant-based trophic web. Contaminant-exposed communities in hypoxic/anoxic groundwater were contrasted with those from oxic surface sediments to identify putative features of anaerobic catabolism of naphthalene. In total, six bacteria were responsible for naphthalene degradation. Cupriavidus, Ralstonia and Sphingomonas predominated at the earliest stages of SIP incubations and were succeeded in later stages by Stenotrophomonas and Rhodococcus. Metagenome-assembled genomes provided evidence for the ecological and functional characteristics underlying these temporal shifts. Identical species of Stenotrophomonas and Rhodococcus were abundant in the most contaminated, anoxic groundwater. Apparent increases in bacterivorous protozoa were observed following exposure to naphthalene, though insignificant amounts of carbon were transferred between bacterial degraders and populations of secondary feeders.	0
Title: Phosphine-Activated Lysine Analogues for Fast Chemical Control of Protein Subcellular Localization and Protein SUMOylation Abstract: The Staudinger reduction and its variants have exceptional compatibility with live cells but can be limited by slow kinetics. Herein we report new small-molecule triggers that turn on proteins through a Staudinger reduction/self-immolation cascade with substantially improved kinetics and yields. We achieved this through site-specific incorporation of a new set of azidobenzyloxycarbonyl lysine derivatives in mammalian cells. This approach allowed us to activate proteins by adding a nontoxic, bioorthogonal phosphine trigger. We applied this methodology to control a post-translational modification (SUMOylation) in live cells, using native modification machinery. This work significantly improves the rate, yield, and tunability of the Staudinger reduction-based activation, paving the way for its application in other proteins and organisms.	0
Title: Cloning and characterization of a female genital complex cDNA from the liver fluke Fasciola hepatica Abstract: A cDNA clone whose RNA is abundant in the female genital complex of the liver fluke Fasciola hepatica has been isolated from a cDNA library in lambda gt10 by differential screening. The pattern of expression in different fluke tissues and at different stages of miracidium formation suggests that this gene is expressed in the F. hepatica vitelleria. The nucleotide sequence of the cloned cDNA was determined and the primary structure of the putative protein was deduced. The proposed protein is rich in glycine, lysine, and tyrosine and its overall amino acid composition agrees with that reported for the F. hepatica egg shell. The clone has homology with DNA from other trematodes; this homology is higher in organisms in which egg development is similar to that of F. hepatica and suggests that the protein is conserved in organisms in which miracidium formation occurs in fresh water.	0
Title: Development of an alkaloid-pyrone annulation: synthesis of pleiomaltinine Abstract: Odd Couple:                       Methodology for the synthesis of alkaloid-pyrones using a novel pyrone annulation of β–carbolines and indoles with 3-siloxy-4-pyrones is reported. The approach has enabled semisynthesis of the unprecedented alkaloid-pyrone pleiomaltinine from the plant-derived indole-alkaloid pleiocarpamine.	0
Title: Genomics-Driven Discovery of NO-Donating Diazeniumdiolate Siderophores in Diverse Plant-Associated Bacteria Abstract: Siderophores are key players in bacteria-host interactions, with the main function to provide soluble iron for their producers. Gramibactin from rhizosphere bacteria expands siderophore function and diversity as it delivers iron to the host plant and features an unusual diazeniumdiolate moiety for iron chelation. By mutational analysis of the grb gene cluster, we identified genes (grbD and grbE) necessary for diazeniumdiolate formation. Genome mining using a GrbD-based network revealed a broad range of orthologous gene clusters in mainly plant-associated Burkholderia/Paraburkholderia species. Two new types of diazeniumdiolate siderophores, megapolibactins and plantaribactin were fully characterized. In vitro assays and in vivo monitoring experiments revealed that the iron chelators also liberate nitric oxide (NO) in plant roots. This finding is important since NO donors are considered as biofertilizers that maintain iron homeostasis and increase overall plant fitness.	1
Title: Insects represent a link between food animal farms and the urban environment for antibiotic resistance traits Abstract: Antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections result in higher patient mortality rates, prolonged hospitalizations, and increased health care costs. Extensive use of antibiotics as growth promoters in the animal industry represents great pressure for evolution and selection of antibiotic-resistant bacteria on farms. Despite growing evidence showing that antibiotic use and bacterial resistance in food animals correlate with resistance in human pathogens, the proof for direct transmission of antibiotic resistance is difficult to provide. In this review, we make a case that insects commonly associated with food animals likely represent a direct and important link between animal farms and urban communities for antibiotic resistance traits. Houseflies and cockroaches have been shown to carry multidrug-resistant clonal lineages of bacteria identical to those found in animal manure. Furthermore, several studies have demonstrated proliferation of bacteria and horizontal transfer of resistance genes in the insect digestive tract as well as transmission of resistant bacteria by insects to new substrates. We propose that insect management should be an integral part of pre- and postharvest food safety strategies to minimize spread of zoonotic pathogens and antibiotic resistance traits from animal farms. Furthermore, the insect link between the agricultural and urban environment presents an additional argument for adopting prudent use of antibiotics in the food animal industry.	0
Title: Cell-specific RNA aptamer against human CCR5 specifically targets HIV-1 susceptible cells and inhibits HIV-1 infectivity Abstract: The C-C chemokine receptor type 5 (CCR5) is a receptor expressed by T cells and macrophages that serves as a coreceptor for macrophage-tropic HIV-1. Loss of CCR5 is associated with resistance to HIV-1. Here, we combine the live-cell-based SELEX with high-throughput sequencing technology to generate CCR5 RNA aptamers capable of specifically targeting HIV-1 susceptible cells (as small interfering RNA [siRNA] delivery agent) and inhibiting HIV-1 infectivity (as antiviral agent) via block of the CCR5 required for HIV-1 to enter cells. One of the best candidates, G-3, efficiently bound and was internalized into human CCR5-expressing cells. The G-3 specifically neutralized R5 virus infection in primary peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and in vivo generated human CD4(+) T cells with a nanomolar inhibitory concentration 50%. G-3 was also capable of transferring functional siRNAs to CCR5-expressing cells. Collectively, the cell-specific, internalizing, CCR5-targeted aptamers and aptamer-siRNA conjugates offer promise for overcoming some of the current challenges of drug resistance in HIV-1 by providing cell-type- or tissue-specific delivery of various therapeutic moieties.	0
Title: Colorimetric Carbonyl Sulfide (COS)/Hydrogen Sulfide (H2 S) Donation from γ-Ketothiocarbamate Donor Motifs Abstract: Hydrogen sulfide (H2 S) is a biologically active molecule that exhibits protective effects in a variety of physiological and pathological processes. Although several H2 S-related biological effects have been discovered by using H2 S donors, knowing how much H2 S has been released from donors under different conditions remains challenging. Now, a series of γ-ketothiocarbamate (γ-KetoTCM) compounds that provide the first examples of colorimetric H2 S donors and enable direct quantification of H2 S release, were reported. These compounds are activated through a pH-dependent deprotonation/β-elimination sequence to release carbonyl sulfide (COS), which is quickly converted into H2 S by carbonic anhydrase. The p-nitroaniline released upon donor activation provides an optical readout that correlates directly to COS/H2 S release, thus enabling colorimetric measurement of H2 S donation.	0
Title: Synthesis, characterization, and studies on DNA binding of the complex Fe(Sal(2)dienNO(3).H(2)O) Abstract: A new metal complex, Fe(Sal(2)dienNO(3).H2O) (where Sal is salicylaldehyde and dien is diethylenetriamine), has been synthesized and characterized. The interactions between the Fe(III) complex and calf thymus DNA has been investigated using UV and fluorescence spectra, viscosity, thermal denaturation, and molecular modeling. The cleavage reaction on plasmid DNA has been monitored by agarose gel electrophoresis. The experimental results show that the mode of binding of the complex to DNA is classical intercalation and the complex can cleave pBR322 DNA.	0
Title: Activation and characterization of a cryptic gene cluster reveals a cyclization cascade for polycyclic tetramate macrolactams Abstract: Polycyclic tetramate macrolactams (PTMs) are a growing class of natural products and are derived from a hybrid polyketide synthase (PKS)/non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) pathway. PTM biosynthetic gene clusters are conserved and widely distributed in bacteria, however, most of them remain silent. Herein we report the activation of a PTM gene cluster in marine-derived Streptomyces pactum SCSIO 02999 by promoter engineering and heterologous expression, leading to the discovery of six new PTMs, pactamides A-F (11-16), with potent cytotoxic activity upon several human cancer cell lines. In vivo gene disruption experiments and in vitro biochemical assays reveal a reductive cyclization cascade for polycycle formation, with reactions sequentially generating the 5, 5/5 and 5/5/6 carbocyclic ring systems, catalysed by the phytoene dehydrogenase PtmB2, the oxidoreductase PtmB1, and the alcohol dehydrogenase PtmC, respectively. Furthermore, PtmC was demonstrated as a bifunctional cyclase for catalyzing the formation of the inner five-membered ring in ikarugamycin. This study suggests the possibility of finding more bioactive PTMs by genome mining and discloses a general mechanism for the formation of 5/5/6-type carbocyclic rings in PTMs.	1
Title: Chemoenzymatic synthesis and Fcγ receptor binding of homogeneous glycoforms of antibody Fc domain. Presence of a bisecting sugar moiety enhances the affinity of Fc to FcγIIIa receptor Abstract: Structurally well-defined IgG-Fc glycoforms are highly demanded for understanding the effects of glycosylation on an antibody's effector functions. We report in this paper chemoenzymatic synthesis and Fcγ receptor binding of an array of homogeneous IgG-Fc glycoforms. The chemoenzymatic approach consists of the chemical synthesis of defined N-glycan oxazolines as donor substrates, the expression of the Fc domain in a CHO cell line in the presence of an α-mannosidase inhibitor kifunensine, and an endoglycosidase-catalyzed glycosylation of the deglycosylated Fc domain (GlcNAc-Fc homodimer) with the synthetic glycan oxazolines. The enzyme from Arthrobacter protophormiae (Endo-A) was found to be remarkably efficient to take various modified N-glycan core oxazolines, including the bisecting sugar-containing derivatives, for Fc glycosylation remodeling, resulting in the formation of the corresponding homogeneous Fc glycoforms. Nevertheless, neither Endo-A nor the Mucor hiemalis endoglycosidase mutants (EndoM-N175A and EndoM-N175Q) were able to transfer full-length complex-type N-glycan to the Fc domain, implicating the limitations of these two enzymes in Fc glycosylation remodeling. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) binding studies with the synthetic IgG-Fc glycoforms unambiguously proved that the presence of a bisecting GlcNAc moiety could significantly enhance the binding of Fc to FcγRIIIa, the activating Fcγ receptor, independent of Fc core-fucosylation. Interestingly, the Fc glycoforms carrying an unusual bisecting sugar moiety such as a mannose or a LacNAc moiety also demonstrated enhanced affinity to FcγRIIIa. On the orther hand, the presence of a bisecting GlcNAc or core-fucosylation had little effect on the affinity of Fc to the inhibitory Fcγ receptor, FcγRIIb. Our experimental data also showed that the α-linked mannose residues in the pentasaccharide Man3GlcNAc2 core was essential to maintain a high affinity of Fc to both FcγRIIIa and FcγRIIb. The synthetic homogeneous Fc glycoforms thus provide a useful tool for elucidating how a fine Fc N-glycan structure precisely affects the function of the Fc domain.	0
Title: The Biogenetic Origin of the Biologically Active Naematolin of Hypholoma Species Involves an Unusual Sesquiterpene Synthase Abstract: Naematolin is a biologically active sesquiterpene produced by Hypholoma species. Low titres and complex structure constrain the exploitation of this secondary metabolite. Here, we de novo sequenced the H. fasciculare genome to identify a candidate biosynthetic gene cluster for production of naematolin. Using Aspergillus oryzae as a heterologous host for gene expression, the activity of several sesquiterpene synthases were investigated, highlighting one atypical sesquiterpene synthase apparently capable of catalysing the 1,11 and subsequent 2,10 ring closures, which primes the synthesis of the distinctive structure of caryophyllene derivatives. Co-expression of the cyclase with an FAD oxidase adjacent within the gene cluster generated four oxidised caryophyllene-based sesquiterpenes: 5β,6α,8β-trihydroxycariolan, 5β,8β-dihydroxycariolan along with two previously unknown caryophyllene derivatives 2 and 3. This represents the first steps towards heterologous production of such basidiomycete-derived caryophyllene-based sesquiterpenes, opening a venue for potential novel antimicrobials via combinatorial biosynthesis.	1
Title: Modification of the second translation initiation site restricts the replication of foot-and-mouth disease virus in PK-15 cells Abstract: The translation initiation of foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) occurs at two alternative initiation sites (Lab AUG and Lb AUG). Usually, the Lb AUG is more favorably used to initiate protein synthesis than the Lab AUG. To explore the effect of Lb AUG on FMDV replication and obtain FMDV with restricted replication, this initiation codon was mutated to a variety of non-AUG codons (UGG, AUC, CUG, and AAA). Fortunately, the modifications did not prevent viral viability but influenced replication characteristics of some FMDV mutants in a cell-specific manner, as was shown by the similar replication in BHK-21 cells and delayed growth kinetics in PK-15 cells. This attenuated phenotype of FMDV mutants in PK-15 cells was found to be correlated with reduced abilities to cleave eIF4GI and suppress interference (IFN) expression. As leader (L) protein was reported to be responsible for eIF4GI cleavage and inhibition of IFN expression, the in vivo L protein synthesis was examined during the infection of FMDV mutants. Our results showed that not only the total yield of L proteins was severely influenced but also the individual yield of L protein was seen to be affected, which implied that both the relative usage of the two initiation sites and overall translation efficiency were changed by Lb AUG modifications. In addition, the in vitro translation activity was also negatively regulated by Lb AUG mutations. Collectively, these findings suggested that the restricted replications of Lb AUG-modified FMDVs were related to the delayed eIF4GI cleavage and decreased ability to block IFN expression but were mainly determined by the inefficient translation initiation. FMDVs precisely with modifications of Lb AUG initiation codon may represent safer seed viruses for vaccine production. KEY POINTS: • The polyprotein translation of FMDV initiates at two alternative initiation sites (Lab AUG and Lb AUG). In order to explore the effect of Lb AUG on FMDV replication and obtain FMDV with restricted replication, the Lb initiation AUG was mutated to a variety of non-AUG codons (UGG, AUC, CUG, and AAA), and four FMDV mutants with Lb AUG modification were generated. • We found that partial FMDV mutants grew almost as well as WT virus in BHK-21 cells, a typical cell line used for FMD vaccine production, but displayed impaired replication in IFN-competent PK-15 cells. • The attenuation of mutant FMDVs in PK-15 cells was found to be correlated with delayed eIF4GI cleavage and decreased ability to block IFN expression. • We proved that the attenuated phenotype of Lb AUG-modified FMDVs was mainly determined by the inefficient translation initiation, as demonstrated by the decrease of total yield of L proteins and individual production of L protein. • We successfully generated genetically engineered FMDV with attenuated phenotype. The approach of precise engineering of FMDV with the modification of initiation codon provides a safe platform to produce inactivated antigen vaccines.	0
Title: Protein folding, protein collapse, and tanford's transfer model: lessons from single-molecule FRET Abstract: The essential and nontrivial role of the denatured state of proteins in their folding reaction is being increasingly scrutinized in recent years. Single molecule FRET (smFRET) experiments show that the denatured state undergoes a continuous collapse (or coil-to-globule) transition as the concentration of a chemical denaturant is decreased, suggesting that conformational entropy of the denatured state is an important part of the free energy of folding. Such observations question the validity of the classical Tanford transfer model, which suggests that the folding free energy can be understood solely based on the difference in amino acid solvation between the folded state and a fixed unfolded state. An alternative to the transfer model is obtained here from a polymer theoretical analysis of a series of published smFRET data. The analysis shows that the free energy of denatured-state collapse has a linear dependence on denaturant concentration, an outcome of the interplay between enthalpic and entropic contributions. Surprisingly, the slope of the free energy of collapse agrees very well with the respective slope of the free energy of folding. This conformity of values obtained from two very different measurements shows that it is the collapse transition in the denatured state which mediates the effect of denaturants on folding. The energetics of folding are thus governed by the competition of solvation and conformational entropy in the denatured state.	0
Title: Characterisation of the paralytic shellfish toxin biosynthesis gene clusters in Anabaena circinalis AWQC131C and Aphanizomenon sp. NH-5 Abstract: Background:                       Saxitoxin and its analogues collectively known as the paralytic shellfish toxins (PSTs) are neurotoxic alkaloids and are the cause of the syndrome named paralytic shellfish poisoning. PSTs are produced by a unique biosynthetic pathway, which involves reactions that are rare in microbial metabolic pathways. Nevertheless, distantly related organisms such as dinoflagellates and cyanobacteria appear to produce these toxins using the same pathway. Hypothesised explanations for such an unusual phylogenetic distribution of this shared uncommon metabolic pathway, include a polyphyletic origin, an involvement of symbiotic bacteria, and horizontal gene transfer.                  Results:                       We describe the identification, annotation and bioinformatic characterisation of the putative paralytic shellfish toxin biosynthesis clusters in an Australian isolate of Anabaena circinalis and an American isolate of Aphanizomenon sp., both members of the Nostocales. These putative PST gene clusters span approximately 28 kb and contain genes coding for the biosynthesis and export of the toxin. A putative insertion/excision site in the Australian Anabaena circinalis AWQC131C was identified, and the organization and evolution of the gene clusters are discussed. A biosynthetic pathway leading to the formation of saxitoxin and its analogues in these organisms is proposed.                  Conclusion:                       The PST biosynthesis gene cluster presents a mosaic structure, whereby genes have apparently transposed in segments of varying size, resulting in different gene arrangements in all three sxt clusters sequenced so far. The gene cluster organizational structure and sequence similarity seems to reflect the phylogeny of the producer organisms, indicating that the gene clusters have an ancient origin, or that their lateral transfer was also an ancient event. The knowledge we gain from the characterisation of the PST biosynthesis gene clusters, including the identity and sequence of the genes involved in the biosynthesis, may also afford the identification of these gene clusters in dinoflagellates, the cause of human mortalities and significant financial loss to the tourism and shellfish industries.	1
Title: Curcuminoids block TGF-β signaling in human breast cancer cells and limit osteolysis in a murine model of breast cancer bone metastasis Abstract: Effects of curcuminoids on breast cancer cell secretion of the bone-resorptive peptide parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) and on lytic breast cancer bone metastasis were evaluated. In vitro, transforming growth factor (TGF)-β-stimulated PTHrP secretion was inhibited by curcuminoids (IC50 = 24 μM) in MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells independent of effects on cell growth inhibition. Effects on TGF-β signaling revealed decreases in phospho-Smad2/3 and Ets-1 protein levels with no effect on p-38 MAPK-mediated TGF-β signaling. In vivo, mice were inoculated with MDA-MB-231 cells into the left cardiac ventricle and treated ip every other day with curcuminoids (25 or 50 mg/kg) for 21 days. Osteolytic bone lesion area was reduced up to 51% (p < 0.01). Consistent with specific effects on bone osteolysis, osteoclast number at the bone-tumor interface was reduced up to 53% (p < 0.05), while tumor area within bone was unaltered. In a separate study, tumor mass in orthotopic mammary xenografts was also unaltered by treatment. These data suggest that curcuminoids prevent TGF-β induction of PTHrP and reduce osteolytic bone destruction by blockade of Smad signaling in breast cancer cells.	0
Title: Characterization of CmaA, an adenylation-thiolation didomain enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of coronatine Abstract: Several pathovars of Pseudomonas syringae produce the phytotoxin coronatine (COR), which contains an unusual amino acid, the 1-amino-2-ethylcyclopropane carboxylic acid called coronamic acid (CMA), which is covalently linked to a polyketide-derived carboxylic acid, coronafacic acid, by an amide bond. The region of the COR biosynthetic gene cluster proposed to be responsible for CMA biosynthesis was resequenced, and errors in previously deposited cmaA sequences were corrected. These efforts allowed overproduction of P. syringae pv. glycinea PG4180 CmaA in P. syringae pv. syringae FF5 as a FLAG-tagged protein and overproduction of P. syringae pv. tomato CmaA in Escherichia coli as a His-tagged protein; both proteins were in an enzymatically active form. Sequence analysis of CmaA indicated that there were two domains, an adenylation domain (A domain) and a thiolation domain (T domain). ATP-(32)PP(i) exchange assays showed that the A domain of CmaA catalyzes the conversion of branched-chain L-amino acids and ATP into the corresponding aminoacyl-AMP derivatives, with a kinetic preference for L-allo-isoleucine. Additional experiments demonstrated that the T domain of CmaA, which is posttranslationally modified with a 4'-phosphopantetheinyl group, reacts with the AMP derivative of L-allo-isoleucine to produce an aminoacyl thiolester intermediate. This covalent species was detected by incubating CmaA with ATP and L-[G-(3)H]allo-isoleucine, followed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis. It is postulated that the L-allo-isoleucine covalently tethered to CmaA serves as the substrate for additional enzymes in the CMA biosynthetic pathway that catalyze cyclopropane ring formation, which is followed by thiolester hydrolysis, yielding free CMA. The availability of catalytically active CmaA should facilitate elucidation of the details of the subsequent steps in the formation of this novel cyclopropyl amino acid.	1
Title: Characterization of the highly immunogenic VP2 protrusion domain as a diagnostic antigen for members of Birnaviridae family Abstract: Birnaviridae is a family of viruses (birnaviruses) which consists of four genera, members of which cause diseases in fish, birds, mollusks, and insects. The genome of birnaviruses encodes the highly immunogenic VP2 capsid protein. In order to demonstrate that the VP2 protein can be exploited as a diagnostic antigen for birnaviruses, we developed a lateral flow assay based on the surface-exposed VP2 protrusion domain of a representative birnavirus, infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) of serotype 1 which causes the highly devastating infectious bursal disease in chickens. The biophysical characterization of the purified domain reveals that the domain predominantly consists of β-sheets, exists in a trimeric form, and remains folded at high temperatures, making it suitable for diagnostic purposes. Owing to its highly immunogenic nature and excellent biophysical properties, we employed the VP2 protrusion domain in a gold nanoparticle-based lateral flow assay for rapid detection of anti-IBDV antibodies in serum samples of infected chickens. Our results indicate that the domain binds anti-IBDV antibodies with high specificity during laboratory testing and on-site testing. The lateral flow assay reported here yields comparable results in a qualitative manner as obtained through a commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). As VP2 is a common capsid protein of birnaviruses, the lateral flow assay can be generalized for other birnaviruses, and members of Tetraviridae and Nodaviridae families which contain homologous VP2 capsid proteins.	0
Title: Cross-Platform DNA Encoding for Single-Cell Imaging of Gene Expression Abstract: Integration of imaging data across different molecular target types can provide in-depth insight into cell physiology and pathology, but remains challenging owing to poor compatibility between target-type-specific labeling methods. We show that cross-platform imaging analysis can be readily achieved through DNA encoding of molecular targets, which translates the molecular identity of various target types into a uniform in situ array of ssDNA tags for subsequent labeling with complementary imaging probes. The concept was demonstrated through multiplexed imaging of mRNAs and their corresponding proteins with multicolor quantum dots. The results reveal heterogeneity of cell transfection with siRNA and outline disparity in RNA interference (RNAi) kinetics at the level of both the mRNA and the encoded protein.	0
Title: Characterization of Tailoring Methyltransferases Involved in K-41A Biosynthesis: Modulating Methylation to Improve K-41A Anti-infective Activity Abstract: The biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) for polyether antibiotic K-41A was identified from marine-derived Streptomyces sp. SCSIO 01680 and subjected to combinatorial biosynthetic study. Bioinformatics analyses, gene disruption, and metabolomics analyses afforded eight new derivatives and one known polyether, showcasing five region-specific methyltransferases Pak13, Pak15, Pak20, Pak31, and Pak38 and their respective modification loci. Moreover, bioassays revealed that two disaccharide-bearing polyethers, K-41B and K-41Bm, display enhanced anti-HIV and potent antibacterial activities.	1
Title: Discovery of Alternative Producers of the Enediyne Antitumor Antibiotic C-1027 with High Titers Abstract: The potent cytotoxicity and unique mode of action make the enediyne antitumor antibiotic C-1027 an exquisite drug candidate for anticancer chemotherapy. However, clinical development of C-1027 has been hampered by its low titer from the original producer Streptomyces globisporus C-1027. Here we report three new C-1027 alternative producers, Streptomyces sp. CB00657, CB02329, and CB03608, from The Scripps Research Institute actinomycetes strain collection. Together with the previously disclosed Streptomyces sp. CB02366 strain, four C-1027 alternative producers with C-1027 titers of up to 11-fold higher than the original producer have been discovered. The five C-1027 producers, isolated from distant geographic locations, are distinct Streptomyces strains based on morphology and taxonomy. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and Southern analysis of the five C-1027 producers reveal that their C-1027 biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) are all located on giant plasmids of varying sizes. The high nucleotide sequence similarity among the five C-1027 BGCs implies that they most likely have evolved from a common ancestor.	0
Title: Benastatins A and B, new inhibitors of glutathione S-transferase, produced by Streptomyces sp. MI384-DF12. II. Structure determination of benastatins A and B Abstract: Benastatins A and B, new inhibitors of glutathione S-transferase, have been isolated from the culture broth of Streptomyces sp. MI384-DF12. By X-ray crystallography, benastatin A was determined to be 8,13-dihydro-1,7,9,11-tetrahydroxy-13-dimethyl-8-oxo-3-pentyl- benzo[a]naphthacene-2-carboxylic acid. The structure of benastatin B was elucidated by NMR studies.	1
Title: The Arabidopsis Kinome: phylogeny and evolutionary insights into functional diversification Abstract: Background:                       Protein kinases constitute a particularly large protein family in Arabidopsis with important functions in cellular signal transduction networks. At the same time Arabidopsis is a model plant with high frequencies of gene duplications. Here, we have conducted a systematic analysis of the Arabidopsis kinase complement, the kinome, with particular focus on gene duplication events. We matched Arabidopsis proteins to a Hidden-Markov Model of eukaryotic kinases and computed a phylogeny of 942 Arabidopsis protein kinase domains and mapped their origin by gene duplication.                  Results:                       The phylogeny showed two major clades of receptor kinases and soluble kinases, each of which was divided into functional subclades. Based on this phylogeny, association of yet uncharacterized kinases to families was possible which extended functional annotation of unknowns. Classification of gene duplications within these protein kinases revealed that representatives of cytosolic subfamilies showed a tendency to maintain segmentally duplicated genes, while some subfamilies of the receptor kinases were enriched for tandem duplicates. Although functional diversification is observed throughout most subfamilies, some instances of functional conservation among genes transposed from the same ancestor were observed. In general, a significant enrichment of essential genes was found among genes encoding for protein kinases.                  Conclusions:                       The inferred phylogeny allowed classification and annotation of yet uncharacterized kinases. The prediction and analysis of syntenic blocks and duplication events within gene families of interest can be used to link functional biology to insights from an evolutionary viewpoint. The approach undertaken here can be applied to any gene family in any organism with an annotated genome.	0
Title: Cloning, expression, and regulation of the Pseudomonas cepacia protocatechuate 3,4-dioxygenase genes Abstract: The genes for the alpha and beta subunits of the enzyme protocatechuate 3,4-dioxygenase (EC 1.13.11.3) were cloned from the Pseudomonas cepacia DBO1 chromosome on a 9.5-kilobase-pair PstI fragment into the broad-host-range cloning vector pRO2317. The resultant clone was able to complement protocatechuate 3,4-dioxugenase mutations in P. cepacia, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Pseudomonas putida. Expression studies showed that the genes were constitutively expressed and subject to catabolite repression in the heterologous host. Since the cloned genes exhibited normal induction patterns when present in P. cepacia DBO1, it was concluded that induction was subject to negative control. Regulatory studies with P. cepacia wild-type and mutant strains showed that protocatechuate 3,4-dioxygenase is induced either by protocatechuate or by beta-carboxymuconate. Further studies of P. cepacia DBO1 showed that p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase (EC 1.14.13.2), the preceding enzyme in the pathway, is induced by p-hydroxybenzoate and that beta-carboxymuconate lactonizing enzyme, which catalyzes the reaction following protocatechuate 3,4-dioxygenase, is induced by both p-hydroxybenzoate and beta-ketoadipate.	0
Title: Dissecting fragment-based lead discovery at the von Hippel-Lindau protein:hypoxia inducible factor 1α protein-protein interface Abstract: Fragment screening is widely used to identify attractive starting points for drug design. However, its potential and limitations to assess the tractability of often challenging protein:protein interfaces have been underexplored. Here, we address this question by means of a systematic deconstruction of lead-like inhibitors of the pVHL:HIF-1α interaction into their component fragments. Using biophysical techniques commonly employed for screening, we could only detect binding of fragments that violate the Rule of Three, are more complex than those typically screened against classical druggable targets, and occupy two adjacent binding subsites at the interface rather than just one. Analyses based on ligand and group lipophilicity efficiency of anchored fragments were applied to dissect the individual subsites and probe for binding hot spots. The implications of our findings for targeting protein interfaces by fragment-based approaches are discussed.	0
Title: Target-selected gene inactivation in Caenorhabditis elegans by using a frozen transposon insertion mutant bank Abstract: To understand how genotype determines the phenotype of the animal Caenorhabditis elegans, one ideally needs to know the complete sequence of the genome and the contribution of genes to phenotype, which requires an efficient strategy for reverse genetics. We here report that the Tc1 transposon induces frequent deletions of flanking DNA, apparently resulting from Tc1 excision followed by imprecise DNA repair. We use this to inactivate genes in two steps. (i) We established a frozen library of 5000 nematode lines mutagenized by Tc1 insertion, from which insertion mutants of genes of interest can be recovered. Their address within the library is determined by PCR. (ii) Animals are then screened, again by PCR, to detect derivatives in which Tc1 and 1000-2000 base pairs of flanking DNA are deleted, and thus a gene of interest is inactivated. We have thus far isolated Tc1 insertions in 16 different genes and obtained deletion derivatives of 6 of those.	0
Title: A new antibiotic, cypemycin. Taxonomy, fermentation, isolation and biological characteristics Abstract: A new peptide antibiotic, cypemycin, with a molecular weight of 2,097 (M+H), was isolated from the culture broth of Streptomyces sp. OH-4156. The antibiotic possesses cytocidal activity against P388 leukemia cells in vitro at a concentration of 1.3 microgram/ml (IC50 values), and the antibiotic showed antimicrobial activities against Micrococcus luteus (MIC, 0.2 microgram/ml).	1
Title: Cloning and characterization of a polyketide synthase gene cluster involved in biosynthesis of a proposed angucycline-like polyketide auricin in Streptomyces aureofaciens CCM 3239 Abstract: A new polyketide gene cluster, aur1, was identified in Streptomyces aureofaciens CCM3239 by using genes for the spore-pigment polyketide synthase of the Streptomyces coelicolor whiE operon as a probe. Sequence analysis of three overlapping DNA fragments (encompassing 15,100 bp) revealed 15 open reading frames, the majority of which showed high similarity to the previously characterized type II polyketide synthase genes. The highest similarity was to three Streptomyces polyketide gene clusters involved in biosynthesis of angucycline antibiotics, jadomycin, urdamycin and landomycin. The proposed S. aureofaciens ketosynthase (Aur1D) was phylogenetically more related to all known ketosynthases for polyketide antibiotics in Streptomyces than to spore-pigment ketosynthases. Interestingly, the aur1 gene cluster contained a gene encoding a proposed malonyl-CoA:ACP transacylase that has not been identified in any of the previously characterized type II polyketide synthase cluster. Transcriptional analysis of aur1 revealed a single promoter upstream the first open reading frame (the aur1A gene) that was active in all stages of differentiation with increased activity at the time of aerial mycelium formation. The aur1 gene cluster was disrupted by a homologous recombination, replacing the three genes (aur1B,C,D) including ketosynthase, with antibiotic resistance marker gene in S. aureofaciens chromosome. Disruption did not affect growth and differentiation; disrupted strain produced spores with wild-type gray-pink pigmentation. The biochromatographic analysis of the culture extracts from S. aureofaciens wild-type and aur1-disrupted strains revealed an antibacterial compound that was missing in the mutant. The results indicated a role of the S. aureofaciens aur1 gene cluster in biosynthesis of a polyketide secondary metabolite (which we named auricin), and not in the spore pigment biosynthesis.	1
Title: Mutation of a gene encoding a putative glycoprotease leads to reduced salt tolerance, altered pigmentation, and cyanophycin accumulation in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. strain PCC 6803 Abstract: The salt-sensitive mutant 549 of the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. strain PCC 6803 was genetically and physiologically characterized. The mutated site and corresponding wild-type site were cloned and partially sequenced. The genetic analysis revealed that during the mutation about 1.8 kb was deleted from the chromosome of mutant 549. This deletion affected four open reading frames: a gcp gene homolog, the psaFJ genes, and an unknown gene. After construction of mutants with single mutations, only the gcp mutant showed a reduction in salt tolerance comparable to that of the initial mutant, indicating that the deletion of this gene was responsible for the salt sensitivity and that the other genes were of minor importance. Besides the reduced salt tolerance, a remarkable change in pigmentation was observed that became more pronounced in salt-stressed cells. The phycobilipigment content decreased, and that of carotenoids increased. Investigations of changes in the ultrastructure revealed an increase in the amount of characteristic inclusion bodies containing the high-molecular-weight nitrogen storage polymer cyanophycin (polyaspartate and arginine). The salt-induced accumulation of cyanophycin was confirmed by chemical estimations. The putative glycoprotease encoded by the gcp gene might be responsible for the degradation of cyanophycin in Synechocystis. Mutation of this gene leads to nitrogen starvation of the cells, accompanied by characteristic changes in pigmentation, ultrastructure, and salt tolerance level.	0
Title: A FRET-Based Near-Infrared Fluorescent Probe for Ratiometric Detection of Cysteine in Mitochondria Abstract: We report a near-infrared fluorescent probe A for the ratiometric detection of cysteine based on FRET from a coumarin donor to a near-infrared rhodamine acceptor. Upon addition of cysteine, the coumarin fluorescence increased dramatically up to 18-fold and the fluorescence of the rhodamine acceptor decreased moderately by 45 % under excitation of the coumarin unit. Probe A has been used to detect cysteine concentration changes in live cells ratiometrically and to visualize fluctuations in cysteine concentrations induced by oxidation stress through treatment with hydrogen peroxide or lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Finally, probe A was successfully applied for the in vivo imaging of Drosophila melanogaster larvae to measure cysteine concentration changes.	0
Title: Functions required for extracellular quinolone signaling by Pseudomonas aeruginosa Abstract: A set of 30 mutants exhibiting reduced production of the phenazine poison pyocyanin were isolated following transposon mutagenesis of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1. The mutants could be subdivided into those with defects in the primary phenazine biosynthetic pathway and those with more pleiotropic defects. The largest set of pleiotropic mutations blocked the production of the extracellular Pseudomonas quinolone signal (PQS), a molecule required for the synthesis of secondary metabolites and extracellular enzymes. Most of these pqs mutations affected genes which appear to encode PQS biosynthetic functions, although a transcriptional regulator and an apparent response effector were also represented. Two of the genes required for PQS synthesis (phnA and phnB) had previously been assumed to encode phenazine biosynthetic functions. The transcription of one of the genes required for PQS synthesis (PA2587/pqsH) was regulated by the LasI/R quorum-sensing system, thereby linking quorum sensing and PQS regulation. Others of the pleiotropic phenazine-minus mutations appear to inactivate novel components of the quorum-sensing regulatory network, including one regulator (np20) previously shown to be required for virulence in neutropenic mice.	1
Title: Characterization of anti-BCG benz[α]anthraquinones and new siderophores from a Xinjiang desert-isolated rare actinomycete Nocardia sp. XJ31 Abstract: The current global demand for novel anti-TB drugs has drawn urgent attention on the discovery of natural product compounds with anti-TB activity. Lots of efforts have emphasized on environmental samples from unexplored or underexplored natural habits and identified numerous rare actinomycete taxa producing structurally diverse bioactive natural products. Herein, we report a survey of the rare actinobacteria diversity in Xinjiang region together with the discovery of anti-TB active natural products from these strains. We have collected 17 soil samples at different sites with different environmental conditions, from which 39 rare actinobacteria were identified by using a selective isolation strategy with 5 media variations. Among those isolated strains, XJ31 was identified as a new Nocardia sp. based on 16S rRNA gene analysis. Through one strain-many compounds (OSMAC) strategy combined with anti-Bacillus Calmette-Guérin bioassay-guided isolation, two groups of compounds were identified. They were twelve siderophores (nocardimicins, 1-12) and two anthraquinones (brasiliquinones, 13 and 14) and ten of them were identified as new compounds. The structures of the purified compounds were elucidated using HR-ESI-MS, 1D NMR, and 2D NMR techniques. The anti-TB bioassays revealed that the two benz[α]anthraquinones have potent activity against BCG (MICs = 25 μM), which can be used as a promising start point for further anti-TB drug development. KEY POINTS: • Ten new natural products were identified from Nocardia sp. XJ31. • Brasiliquinones 13 and 14 showed moderate anti-BCG activity.	0
Title: Tn21-specific structures in gram-negative bacteria from clinical isolates Abstract: A total of 807 gram-negative clinical isolates were treated with five different probes: intragenic segments for the transposase gene tnpA; the resolvase gene tnpR; the modulator of the resolvase, tnpM; the integraselike factor gene tnpI; and a 20-mer oligonucleotide for the recombinational site of action for the integrase. A total of 8% of the isolates hybridized with all five Tn21-related probes, and another 11% represented transposons in which one or more of the tested genes were missing. This 11% included groups whose descriptions have been published as well as groups that have not yet been described. The not-yet-described groups include various deletion products and some precursor structures, as is predicted for the evolution of Tn21-like transposons. The integration system appears to be coupled with Tn21-like structures and yet independent from these structures, implying an independent evolution of this system from Tn21-like transposons. The structures were found with similar incidence levels in all species tested except Pseudomonas aeruginosa, for which a novel separate family of class II transposons has been described before.	0
Title: Biosynthesis of the neurotoxin domoic acid in a bloom-forming diatom Abstract: Oceanic harmful algal blooms of Pseudo-nitzschia diatoms produce the potent mammalian neurotoxin domoic acid (DA). Despite decades of research, the molecular basis for its biosynthesis is not known. By using growth conditions known to induce DA production in Pseudo-nitzschia multiseries, we implemented transcriptome sequencing in order to identify DA biosynthesis genes that colocalize in a genomic four-gene cluster. We biochemically investigated the recombinant DA biosynthetic enzymes and linked their mechanisms to the construction of DA's diagnostic pyrrolidine skeleton, establishing a model for DA biosynthesis. Knowledge of the genetic basis for toxin production provides an orthogonal approach to bloom monitoring and enables study of environmental factors that drive oceanic DA production.	1
Title: Auxin-induced changes in the patterns of protein synthesis in soybean hypocotyl Abstract: The patterns of protein synthesis in elongating and mature (basal) sections of soybean hypocotyl were examined after incubation in a medium containing auxin (auxin-treated) or a medium lacking auxin (untreated). The hypocotyl sections (1.2 cm) were labeled with [(35)S]methionine, and polypeptide patterns were analyzed by one- and two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Auxin treatment altered the pattern of protein synthesis in both elongating and basal soybean hypocotyl sections. Excision of terminal segments from incubated sections was required to clearly observe auxin-induced changes in the synthesis of polypeptides. Polypeptides synthesized in terminal segments, possibly in response to wounding, can mask subtle changes in the spectrum of polypeptides synthesized in response to auxin. Cytokinin treatment caused a decrease in [(35)S]methionine incorporation into polypeptides and altered the pattern of protein synthesis in untreated and auxin-treated elongating hypocotyl sections.	0
Title: Precise Formation of a Hollow Carbon Nitride Structure with a Janus Surface To Promote Water Splitting by Photoredox Catalysis Abstract: The precise modification of redox species on the inner and outer surfaces of hollow nanostructures is relevant in catalysis, surface science, and nanotechnology, but has proven difficult to achieve. Herein, we develop a facile approach to specifically fabricate Pt and Co3 O4 nanoparticles (NPs) onto the interior and exterior surface of hollow carbon nitride spheres (HCNS), respectively, to promote the surface redox functions of the polymer semiconductors. The photocatalytic water splitting activities of HCNS with spatially separated oxidation and reduction centers at their nanodomains were enhanced. The origin of the enhanced activity was attributed to the spatially separated reactive sites for the evolution of H2 and O2 and also to the unidirectional migration of the electron and hole on the Janus surfaces, thereby preventing the unwanted reverse reaction of water splitting and decreasing charge recombination.	0
Title: Isolation and sequence analysis of polyketide synthase genes from the daunomycin-producing Streptomyces sp. strain C5 Abstract: A contiguous region of about 30 kbp of DNA putatively encoding reactions in daunomycin biosynthesis was isolated from Streptomyces sp. strain C5 DNA. The DNA sequence of an 8.1-kbp EcoRI fragment, which hybridized with actI polyketide synthase (PKS) and actIII polyketide reductase (PKR) gene probes, was determined, revealing seven complete open reading frames (ORFs), two in one cluster and five in a divergently transcribed cluster. The former two genes are likely to encode PKR and a bifunctional cyclase/dehydrase. The five latter genes encode: (i) a homolog of TcmH, an oxygenase of the tetracenomycin biosynthesis pathway; (ii) a PKS Orf1 homolog; (iii) a PKS Orf2 homolog (chain length factor); (iv) a product having moderate sequence identity with Escherichia coli beta-ketoacyl acyl carrier protein synthase III but lacking the conserved active site; and (v) a protein highly similar to several acyltransferases. The DNA within the 8.1-kbp EcoRI fragment restored daunomycin production to two dauA non-daunomycin-producing mutants of Streptomyces sp. strain C5 and restored wild-type antibiotic production to Streptomyces coelicolor B40 (act VII; nonfunctional cyclase/dehydrase), and to S. coelicolor B41 (actIII) and Streptomyces galilaeus ATCC 31671, strains defective in PKR activity.	1
Title: Conformation and lipid binding of a C-terminal (198-243) peptide of human apolipoprotein A-I Abstract: Human apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) is the principle apolipoprotein of high-density lipoproteins that are critically involved in reverse cholesterol transport. The intrinsically flexibility of apoA-I has hindered studies of the structural and functional details of the protein. Our strategy is to study peptide models representing different regions of apoA-I. Our previous report on [1-44]apoA-I demonstrated that this N-terminal region is unstructured and folds into approximately 60% alpha-helix with a moderate lipid binding affinity. We now present details of the conformation and lipid interaction of a C-terminal 46-residue peptide, [198-243]apoA-I, encompassing putative helix repeats 10 and 9 and the second half of repeat 8 from the C-terminus of apoA-I. Far-ultraviolet circular dichroism spectra show that [198-243]apoA-I is also unfolded in aqueous solution. However, self-association induces approximately 50% alpha-helix in the peptide. The self-associated peptide exists mainly as a tetramer, as determined by native electrophoresis, cross-linking with glutaraldehyde, and unfolding data from circular dichroism (CD) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). In the presence of a number of lipid-mimicking detergents, above their CMC, approximately 60% alpha-helix was induced in the peptide. In contrast, SDS, an anionic lipid-mimicking detergent, induced helical folding in the peptide at a concentration of approximately 0.003% (approximately 100 microM), approximately 70-fold below its typical CMC (0.17-0.23% or 6-8 mM). Both monomeric and tetrameric peptide can solubilize dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC) liposomes and fold into approximately 60% alpha-helix. Fractionation by density gradient ultracentrifugation and visualization by negative staining electromicroscopy demonstrated that the peptide binds to DMPC with a high affinity to form at least two sizes of relatively homogeneous discoidal HDL-like particles depending on the initial lipid:peptide ratio. The characteristics (lipid:peptide weight ratio, diameter, and density) of both complexes are similar to those of plasma A-I/DMPC complexes formed under similar conditions: small discoidal complexes (approximately 3:1 weight ratio, approximately 110 A, and approximately 1.10 g/cm3) formed at an initial 1:1 weight ratio and larger discoidal complexes (approximately 4.6:1 weight ratio, approximately 165 A, and approximately 1.085 g/cm3) formed at initial 4:1 weight ratio. The cross-linking data for the peptide on the complexes of two sizes is consistent with the calculated peptide numbers per particle. Compared to the approximately 100 A disk-like complex formed by the N-terminal peptide in which helical structure was insufficient to cover the disk edge by a single belt, the compositions of these two types of complexes formed by the C-terminal peptide are more consistent with a "double belt" model, similar to that proposed for full-length apoA-I. Thus, our data provide direct evidence that this C-terminal region of apoA-I is responsible for the self-association of apoA-I, and this C-terminal peptide model can mimic the interaction with the phospholipid of plasma apoA-I to form two sizes of homogeneous discoidal complexes and thus may be responsible for apoA-I function in the formation and maintenance of HDL subspecies in plasma.	0
Title: Enhancement of expression and apparent secretion of Erwinia chrysanthemi endoglucanase (encoded by celZ) in Escherichia coli B Abstract: Escherichia coli B has been engineered as a biocatalyst for the conversion of lignocellulose into ethanol. Previous research has demonstrated that derivatives of E. coli B can produce high levels of Erwinia chrysanthemi endoglucanase (encoded by celZ) as a periplasmic product and that this enzyme can function with commercial fungal cellulase to increase ethanol production. In this study, we have demonstrated two methods that improve celZ expression in E. coli B. Initially, with a low-copy-number vector, two E. coli glycolytic gene promoters (gap and eno) were tested and found to be less effective than the original celZ promoter. By screening 18,000 random fragments of Zymomonas mobilis DNA, a surrogate promoter was identified which increased celZ expression up to sixfold. With this promoter, large polar inclusion bodies were clearly evident in the periplasmic space. Sequencing revealed that the most active surrogate promoter is derived from five Sau3A1 fragments, one of which was previously sequenced in Z. mobilis. Visual inspection indicated that this DNA fragment contains at least five putative promoter regions, two of which were confirmed by primer extension analysis. Addition of the out genes from E. chrysanthemi EC16 caused a further increase in the production of active enzyme and facilitated secretion or release of over half of the activity into the extracellular environment. With the most active construct, of a total of 13,000 IU of active enzyme per liter of culture, 7,800 IU was in the supernatant. The total active endoglucanase was estimated to represent 4 to 6% of cellular protein.	0
Title: Assembly of high-nuclearity Sn26 , Sn34 -oxo clusters: solvent strategies and inorganic Sn incorporation Abstract: A series of unprecedented high-nuclearity tin-oxo nanoclusters (up to Sn34 ) with structural diversity have been obtained. The characteristics of the applied solvents had great influence on the assembly of these Sn-O clusters. Pure alcohol environments only gave rise to small clusters of Sn6 , whilst the introduction of water significantly increased the nuclearity to Sn26 , which greatly exceeds those of the known tin-oxo clusters (≤14); the use of aprotic CH3CN finally produced the largest Sn34 to date. Apart from the nuclearity breakthrough, the obtained tin-oxo clusters also present new structural types that are not found in previous reports, including a layered nanorod-like structure of Sn26 and the cage-dimer structure of Sn34 . The layered Sn26 clusters represent good molecular models for SnO2 materials. Moreover, an electrode derived from TOC-17 with a {Sn26 } core shows better electrocatalytic CO2 reduction activity than that from TOC-18 with Sn34 . This work not only provides an efficient methodology for the rational assembly of high-nuclearity Sn-O clusters, but also extends their potential applications in energy conversion.	0
Title: Structure and Biosynthesis of Isatropolones, Bioactive Amine-Scavenging Fluorescent Natural Products from Streptomyces Gö66 Abstract: The natural products isatropolone A-C (1-3) were reisolated from Streptomyces Gö66, with 1 and 3 showing potent activity against Leishmania donovani. They contain a rare tropolone ring derived from a type II polyketide biosynthesis pathway. Their biosynthesis was elucidated by labeling experiments, analysis of the biosynthesis gene cluster, its partial heterologous expression, and structural characterization of various intermediates. Owing to their 1,5-diketone moiety, they can react with ammonia, amines, lysine, and lysine-containing peptides and proteins, which results in the formation of a covalent bond and subsequent pyridine ring formation. Their fluorescence properties change upon amine binding, enabling the simple visualization of reacted amines including proteins.	1
Title: An acyl-CoA dehydrogenase is involved in the formation of the Delta cis3 double bond in the acyl residue of the lipopeptide antibiotic friulimicin in Actinoplanes friuliensis Abstract: The lipopeptide antibiotic friulimicin, produced by Actinoplanes friuliensis, is an effective drug against Gram-positive bacteria, such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus aureus strains. Friulimicin consists of a cyclic peptide core of ten amino acids and an acyl residue linked to an exocyclic amino acid. The acyl residue is essential for antibiotic activity, varies in length from C13 to C15, and carries a characteristic double bond at position Delta cis3. Sequencing of a DNA fragment adjacent to a previously described fragment encoding some of the friulimicin biosynthetic genes revealed several genes whose gene products resemble enzymes of lipid metabolism. One of these genes, lipB, encodes an acyl-CoA dehydrogenase homologue. To elucidate the function of the LipB protein, a lipB insertion mutant was generated and the friulimicin derivative (FR242) produced by the mutant was purified. FR242 had antibiotic activity lower than friulimicin in a bioassay. Gas chromatography showed that the acyl residue of wild-type friulimicin contains a double bond, whereas a saturated bond was present in FR242. These results were confirmed by the heterologous expression of lipB in Streptomyces lividans T7, which led to the production of unsaturated fatty acids not found in the S. lividans T7 parent strain. These results indicate that the acyl-CoA dehydrogenase LipB is involved in the introduction of the unusual Delta cis3 double bond into the acyl residue of friulimicin.	1
Title: Natural products from environmental DNA hosted in Ralstonia metallidurans Abstract: Metagenomic studies designed to access new small molecules from the heterologous expression of environmental DNA have focused on the use of two model systems, Escherichia coli and Streptomyces spp., as heterologous hosts. Accessing the biosynthetic potential of DNA extracted from the bacteria present in environmental samples will require the development of a more diverse collection of model bacterial hosts that can be used for screening environmental DNA libraries. In this study the bacterium Ralstonia metallidurans was explored as a heterologous host. Here we report the isolation and characterization of both novel and known metabolites from pigmented and antibacterially active clones found in R. metallidurans based environmental DNA libraries. The clones found in this study do not confer the production of clone-specific metabolites to E. coli, validating R. metallidurans as an orthogonal expression host that can be used to expand the number of metabolites found in future metagenomic discovery efforts.	1
Title: Conformational Behaviour of Azasugars Based on Mannuronic Acid Abstract: A set of mannuronic-acid-based iminosugars, consisting of the C-5-carboxylic acid, methyl ester and amide analogues of 1deoxymannorjirimicin (DMJ), was synthesised and their pH-dependent conformational behaviour was studied. Under acidic conditions the methyl ester and the carboxylic acid adopted an "inverted" 1 C4 chair conformation as opposed to the "normal" 4 C1 chair at basic pH. This conformational change is explained in terms of the stereoelectronic effects of the ring substituents and it parallels the behaviour of the mannuronic acid ester oxocarbenium ion. Because of this solution-phase behaviour, the mannuronic acid ester azasugar was examined as an inhibitor for a Caulobacter GH47 mannosidase that hydrolyses its substrates by way of a reaction itinerary that proceeds through a 3 H4 transition state. No binding was observed for the mannuronic acid ester azasugar, but sub-atomic resolution data were obtained for the DMJ⋅CkGH47 complex, showing two conformations-3 S1 and 1 C4 -for the DMJ inhibitor.	0
Title: Characterization of a Legionella pneumophila relA insertion mutant and toles of RelA and RpoS in virulence gene expression Abstract: To investigate the involvement of RelA in the regulation of Legionella pneumophila virulence, a deletion substitution was constructed in the relA gene. The relA knockout resulted in an undetectable level of ppGpp in the cells during the stationary phase, but the original level was restored when the relA gene product was supplied on a plasmid. The effect of the relA mutation was examined with two systems that are known to be expressed during the stationary phase in L. pneumophila. Pigment production was found to be dependent on the relA gene product, and only one-half as much pigment was produced by the relA mutant as by the wild-type strain. Flagellum gene expression was also found to be dependent on the relA gene product, as determined with a flaA::lacZ fusion. However, the relA gene product was found to be dispensable for intracellular growth both in HL-60-derived human macrophages and in the protozoan host Acanthamoeba castellanii. To determine the involvement of the relA gene product in expression of L. pneumophila genes required for intracellular growth (icm/dot genes), nine icm::lacZ fusions were constructed, and expression of these fusions in the wild-type strain was compared with their expression in relA mutant strains. Expression of only one of the icm::lacZ fusions was moderately reduced in the relA mutant strain. Expression of the nine icm::lacZ fusions was also examined in a strain containing an insertion in the gene that codes for the stationary-phase sigma factor RpoS, and similar results were obtained. We concluded that RelA is dispensable for intracellular growth of L. pneumophila in the two hosts examined and that both RelA and RpoS play minor roles in L. pneumophila icm/dot gene expression.	0
Title: Identification and molecular genetic analysis of the cichorine gene cluster in Aspergillus nidulans Abstract: We recently demonstrated that the phytotoxin cichorine is produced by Aspergillus nidulans. Through a set of targeted deletions, we have found a cluster of seven genes that are required for its biosynthesis. Two of the deletions yielded molecules that give information about the biosynthesis of this metabolite.	1
Title: Overexpression of a novel member of the mitochondrial carrier family rescues defects in both DNA and RNA metabolism in yeast mitochondria Abstract: The PIF1 and MRS2 gene products have previously been shown to be essential for mitochondrial DNA maintenance at elevated temperatures and mitochondrial group II intron splicing, respectively, in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. A multicopy suppressor capable of rescuing the respiratory deficient phenotype associated with null alleles of either gene has been isolated. This suppressor is a nuclear gene that was called RIM2/MRS12. The RIM2/MRS12 gene encodes a predicted protein of 377 amino acids that is essential for mitochondrial DNA metabolism and proper cell growth. Inactivation of this gene causes the total loss of mitochondrial DNA and, compared to wild-type rhoo controls, a slow-growth phenotype on media containing glucose. Analysis of the RIM2/MRS12 protein sequence suggests that RIM2/MRS12 encodes a novel member of the mitochondrial carrier family. In particular, a typical triplicate structure, where each repeat consists of two putative transmembrane segments separated by a hydrophilic loop, can be deduced from amino acid sequence comparisons and the hydropathy profile of RIM2/MRS12. Antibodies directed against the aminoterminus of RIM2/MRS12 detect this protein in mitochondria. The function of the RIM2/MRS12 protein and the substrates it might transport are discussed.	0
Title: Heterologous expression of the biosynthetic gene clusters of coumermycin A(1), clorobiocin and caprazamycins in genetically modified Streptomyces coelicolor strains Abstract: The biosynthetic gene clusters of the aminocoumarin antibiotics clorobiocin and coumermycin A(1) and of the liponucleoside antibiotic caprazamycin were stably integrated into the genomes of different host strains derived from Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2). For the heterologous expression of clorobiocin derivatives in a chemically defined medium, inclusion of 0.6% of the siloxylated ethylene oxide/propylene oxide copolymer Q2-5247 into the growth medium proved to result in a 4.8-fold increase of productivity. Presumably, this copolymer acts as an oxygen carrier. The additional inclusion of cobalt chloride (0.2-2 mg l(-1)) dramatically increased the percentage of the desired compound clorobiocin within the total produced clorobiocin derivatives. This is very likely due to a stimulation of a cobalamin-dependent methylation reaction catalyzed by the enzyme CloN6 of clorobiocin biosynthesis. All three investigated host strains (S. coelicolor M512, M1146 and M1154) gave similar production rates of total clorobiocin derivatives (on average, 158 mg l(-1) in the presence of 0.6% Q2-5247 and 0.2 mg l(-1) CoCl(2)). In contrast, heterologous production of caprazamycin derivatives was optimal in strain M1154 (amounts of 152 mg l(-1) on average).	1
Title: Isotopically Labeled Clickable Glutathione to Quantify Protein S-Glutathionylation Abstract: Protein S-glutathionylation is one of the important cysteine oxidation events that regulate various redox-mediated biological processes. Despite several existing methods, there are few proteomic approaches to identify and quantify specific cysteine residues susceptible to S-glutathionylation. We previously developed a clickable glutathione approach that labels intracellular glutathione with azido-Ala by using a mutant form of glutathione synthetase. In this study, we developed a quantification strategy with clickable glutathione by using isotopically labeled heavy and light derivatives of azido-Ala, which provides the relative quantification of glutathionylated peptides in mass spectrometry-based proteomic analysis. We applied isotopically labeled clickable glutathione to HL-1 cardiomyocytes, quantifying relative levels of 1398 glutathionylated peptides upon addition of hydrogen peroxide. Importantly, we highlight elevated levels of glutathionylation on sarcomere-associated muscle proteins while validating glutathionylation of two structural proteins, α-actinin and desmin. Our report provides a chemical proteomic strategy to quantify specific glutathionylated cysteines.	0
Title: 4-O-acetylation and 3-O-acetylation of trichothecenes by trichothecene 15-O-acetyltransferase encoded by Fusarium Tri3 Abstract: In the biosynthesis of Fusarium trichothecenes, the C-3 hydroxyl group of isotrichodermol must be acetylated by TRI101 for subsequent pathway genes to function. Despite the importance of this 3-O-acetylation step in biosynthesis, Tri101 is both physically and evolutionarily unrelated to other Tri genes in the trichothecene gene cluster. To gain insight into the evolutionary history of the cluster, we purified recombinant TRI3 (rTRI3), one of the two cluster gene-encoded trichothecene O-acetyltransferases, and examined to determine whether this 15-O-acetyltransferase can add an acetyl to the C-3 hydroxyl group of isotrichodermol. When a high concentration of rTRI3 was used in the assay (final concentration, 50 microM), we observed 3-O-acetylation activity against isotrichodermol that was more than 10(5) times less efficient than the known 15-O-acetylation activity against 15-deacetylcalonectrin. The rTRI3 protein also exhibited 4-O-acetylation activity when nivalenol was used as a substrate; in addition to 15-acetylnivalenol, di-acetylated derivatives, 4,15-diacetylnivalenol, and, to a lesser extent, 3,15-diacetylnivalenol, were also detected at high enzyme concentrations. The significance of the trace trichothecene 3-O-acetyltransferase activity detected in rTRI3 is discussed in relation to the evolution of the trichothecene gene cluster.	1
Title: Structure and Biosynthesis of Myxofacyclines: Unique Myxobacterial Polyketides Featuring Varing and Rare Heterocycles[] * Abstract: A metabolome-guided screening approach in the novel myxobacterium Corallococcus sp. MCy9072 resulted in the isolation of the unprecedented natural product myxofacycline A, which features a rare isoxazole substructure. Identification and genomic investigation of additional producers alongside targeted gene inactivation experiments and heterologous expression of the corresponding biosynthetic gene cluster in the host Myxococcus xanthus DK1622 confirmed a noncanonical megaenzyme complex as the biosynthetic origin of myxofacycline A. Induced expression of the respective genes led to significantly increased production titers enabling the identification of six further members of the myxofacycline natural product family. Whereas myxofacyclines A-D display an isoxazole substructure, intriguingly myxofacyclines E and F were found to contain 4-pyrimidinole, a heterocycle unprecedented in natural products. Lastly, myxofacycline G features another rare 1,2-dihydropyrol-3-one moiety. In addition to a full structure elucidation, we report the underlying biosynthetic machinery and present a rationale for the formation of all myxofacyclines. Unexpectedly, an extraordinary polyketide synthase-nonribosomal peptide synthetase hybrid was found to produce all three types of heterocycle in these natural products.	1
Title: Biosynthesis of the ansamycin antibiotic rifamycin: deductions from the molecular analysis of the rif biosynthetic gene cluster of Amycolatopsis mediterranei S699 Abstract: Background:                       The ansamycin class of antibiotics are produced by various Actinomycetes. Their carbon framework arises from the polyketide pathway via a polyketide synthase (PKS) that uses an unusual starter unit. Rifamycin (rif), produced by Amycolatopsis mediterranei, is the archetype ansamycin and it is medically important. Although its basic precursors (3-amino-5-hydroxy benzoic acid AHBA, and acetic and propionic acids) had been established, and several biosynthetic intermediates had been identified, very little was known about the origin of AHBA nor had the PKS and the various genes and enzymes that modify the initial intermediate been characterized.                  Results:                       A set of 34 genes clustered around the rifK gene encoding AHBA synthase were defined by sequencing all but 5 kilobases (kb) of a 95 kb contiguous region of DNA from A. mediterranei. The involvement of some of the genes in the biosynthesis of rifamycin B was examined. At least five genes were shown to be essential for the synthesis of AHBA, five genes were determined to encode the modular type I PKS that uses AHBA as the starter unit, and 20 or more genes appear to govern modification of the polyketide-derived framework, and rifamycin resistance and export. Putative regulatory genes were also identified. Disruption of the PKS genes at the end of rifA abolished rifamycin B production and resulted in the formation of P8/1-OG, a known shunt product of rifamycin biosynthesis, whereas disruption of the orf6 and orf9 genes, which may encode deoxysugar biosynthesis enzymes, had no apparent effect.                  Conclusions:                       Rifamycin production in A. mediterranei is governed by a single gene cluster consisting of structural, resistance and export, and regulatory genes. The genes characterized here could be modified to produce novel forms of the rifamycins that may be effective against rifamycin-resistant microorganisms.	1
Title: Isolation and characterization of endophytic colonizing bacteria from agronomic crops and prairie plants Abstract: Endophytic bacteria reside within plant hosts without causing disease symptoms. In this study, 853 endophytic strains were isolated from aerial tissues of four agronomic crop species and 27 prairie plant species. We determined several phenotypic properties and found approximately equal numbers of gram-negative and gram-positive isolates. In a greenhouse study, 28 of 86 prairie plant endophytes were found to colonize their original hosts at 42 days postinoculation at levels of 3.5 to 7.7 log(10) CFU/g (fresh weight). More comprehensive colonization studies were conducted with 373 corn and sorghum endophytes. In growth room studies, none of the isolates displayed pathogenicity, and 69 of the strains were recovered from corn or sorghum seedlings at levels of 8.3 log(10) CFU/plant or higher. Host range greenhouse studies demonstrated that 26 of 29 endophytes were recoverable from at least one host other than corn and sorghum at levels of up to 5.8 log(10) CFU/g (fresh weight). Long-range dent corn greenhouse studies and field trials with 17 wild-type strains and 14 antibiotic-resistant mutants demonstrated bacterial persistence at significant average colonization levels ranging between 3.4 and 6.1 log(10) CFU/g (fresh weight) up to 78 days postinoculation. Three prairie and three agronomic endophytes exhibiting the most promising levels of colonization and an ability to persist were identified as Cellulomonas, Clavibacter, Curtobacterium, and Microbacterium isolates by 16S rRNA gene sequence, fatty acid, and carbon source utilization analyses. This study defines for the first time the endophytic nature of Microbacterium testaceum. These microorganisms may be useful for biocontrol and other applications.	0
Title: Tumor initiators and promoters in the induction of Epstein-Barr virus Abstract: The effect of various tumor initiators and promoters on induction of persisting Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) in different lines of lymphoblastoid cells was analyzed. Neither five polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, amongst them potent tumor initiators (e.g., 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene), nor the potent (ultimate) liver carcinogen N-acetoxy-N-2-acetylamino-fluorene induced EBV. A series of compounds, representing three classes of tumor-promoting diterpene esters (e.g., 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate), efficiently induced EBV in persistently infected cells. The concentration required for maximal induction ranged between 0.5 and 100 nM. Some nonpromoting diterpenes (phorbol, 4alpha-phorbol-12,13-didecanoate, and ingenol) did not induce EBV. However, the nonpromoters, resiniferatoxin and 12-deoxyphorbol-13-decatrienoate, were effective, whereas anthralin, a tumor promoter, did not induce EBV. In three lines of EBV genome-carrying cells (Raji, NC-37, and RPMI 64-10) only abortive induction was noted, leading exclusively to synthesis of early antigen. In cells of lines with low spontaneous virus release (P3HR-1, B95-8, and QIMR-Wil), upon treatment with tetradecanoylphorbol acetate, approximately 20-40 times more viral DNA was recovered as compared to untreated controls. Viral DNA from tetradeca-noylphorbol acetate-induced cultures revealed the same restriction endonuclease cleavage pattern as viral DNA obtained from noninduced cells. Within 10 days after induction, release of infectious virus increased approximately by one order of magnitude. Prostaglandins, reported to be released after treatment with tumor promoters, were ineffective in virus induction under the conditions tested.	0
Title: Characterization of Methanobactin from Methylosinus sp. LW4 Abstract: Methanobactins (Mbns) are a growing family of ribosomally produced, post-translationally modified natural products. Characteristic nitrogen-containing heterocycles and neighboring thioamides allow these compounds to bind copper with high affinity. Genome mining has enabled the identification of Mbn operons in bacterial genomes and the prediction of diverse Mbn structures from operon content and precursor peptide sequence. Here we report the characterization of Mbn from Methylosinus (Ms.) species (sp.) LW4. The peptide backbone is distinct from all previously characterized Mbns, and the post-translational modifications correspond precisely to those predicted on the basis of the Ms. sp. LW4 Mbn operon. Thus, prediction based on genome analysis combined with isolation and structural characterization represents a phylogenetic approach to finding diverse Mbns and elucidating their biosynthetic pathways.	1
Title: The virulent Wolbachia strain wMelPop increases the frequency of apoptosis in the female germline cells of Drosophila melanogaster Abstract: Background:                       Wolbachia are bacterial endosymbionts of many arthropod species in which they manipulate reproductive functions. The distribution of these bacteria in the Drosophila ovarian cells at different stages of oogenesis has been amply described. The pathways along which Wolbachia influences Drosophila oogenesis have been, so far, little studied. It is known that Wolbachia are abundant in the somatic stem cell niche of the Drosophila germarium. A checkpoint, where programmed cell death, or apoptosis, can occur, is located in region 2a/2b of the germarium, which comprises niche cells. Here we address the question whether or not the presence of Wolbachia in germarium cells can affect the frequency of cyst apoptosis in the checkpoint.                  Results:                       Our current fluorescent microscopic observations showed that the wMel and wMelPop strains had different effects on female germline cells of D. melanogaster. The Wolbachia strain wMel did not affect the frequency of apoptosis in cells of the germarium. The presence of the Wolbachia strain wMelPop in the D. melanogasterw1118 ovaries increased the number of germaria where cells underwent apoptosis in the checkpoint. Based on the appearance in the electron microscope, there was no difference in morphological features of apoptotic cystocytes between Wolbachia-infected and uninfected flies. Bacteria with normal ultrastructure and large numbers of degenerating bacteria were found in the dying cyst cells.                  Conclusions:                       Our current study demonstrated that the Wolbachia strain wMelPop affects the egg chamber formation in the D. melanogaster ovaries. This led to an increase in the number of germaria containing apoptotic cells. It is suggested that Wolbachia can adversely interfere either with the cystocyte differentiation into the oocyte or with the division of somatic stem cells giving rise to follicle cells and, as a consequence, to improper ratio of germline cells to follicle cells and, ultimately, to apoptosis of cysts. There was no similar adverse effect in D. melanogaster Canton S infected with the Wolbachia strain wMel. This was taken to mean that the observed increase in frequency of apoptosis was not the general effect of Wolbachia on germline cells of D. melanogaster, it was rather induced by the virulent Wolbachia strain wMelPop.	0
Title: Biosynthesis of the cyclooligomer depsipeptide bassianolide, an insecticidal virulence factor of Beauveria bassiana Abstract: Beauveria bassiana is a facultative entomopathogen with an extremely broad host range that is used as a commercial biopesticide for the control of insects of agricultural, veterinary and medical significance. B. bassiana produces bassianolide, a cyclooligomer depsipeptide secondary metabolite. We have cloned the bbBsls gene of B. bassiana encoding a nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS). Targeted inactivation of the B. bassiana genomic copy of bbBsls abolished bassianolide production, but did not affect the biosynthesis of beauvericin, another cyclodepsipeptide produced by the strain. Comparative sequence analysis of the BbBSLS bassianolide synthetase revealed enzymatic domains for the iterative synthesis of an enzyme-bound dipeptidol monomer intermediate from d-2-hydroxyisovalerate and l-leucine. Further BbBSLS domains are predicted to catalyze the formation of the cyclic tetrameric ester bassianolide by recursive condensations of this monomer. Comparative infection assays against three selected insect hosts established bassianolide as a highly significant virulence factor of B. bassiana.	1
Title: Panclicins, novel pancreatic lipase inhibitors. II. Structural elucidation Abstract: Panclicins A-E are novel and potent pancreatic lipase inhibitors produced by Streptomyces sp. NR 0619. Their structures have been elucidated based on NMR and FAB-MS experiments. The relative configurations have also been determined by NMR experiments. The absolute stereochemistry has been determined by the chiral HPLC analysis of the hydrolysates of panclicins A and B and by modified Mosher's method on a derivative of panclicin A. They are structurally related to beta-lactone esterase inhibitors of microbial origin, lipstatin, valilactone, ebelactones and esterastin. Panclicins also contain a beta-lactone structure with two alkyl chains, one of which has an N-formylalanyloxy or N-formylglycyloxy substituent.	0
Title: Effective approaches to discover new microbial metabolites in a large strain library Abstract: Natural products have provided many molecules to treat and prevent illnesses in humans, animals and plants. While only a small fraction of the existing microbial diversity has been explored for bioactive metabolites, tens of thousands of molecules have been reported in the literature over the past 80 years. Thus, the main challenge in microbial metabolite screening is to avoid the re-discovery of known metabolites in a cost-effective manner. In this perspective, we report and discuss different approaches used in our laboratory over the past few years, ranging from bioactivity-based screening to looking for metabolic rarity in different datasets to deeply investigating a single Streptomyces strain. Our results show that it is possible to find novel chemistry through a limited screening effort, provided that appropriate selection criteria are in place.	0
Title: Solution structures of spinach acyl carrier protein with decanoate and stearate Abstract: Acyl carrier protein (ACP) is a cofactor in a variety of biosynthetic pathways, including fatty acid metabolism. Thus, it is of interest to determine structures of physiologically relevant ACP-fatty acid complexes. We report here the NMR solution structures of spinach ACP with decanoate (10:0-ACP) and stearate (18:0-ACP) attached to the 4'-phosphopantetheine prosthetic group. The protein in the fatty acid complexes adopts a single conformer, unlike apo- and holo-ACP, which interconvert in solution between two major conformers. The protein component of both 10:0- and 18:0-ACP adopts the four-helix bundle topology characteristic of ACP, and a fatty acid binding cavity was identified in both structures. Portions of the protein close in space to the fatty acid and the 4'-phosphopantetheine were identified using filtered/edited NOESY experiments. A docking protocol was used to generate protein structures containing bound fatty acid for 10:0- and 18:0-ACP. In both cases, the predominant structure contained fatty acid bound down the center of the helical bundle, in agreement with the location of the fatty acid binding pockets. These structures demonstrate the conformational flexibility of spinach ACP and suggest how the protein changes to accommodate its myriad binding partners.	0
Title: The genome sequence of Streptomyces lividans 66 reveals a novel tRNA-dependent peptide biosynthetic system within a metal-related genomic island Abstract: The complete genome sequence of the original isolate of the model actinomycete Streptomyces lividans 66, also referred to as 1326, was deciphered after a combination of next-generation sequencing platforms and a hybrid assembly pipeline. Comparative analysis of the genomes of S. lividans 66 and closely related strains, including S. coelicolor M145 and S. lividans TK24, was used to identify strain-specific genes. The genetic diversity identified included a large genomic island with a mosaic structure, present in S. lividans 66 but not in the strain TK24. Sequence analyses showed that this genomic island has an anomalous (G + C) content, suggesting recent acquisition and that it is rich in metal-related genes. Sequences previously linked to a mobile conjugative element, termed plasmid SLP3 and defined here as a 94 kb region, could also be identified within this locus. Transcriptional analysis of the response of S. lividans 66 to copper was used to corroborate a role of this large genomic island, including two SLP3-borne "cryptic" peptide biosynthetic gene clusters, in metal homeostasis. Notably, one of these predicted biosynthetic systems includes an unprecedented nonribosomal peptide synthetase--tRNA-dependent transferase biosynthetic hybrid organization. This observation implies the recruitment of members of the leucyl/phenylalanyl-tRNA-protein transferase family to catalyze peptide bond formation within the biosynthesis of natural products. Thus, the genome sequence of S. lividans 66 not only explains long-standing genetic and phenotypic differences but also opens the door for further in-depth comparative genomic analyses of model Streptomyces strains, as well as for the discovery of novel natural products following genome-mining approaches.	1
Title: Tannerella forsythia strains display different cell-surface nonulosonic acids: biosynthetic pathway characterization and first insight into biological implications Abstract: Tannerella forsythia is an anaerobic, Gram-negative periodontal pathogen. A unique O-linked oligosaccharide decorates the bacterium's cell surface proteins and was shown to modulate the host immune response. In our study, we investigated the biosynthesis of the nonulosonic acid (NulO) present at the terminal position of this glycan. A bioinformatic analysis of T. forsythia genomes revealed a gene locus for the synthesis of pseudaminic acid (Pse) in the type strain ATCC 43037 while strains FDC 92A2 and UB4 possess a locus for the synthesis of legionaminic acid (Leg) instead. In contrast to the NulO in ATCC 43037, which has been previously identified as a Pse derivative (5-N-acetimidoyl-7-N-glyceroyl-3,5,7,9-tetradeoxy-l-glycero-l-manno-NulO), glycan analysis of strain UB4 performed in this study indicated a 350-Da, possibly N-glycolyl Leg (3,5,7,9-tetradeoxy-d-glycero-d-galacto-NulO) derivative with unknown C5,7 N-acyl moieties. We have expressed, purified and characterized enzymes of both NulO pathways to confirm these genes' functions. Using capillary electrophoresis (CE), CE-mass spectrometry and NMR spectroscopy, our studies revealed that Pse biosynthesis in ATCC 43037 essentially follows the UDP-sugar route described in Helicobacter pylori, while the pathway in strain FDC 92A2 corresponds to Leg biosynthesis in Campylobacter jejuni involving GDP-sugar intermediates. To demonstrate that the NulO biosynthesis enzymes are functional in vivo, we created knockout mutants resulting in glycans lacking the respective NulO. Compared to the wild-type strains, the mutants exhibited significantly reduced biofilm formation on mucin-coated surfaces, suggestive of their involvement in host-pathogen interactions or host survival. This study contributes to understanding possible biological roles of bacterial NulOs.	1
Title: Small pectinolytic spirochetes from the rumen Abstract: Two strains of small spirochetes utilizing pectin as sole source of energy for growth were isolated from the rumen of cattle and partially characterized. The pectinolytic enzyme produced by one of the organisms was classified as a poly-1,4-alpha-D-galacturonide lyase (EC 4.2.2.2). A pectinesterase (EC 3.1.1.11) was also produced.	0
Title: Patellamide A and C biosynthesis by a microcin-like pathway in Prochloron didemni, the cyanobacterial symbiont of Lissoclinum patella Abstract: Prochloron spp. are obligate cyanobacterial symbionts of many didemnid family ascidians. It has been proposed that the cyclic peptides of the patellamide class found in didemnid extracts are synthesized by Prochloron spp., but studies in which host and symbiont cells are separated and chemically analyzed to identify the biosynthetic source have yielded inconclusive results. As part of the Prochloron didemni sequencing project, we identified patellamide biosynthetic genes and confirmed their function by heterologous expression of the whole pathway in Escherichia coli. The primary sequence of patellamides A and C is encoded on a single ORF that resembles a precursor peptide. We propose that this prepatellamide is heterocyclized to form thiazole and oxazoline rings, and the peptide is cleaved to yield the two cyclic patellamides, A and C. This work represents the full sequencing and functional expression of a marine natural-product pathway from an obligate symbiont. In addition, a related cluster was identified in Trichodesmium erythraeum IMS101, an important bloom-forming cyanobacterium.	1
Title: A PCR method to identify ochratoxin A-producing Aspergillus westerdijkiae strains on dried and aged foods Abstract: Ochratoxins are a group of mycotoxins that frequently occur as contaminants in agricultural commodities and foods, including dry-cured meats and cheeses. The fungus Aspergillus westerdijkiae is frequently isolated from aged foods and can produce ochratoxin A (OTA). However, individual strains of the fungus can have one of two OTA production phenotypes (chemotypes): OTA production and OTA nonproduction. Monitoring and early detection of OTA-producing fungi in food are the most effective strategies to manage OTA contamination. Therefore, we examined genome sequence data from five A. westerdijkiae strains isolated from the surface of cheese from southern Italy to identify genetic markers indicative of the twoOTA chemotypes. This analysis revealed a naturally occurring deletion of the OTA regulatory gene, otaR, in an OTA-nonproducing isolate.We used this information to design a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method that could identify A. westerdijkiae and distinguish between the two OTA chemotypes. In this method, the PCR primers were complementary to conserved sequences flanking otaR and yielded different-sized amplicons from strains with the different chemotypes. The primers did not yield ota-region-specific amplicons from other OTA-producing species. Because the method is specific to A. westerdijkiae and can distinguish between the two OTA chemotypes, it has potential to significantly improve OTA monitoring programs.	1
Title: Secondary structure of the lac repressor DNA-binding domain by two-dimensional 1H nuclear magnetic resonance in solution Abstract: A recently proposed approach for spatial structure determination in noncrystalline proteins by nuclear magnetic resonance was applied to the lac repressor DNA-binding domain. On the basis of sequence-specific 1H NMR assignments, the location of alpha-helices in the amino acid sequence was determined from nuclear Overhauser enhancement data and from amide proton exchange studies. These investigations provide detailed experimental data on the structure of a noncrystalline DNA-binding protein. The results support the hypothesis advanced by others that sequence-specific interactions between lac repressor and DNA are mediated by a particular spatial arrangement of two alpha-helices common to various different DNA-binding proteins.	0
Title: Genome-based deletion analysis reveals the prenyl xanthone biosynthesis pathway in Aspergillus nidulans Abstract: Xanthones are a class of molecules that bind to a number of drug targets and possess a myriad of biological properties. An understanding of xanthone biosynthesis at the genetic level should facilitate engineering of second-generation molecules and increasing production of first-generation compounds. The filamentous fungus Aspergillus nidulans has been found to produce two prenylated xanthones, shamixanthone and emericellin, and we report the discovery of two more, variecoxanthone A and epishamixanthone. Using targeted deletions that we created, we determined that a cluster of 10 genes including a polyketide synthase gene, mdpG, is required for prenyl xanthone biosynthesis. mdpG was shown to be required for the synthesis of the anthraquinone emodin, monodictyphenone, and related compounds, and our data indicate that emodin and monodictyphenone are precursors of prenyl xanthones. Isolation of intermediate compounds from the deletion strains provided valuable clues as to the biosynthetic pathway, but no genes accounting for the prenylations were located within the cluster. To find the genes responsible for prenylation, we identified and deleted seven putative prenyltransferases in the A. nidulans genome. We found that two prenyltransferase genes, distant from the cluster, were necessary for prenyl xanthone synthesis. These genes belong to the fungal indole prenyltransferase family that had previously been shown to be responsible for the prenylation of amino acid derivatives. In addition, another prenyl xanthone biosynthesis gene is proximal to one of the prenyltransferase genes. Our data, in aggregate, allow us to propose a complete biosynthetic pathway for the A. nidulans xanthones.	1
Title: The thermostable alpha-L-rhamnosidase RamA of Clostridium stercorarium: biochemical characterization and primary structure of a bacterial alpha-L-rhamnoside hydrolase, a new type of inverting glycoside hydrolase Abstract: An alpha-L-rhamnosidase clone was isolated from a genomic library of the thermophilic anaerobic bacterium Clostridium stercorarium and its primary structure was determined. The recombinant gene product, RamA, was expressed in Escherichia coli, purified to homogeneity and characterized. It is a dimer of two identical subunits with a monomeric molecular mass of 95 kDa in SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. At pH 7.5 it is optimally active at 60 degrees C and insensitive to moderate concentrations of Triton X100, ethanol and EDTA. It hydrolysed p-nitrophenyl-alpha-L-rhamnopyranoside, naringin and hesperidin with a specific activity of 82, 1.5 and 0.46 U mg-1 respectively. Hydrolysis occurs by inversion of the anomeric configuration as detected using 1H-NMR, indicating a single displacement mechanism. Naringin was hydrolysed to rhamnose and prunin, which could further be degraded by incubation with a thermostable beta-glucosidase. The secondary structure of RamA consists of 27% alpha-helices and 50% beta-sheets, as detected by circular dichroism. The primary structure of the ramA gene has no similarity to other glycoside hydrolase sequences and possibly is the first member of a new enzyme family.	0
Title: Peplomycin sulfate and pulmonary fibrosis: hydroxyproline, uronic acid, proline hydroxylase and glucosamine 6-phosphate synthetase in lungs of hamsters treated with peplomycin Abstract: Effect of peplomycin sulfate (PLM) on pulmonary fibrosis was examined. Hydroxyproline, uronic acid, proline hydroxylase (EC 1.14.11.2) and glucosamine 6-phosphate synthetase (EC 2.6.1.16) in lungs of hamsters treated with PLM were studied and compared with those of hamsters treated with bleomycin (BLM). PLM, when administered intraperitoneally, one injection daily for 10 consecutive days, at either a high- (5 mg/kg) or low- (2.8 mg/kg) dosage-level, caused no significant increase of lung hydroxyproline and uronic acid as compared with controls. BLM on the other hand effected a significant increase in lung hydroxyproline on the high-dosage level (5 mg/kg) but not on the low-dosage level (2.8 mg/kg). In contrast, when administering PLM intratracheally, the concentrations of hydroxyproline in lungs increased 20% over the control levels. A transient increase of proline hydroxylase and glucosamine 6-phosphate synthetase also occurred shortly after the instillation. These increases were also observed in the corresponding groups treated with BLM, which confirmed the previous observations by other investigators. However, the magnitude of the increase was relatively lower in those values of PLM as compared with those of BLM. These data suggested that (1) PLM, when administered with multiple dosages intraperitoneally, showed no significant effect on the elevation of lung hydroxyproline; (2) PLM, when administered with a dose intratracheally, induced pulmonary fibrosis similar to that caused by BLM. However, the hydroxyproline accumulation in lungs of PLM-treated hamsters was less than in those of the BLM-treated; (3) The fibrotic effect on the lungs caused by either PLM or BLM was probably attributed to acceleration of the syntheses of collagen and acidic glycosaminoglycans.	0
Title: Identification of mureidomycin analogues and functional analysis of an N-acetyltransferase in napsamycin biosynthesis Abstract: Antibiotic abundance: Several new uridyl peptide antibiotics were identified from a heterologous producer strain containing the mureidomycin/napsamycin biosynthetic gene cluster by using HRMS and LC-ESI-MS/MS. Analysis of the new compounds and the corresponding gene cluster revealed NpsB, an N-acetyltransferase, to be responsible for acetylation of the uridyl peptide antibiotic.	1
Title: Involvement of the Baeyer-Villiger Monooxygenase IfnQ in the Biosynthesis of Isofuranonaphthoquinone Scaffold of JBIR-76 and -77 Abstract: JBIR-76 and -77 are isofuranonaphthoquinones (IFNQs) isolated from Streptomyces sp. RI-77. Draft genome sequencing and gene disruption analysis of Streptomyces sp. RI-77 showed that a type II polyketide synthase (PKS) gene cluster (ifn cluster) was responsible for the biosynthesis of JBIR-76 and -77. It was envisaged that an octaketide intermediate (C16 ) could be synthesized by the minimal PKS (IfnANO) and that formation of the IFNQ scaffold (C13 ) would therefore require a C-C bond cleavage reaction. An ifnQ disruptant accumulated some shunt products (C15 ), which were presumably produced by spontaneous cyclization of the decarboxylated octaketide intermediate. Recombinant IfnQ catalyzed the Baeyer-Villiger oxidation of 1-(2-naphthyl)acetone, an analogue of the bicyclic octaketide intermediate. Based on these results, we propose a pathway for the biosynthesis of JBIR-76 and -77, involving IfnQ-catalyzed C-C bond cleavage as a key step in the formation of the IFNQ scaffold.	1
Title: Aromatic prenylation in phenazine biosynthesis: dihydrophenazine-1-carboxylate dimethylallyltransferase from Streptomyces anulatus Abstract: The bacterium Streptomyces anulatus 9663, isolated from the intestine of different arthropods, produces prenylated derivatives of phenazine 1-carboxylic acid. From this organism, we have identified the prenyltransferase gene ppzP. ppzP resides in a gene cluster containing orthologs of all genes known to be involved in phenazine 1-carboxylic acid biosynthesis in Pseudomonas strains as well as genes for the six enzymes required to generate dimethylallyl diphosphate via the mevalonate pathway. This is the first complete gene cluster of a phenazine natural compound from streptomycetes. Heterologous expression of this cluster in Streptomyces coelicolor M512 resulted in the formation of prenylated derivatives of phenazine 1-carboxylic acid. After inactivation of ppzP, only nonprenylated phenazine 1-carboxylic acid was formed. Cloning, overexpression, and purification of PpzP resulted in a 37-kDa soluble protein, which was identified as a 5,10-dihydrophenazine 1-carboxylate dimethylallyltransferase, forming a C-C bond between C-1 of the isoprenoid substrate and C-9 of the aromatic substrate. In contrast to many other prenyltransferases, the reaction of PpzP is independent of the presence of magnesium or other divalent cations. The K(m) value for dimethylallyl diphosphate was determined as 116 microm. For dihydro-PCA, half-maximal velocity was observed at 35 microm. K(cat) was calculated as 0.435 s(-1). PpzP shows obvious sequence similarity to a recently discovered family of prenyltransferases with aromatic substrates, the ABBA prenyltransferases. The present finding extends the substrate range of this family, previously limited to phenolic compounds, to include also phenazine derivatives.	1
Title: Biosynthesis of the halogenated mycotoxin aspirochlorine in koji mold involves a cryptic amino acid conversion Abstract: Aspirochlorine (1) is an epidithiodiketopiperazine (ETP) toxin produced from koji mold (Aspergillus oryzae), which has been used in the oriental cuisine for over two millennia. Considering its potential risk for food safety, we have elucidated the molecular basis of aspirochlorine biosynthesis. By a combination of genetic and chemical analyses we found the acl gene locus and identified the key role of AclH as a chlorinase. Stable isotope labeling, biotransformation, and mutational experiments, analysis of intermediates and an in vitro adenylation domain assay gave totally unexpected insights into the acl pathway: Instead of one Phe and one Gly, two Phe units are assembled by an iterative non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS, AclP), followed by halogenation and an unprecedented Phe to Gly amino acid conversion. Biological assays showed that both amino acid transformations are required to confer cytotoxicity and antifungal activity to the mycotoxin.	1
Title: Molecular and genetic inflammation networks in major human diseases Abstract: It has been well-recognized that inflammation alongside tissue repair and damage maintaining tissue homeostasis determines the initiation and progression of complex diseases. Albeit with the accomplishment of having captured the most critical inflammation-involved molecules, genetic susceptibilities, epigenetic factors, and environmental factors, our schemata on the role of inflammation in complex diseases remain largely patchy, in part due to the success of reductionism in terms of research methodology per se. Omics data alongside the advances in data integration technologies have enabled reconstruction of molecular and genetic inflammation networks which shed light on the underlying pathophysiology of complex diseases or clinical conditions. Given the proven beneficial role of anti-inflammation in coronary heart disease as well as other complex diseases and immunotherapy as a revolutionary transition in oncology, it becomes timely to review our current understanding of the molecular and genetic inflammation networks underlying major human diseases. In this review, we first briefly discuss the complexity of infectious diseases and then highlight recently uncovered molecular and genetic inflammation networks in other major human diseases including obesity, type II diabetes, coronary heart disease, late onset Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and sporadic cancer. The commonality and specificity of these molecular networks are addressed in the context of genetics based on genome-wide association study (GWAS). The double-sword role of inflammation, such as how the aberrant type 1 and/or type 2 immunity leads to chronic and severe clinical conditions, remains open in terms of the inflammasome and the core inflammatome network features. Increasingly available large Omics and clinical data in tandem with systems biology approaches have offered an exciting yet challenging opportunity toward reconstruction of more comprehensive and dynamic molecular and genetic inflammation networks, which hold great promise in transiting network snapshots to video-style multi-scale interplays of disease mechanisms, in turn leading to effective clinical intervention.	0
Title: A newly described cellulosomal cellobiohydrolase, CelO, from Clostridium thermocellum: investigation of the exo-mode of hydrolysis, and binding capacity to crystalline cellulose Abstract: The sequence of the celO gene from Clostridium thermocellum F7 was determined. The gene product, cellulase CelO (Ct-Cel5F), had a modular structure consisting of a carbohydrate-binding module of the CBM3 family and a catalytic domain of the glycosyl hydrolase family 5. The presence of the dockerin module indicated that the enzyme was a component of the cellulosome complex. The thermostable recombinant gene product was active on cellodextrins, barley beta-glucan, carboxymethylcellulose and insoluble cellulose. Cellobiose was the only product released from amorphic and crystalline cellulose, cellotetraose and higher cello-oligosaccharides, identifying CelO as a cellobiohydrolase. The cleavage pattern of p-nitrophenyl beta-D-cellotetraoside, blockage of the hydrolysis of NaBH(4)-reduced cellopentaose and the reduction in substrate viscosity suggested activity from the reducing end in a processive mode after making random cuts. Binding to insoluble, i.e. amorphous, and crystalline cellulose was mediated by the carbohydrate-binding module CBM3b, with a preference for the crystalline substrate.	0
Title: Covalent inhibitors of human monoacylglycerol lipase: ligand-assisted characterization of the catalytic site by mass spectrometry and mutational analysis Abstract: The active site of recombinant hexa-histidine-tagged human monoacylglycerol lipase (hMGL) is characterized by mass spectrometry using the inhibitors 5-((biphenyl-4-yl)methyl)-N,N-dimethyl-2H-tetrazole-2-carboxamide (AM6701), and N-arachidonylmaleimide (NAM) as probes. Carbamylation of Ser(129) by AM6701 in the putative hMGL catalytic triad demonstrates this residue's essential role in catalysis. Partial NAM alkylation of hMGL cysteine residues 215 and/or 249 was sufficient to achieve approximately 80% enzyme inhibition. Although Cys(215) and/or Cys(249) mutations to alanine(s) did not affect hMGL hydrolytic activity as compared with nonmutated hMGL, the C215A displayed heightened NAM sensitivity, whereas the C249A evidenced reduced NAM sensitivity. These data conclusively demonstrate a sulfhydryl-based mechanism for NAM inhibition of hMGL in which Cys(249) is of paramount importance. Identification of amino acids critical to the catalytic activity and pharmacological modulation of hMGL informs the design of selective MGL inhibitors as potential drugs.	0
Title: Small-molecule screening identifies the selanazal drug ebselen as a potent inhibitor of DMT1-mediated iron uptake Abstract: HEK293T cells overexpressing divalent metal transporter-1 (DMT1) were established to screen for small-molecule inhibitors of iron uptake. Using a fluorescence-based assay, we tested 2000 known bioactive compounds to find 3 small molecules that potently block ferrous iron uptake. One of the inhibitors, ebselen, is a seleno compound used in clinical trials as a protective agent against ischemic stroke. Ebselen inhibited Fe(II) uptake (IC(50) of approximately 0.22 microM), but did not influence Fe(III) transport or DMT1-mediated manganese uptake. An unrelated antioxidant, pyrrolidine dithiobarbamate (PDTC), also inhibited DMT1 activity (IC(50) of approximately 1.54 microM). Both ebselen and PDTC increased cellular levels of reduced glutathione. These observations indicate that Fe(II) transport by DMT1 can be modulated by cellular redox status and suggest that ebselen may act therapeutically to limit iron-catalyzed damage due to transport inhibition.	0
Title: A TR-FRET-based functional assay for screening activators of CARM1 Abstract: Epigenetics is an emerging field that demands selective cell-permeable chemical probes to perturb, especially in vivo, the activity of specific enzymes involved in modulating the epigenetic codes. Coactivator-associated arginine methyltransferase 1 (CARM1) is a coactivator of estrogen receptor α (ERα), the main target in human breast cancer. We previously showed that twofold overexpression of CARM1 in MCF7 breast cancer cells increased the expression of ERα-target genes involved in differentiation and reduced cell proliferation, thus leading to the hypothesis that activating CARM1 by chemical activators might be therapeutically effective in breast cancer. Selective, potent, cell-permeable CARM1 activators will be essential to test this hypothesis. Here we report the development of a cell-based, time-resolved (TR) FRET assay that uses poly(A) binding protein 1 (PABP1) methylation to monitor cellular activity of CARM1. The LanthaScreen TR-FRET assay uses MCF7 cells expressing GFP-PABP1 fusion protein through BacMam gene delivery system, methyl-PABP1 specific antibody, and terbium-labeled secondary antibody. This assay has been validated as reflecting the expression and/or activity of CARM1 and optimized for high throughput screening to identify CARM1 allosteric activators. This TR-FRET platform serves as a generic tool for functional screening of cell-permeable, chemical modulators of CARM1 for elucidation of its in vivo functions.	0
Title: Cloning and elucidation of the FR901464 gene cluster revealing a complex acyltransferase-less polyketide synthase using glycerate as starter units Abstract: FR901464, an antitumor natural product, represents a new class of potent anticancer small molecules targeting spliceosome and inhibiting both splicing and nuclear retention of pre-mRNA. Herein we describe the biosynthetic gene cluster of FR901464, identified by degenerate primer PCR amplification of a gene encoding the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase (HCS) postulated to be involved in the biosynthesis of a β-branched polyketide from Pseudomonas sp. No. 2663. This cluster consists of twenty open reading frames (ORFs) and was localized to 93-kb DNA segment, and its involvement in FR901464 biosynthesis was confirmed by gene inactivation and complementation. FR901464 is biosynthesized by a hybrid polyketide synthase (PKS)/nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS), HCS, and acyltransferases (AT)-less system. The PKS/NRPS modules feature unusual domain organization including multiple domain redundancy, inactivation, and tandem. Biochemical characterization of a glyceryl transferase and an acyl carrier protein (ACP) in the start module revealed that it incorporates D-1,3-bisphosphoglycerate, which is dephosphorylated and transferred to ACP as the starter unit. Furthermore, an oxidative Baeyer-Villiger reaction followed by chain release was postulated to form a pyran moiety. On the basis of in silico analysis and genetic and biochemical evidances, a biosynthetic pathway for FR901464 was proposed, which sets the stage to further investigate the complex PKS biochemically and engineer the biosynthetic machinery for the production of novel analogues.	1
Title: Cloning of the polyketide synthase gene atX from Aspergillus terreus and its identification as the 6-methylsalicylic acid synthase gene by heterologous expression Abstract: Southern blot analysis of genomic DNAs of several fungi that produce polyketide compounds with the 6-methylsalicylic acid synthase (MSAS) gene of Penicillium patulum as a probe indicated the presence of an MSAS-homologous gene in the (+)-geodin-producing strain IMI 16,043 of Aspergillus terreus. The gene, designated atX was cloned from an A. terreus genomic DNA library and 7588 bp of the gene together with its flanking regions were sequenced to reveal the presence of a 5.5 kb open reading frame coding for a protein of 1800 amino acids with 190 kDa molecular mass. The presence of a short (70 bp) intron near the N-terminus of the atX gene was predicted that contains the canonical GT and AG dinucleotides at its 5'- and 3'-splicing junctions. The predicted ATX polypeptide showed high homology with P. patulum MSAS along the whole sequence. On the other hand, slight homology was detected only around the beta-ketoacyl synthase regions of Aspergillus nidulans wA, PKSST and Colletotrichum lagenarium PKS1. No transcription of atX was observed throughout the culture period by Northern blotting analysis. To identify the function of the polypeptide encoded by the atX gene, its coding region was introduced into the fungal expression vector pTAex3 under the control of the amyB promoter. The constructed expression plasmid was introduced into A. nidulans. The transformant produced significant amounts of 6-methylsalicylic acid, the structure of which was identified by physicochemical analysis. This result unambiguously demonstrated that the atX gene codes for MSAS of A. terreus.	1
Title: Redesigning enzymes based on adaptive evolution for optimal function in synthetic metabolic pathways Abstract: Nature has balanced most metabolic pathways such that no one enzyme in the pathway controls the flux through that pathway. However, unnatural or nonnative, constructed metabolic pathways may have limited product flux due to unfavorable in vivo properties of one or more enzymes in the pathway. One such example is the mevalonate-based isoprenoid biosynthetic pathway that we previously reconstructed in Escherichia coli. We have used a probable mechanism of adaptive evolution to engineer the in vivo properties of two enzymes (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase [tHMGR] and many terpene synthases) in this pathway and thereby eliminate or minimize the bottleneck created by these inefficient or nonfunctional enzymes. Here, we demonstrate how we significantly improved the productivity (by approximately 1000 fold) of this reconstructed biosynthetic pathway using this strategy. We anticipate that this strategy will find broad applicability in the functional construction (or reconstruction) of biological pathways in heterologous hosts.	0
Title: Pd(II)-Catalyzed Enantioselective γ-C(sp3)-H Functionalizations of Free Cyclopropylmethylamines Abstract: Prized for their ability to reliably forge stereocenters with precise regiocontrol from simple and abundant starting materials, substrate-directable enantioselective reactions are widely used in modern organic synthesis. As such, enantioselective C(sp3)-H functionalization reactions directed by innate functional groups could provide new routes to introduce molecular complexity within the inert hydrocarbon moiety, but to date this approach has been met with little success. While free primary aliphatic amines are common, versatile intermediates in synthesis, they are traditionally unreactive in C(sp3)-H activation reactions. Herein we report the Pd-catalyzed enantioselective C(sp3)-H functionalization of free aliphatic amines (cyclopropylmethylamines) enabled by a chiral bidentate thioether ligand. This ligand's privileged bidentate coordination mode and thioether motif favor the generation of the requisite mono(amine)-Pd(II) intermediate, thus enabling the enantioselective C-H activation of free amines. The resulting C-Pd(II) species could engage in either Pd(II)/Pd(IV) or Pd(II)/Pd(0) catalytic cycles, enabling access to a diverse range of products through (hetero)arylation, carbonylation, and olefination reactions. Consequently, this versatile reactivity offers medicinal chemists a general strategy to rapidly prepare and functionalize biologically relevant amines.	0
Title: Hypotension, autonomic failure, and cardiac hypertrophy in transgenic mice overexpressing the alpha 1B-adrenergic receptor Abstract: alpha(1)-Adrenergic receptors (alpha(1A), alpha(1B), and alpha(1D)) are regulators of systemic arterial blood pressure and blood flow. Whereas vasoconstrictory action of the alpha(1A) and alpha(1D) subtypes is thought to be mainly responsible for this activity, the role of the alpha(1B)-adrenergic receptor (alpha(1B)AR) in this process is controversial. We have generated transgenic mice that overexpress either wild type or constitutively active alpha(1B)ARs. Transgenic expression was under the control of the isogenic promoter, thus assuring appropriate developmental and tissue-specific expression. Cardiovascular phenotypes displayed by transgenic mice included myocardial hypertrophy and hypotension. Indicative of cardiac hypertrophy, transgenic mice displayed an increased heart to body weight ratio, which was confirmed by the echocardiographic finding of an increased thickness of the interventricular septum and posterior wall. Functional deficits included an increased isovolumetric relaxation time, a decreased heart rate, and cardiac output. Transgenic mice were hypotensive and exhibited a decreased pressor response. Vasoconstrictory regulation by alpha(1B)AR was absent as shown by the lack of phenylephrine-induced contractile differences between ex vivo mesenteric artery preparations. Plasma epinephrine, norepinephrine, and cortisol levels were also reduced in transgenic mice, suggesting a loss of sympathetic nerve activity. Reduced catecholamine levels together with basal hypotension, bradycardia, reproductive problems, and weight loss suggest autonomic failure, a phenotype that is consistent with the multiple system atrophy-like neurodegeneration that has been reported previously in these mice. These results also suggest that this receptor subtype is not involved in the classic vasoconstrictory action of alpha(1)ARs that is important in systemic regulation of blood pressure.	0
Title: Temporal and spatial regulation of microRNA activity with photoactivatable cantimirs Abstract: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that play numerous important roles in physiology and human diseases. During animal development, many miRNAs are expressed continuously from early embryos throughout adults, yet it is unclear whether these miRNAs are actually required at all the stages of development. Current techniques of manipulating microRNA function lack the required spatial and temporal resolution to adequately address the functionality of a given microRNA at a specific time or at single-cell resolution. To examine stage- or cell-specific function of miRNA during development and to achieve precise control of miRNA activity, we have developed photoactivatable antisense oligonucleotides against miRNAs. These caged oligonucleotides can be activated with 365 nm light with extraordinarily high efficiency to release potent antisense reagents to inhibit miRNAs. Initial application of these caged antimirs in a model organism (C. elegans) revealed that the activity of a miRNA (lsy-6) is required specifically around the comma stage during embryonic development to control a left/right asymmetric differentiation program in the C. elegans nervous system. This suggests that a transient input of lsy-6 during development is sufficient to specify the neuronal cell fate.	0
Title: Biosynthesis of Tropolones in Streptomyces spp.: Interweaving Biosynthesis and Degradation of Phenylacetic Acid and Hydroxylations on the Tropone Ring Abstract: Tropolonoids are important natural products that contain a unique seven-membered aromatic tropolone core and exhibit remarkable biological activities. 3,7-Dihydroxytropolone (DHT) isolated from Streptomyces species is a multiply hydroxylated tropolone exhibiting antimicrobial, anticancer, and antiviral activities. In this study, we determined the DHT biosynthetic pathway by heterologous expression, gene deletion, and biotransformation. Nine trl genes and some of the aerobic phenylacetic acid degradation pathway genes (paa) located outside the trl biosynthetic gene cluster are required for the heterologous production of DHT. The trlA gene encodes a single-domain protein homologous to the C-terminal enoyl coenzyme A (enoyl-CoA) hydratase domain of PaaZ. TrlA truncates the phenylacetic acid catabolic pathway and redirects it toward the formation of heptacyclic intermediates. TrlB is a 3-deoxy-d-arabino-heptulosonic acid-7-phosphate (DAHP) synthase homolog. TrlH is an unusual bifunctional protein bearing an N-terminal prephenate dehydratase domain and a C-terminal chorismate mutase domain. TrlB and TrlH enhanced de novo biosynthesis of phenylpyruvate, thereby providing abundant precursor for the prolific production of DHT in Streptomyces spp. Six seven-membered carbocyclic compounds were identified from the trlC, trlD, trlE, and trlF deletion mutants. Four of these chemicals, including 1,4,6-cycloheptatriene-1-carboxylic acid, tropone, tropolone, and 7-hydroxytropolone, were verified as key biosynthetic intermediates. TrlF is required for the conversion of 1,4,6-cycloheptatriene-1-carboxylic acid into tropone. The monooxygenases TrlE and TrlCD catalyze the regioselective hydroxylations of tropone to produce DHT. This study reveals a natural association of anabolism of chorismate and phenylpyruvate, catabolism of phenylacetic acid, and biosynthesis of tropolones in Streptomyces spp.IMPORTANCE Tropolonoids are promising drug lead compounds because of the versatile bioactivities attributed to their highly oxidized seven-membered aromatic ring scaffolds. Our present study provides clear insight into the biosynthesis of 3,7-dihydroxytropolone (DHT) through the identification of key genes responsible for the formation and modification of the seven-membered aromatic core. We also reveal the intrinsic mechanism of elevated production of DHT and related tropolonoids in Streptomyces spp. The study on DHT biosynthesis in Streptomyces exhibits a good example of antibiotic production in which both anabolic and catabolic pathways of primary metabolism are interwoven into the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites. Furthermore, our study sets the stage for metabolic engineering of the biosynthetic pathway for natural tropolonoid products and provides alternative synthetic biology tools for engineering novel tropolonoids.	1
Title: In vitro Cas9-assisted editing of modular polyketide synthase genes to produce desired natural product derivatives Abstract: One major bottleneck in natural product drug development is derivatization, which is pivotal for fine tuning lead compounds. A promising solution is modifying the biosynthetic machineries of middle molecules such as macrolides. Although intense studies have established various methodologies for protein engineering of type I modular polyketide synthase(s) (PKSs), the accurate targeting of desired regions in the PKS gene is still challenging due to the high sequence similarity between its modules. Here, we report an innovative technique that adapts in vitro Cas9 reaction and Gibson assembly to edit a target region of the type I modular PKS gene. Proof-of-concept experiments using rapamycin PKS as a template show that heterologous expression of edited biosynthetic gene clusters produced almost all the desired derivatives. Our results are consistent with the promiscuity of modular PKS and thus, our technique will provide a platform to generate rationally designed natural product derivatives for future drug development.	1
Title: Analysis of the biosynthesis genes and chemical components of the capsule of Avibacterium paragallinarum Abstract: The aim of this study was to investigate biosynthesis genes and chemical components of the capsule of Avibacterium paragallinarum. The sequence of a 10-kb region containing the capsule biosynthetic locus of Av. paragallinarum was determined. Two reference strains, i.e., 221 (serovar A) and H18 (serovar C), together with four Taiwanese field strains (all serovar C) were sequenced. The results showed that there are two genotypes (I and II) of the capsule biosynthetic locus in Av. paragallinarum, and the capsule genotype is independent of the serovar. The capsule biosynthetic loci of genotypes I and II consisted of six and five genes, respectively. The genotype I genes encoded proteins that are most similar to proteins from Pasteurella multocida capsule types A and F while the genotype II genes encoded proteins most similar to proteins from P. multocida capsule type D and Escherichia coli K5. The results suggested that genotype I strains contain hyaluronan or chondroitin in the capsule wall while genotype II contain heparosan. Enzymatic digestion of the capsule materials extracted from Av. paragallinarum showed that genotype I strains contained chondroitin while genotype II strains contained heparosan in the capsule. This is the first report on the existence of different genotypes of capsule biosynthesis genes in Av. paragallinarum and the presence of chondroitin and heparosan as chemical components of the capsule of Av. paragallinarum.	1
Title: Fate of Salmonella montevideo on and in raw tomatoes as affected by temperature and treatment with chlorine Abstract: A study was undertaken to determine the survival patterns of Salmonella montevideo G4639 on and in tomatoes during storage and the efficacy of chlorine treatment on inactivation of the pathogen. The population of S. montevideo on the surfaces of inoculated tomatoes stored at 10 degrees C did not change significantly (P < 0.05) throughout an 18-day storage period. Significant increases in population occurred within 7 days and within 1 day when tomatoes were stored at 20 and 30 degrees C, respectively. A significantly higher number of cells was taken up by the core tissue of tomatoes tempered at 25 degrees C when the tomatoes were dipped in a suspension at 10 degrees C compared with the number taken up when the tomatoes were dipped in cell suspensions tempered at 25 or 37 degrees C. Populations remained constant throughout subsequent storage for 8 days at 10 degrees C, regardless of the temperature differential between tomatoes and the dip suspension. Storage of tomatoes at 20 degrees C, however, resulted in significant increases in populations of S. montevideo. Populations of the pathogen on the surfaces and in the core tissues of tomatoes were significantly reduced by dipping for 2 min in a solution containing 60 or 110 ppm (60 or 110 micrograms/ml) chlorine, respectively; however, treatment in solution containing 320 ppm chlorine did not result in complete inactivation. Populations of S. montevideo remained unchanged in chopped tomatoes stored at 5 degrees C for 216 h (9 days) but increased significantly after storage for 96 or 22 h at 20 or 30 degrees C, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)	0
Title: Chemical Protein Ubiquitylation with Preservation of the Native Cysteine Residues Abstract: We report a cysteine-based ligation strategy for generating a monoubiquitylated protein while preserving the native cysteine residues on the acceptor protein. In monoubiquitylation of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) this method circumvents the need to mutate the native cysteine residues on PCNA. The chemically ubiquitylated PCNA contains a noncleavable linkage of the same length as the native isopeptide linkage. It also retains the normal function of the native Ub-PCNA in stimulating the ATPase activity of replication factor C (RFC) and lesion bypass synthesis by Polη. This method may be adapted for chemical ubiquitylation of other proteins and for site-specific modification of a target protein at a specific site through sulfhydryl chemistry.	0
Title: Functional analysis of genes from Streptomyces griseus involved in the synthesis of isorenieratene, a carotenoid with aromatic end groups, revealed a novel type of carotenoid desaturase Abstract: The biosynthesis of the aromatic carotene isorenieratene is restricted to green photosynthetic bacteria and a few actinomycetes. Among them Streptomyces griseus has been used to study the genes involved in this pathway. Five genes out of seven of two adjacent operons in one cluster could be identified to be sufficient for the synthesis of isorenieratene. Stepwise deletions of these genes demonstrated their participation in phytoene synthesis, phytoene desaturation and lycopene cyclization. The novel gene crtU was assigned to encode a unique desaturase responsible for the conversion of beta-carotene via beta-isorenieratene to isorenieratene by a desaturation/methyltransferation mechanism. Sequence analysis of crtU revealed two conserved regions, one at the N-terminus and the other at the C-terminus of the protein which is universal to different types of carotene desaturases. In addition, the sequence comprises a motif typically found in methyltransferases. The deletion of the two remaining genes of the cluster left the carotenoid biosynthetic pathway unaffected.	1
Title: Discovery of Pyranoviolin A and Its Biosynthetic Gene Cluster in Aspergillus violaceofuscus Abstract: A new polyketide-non-ribosomal peptide hybrid molecule, pyranoviolin A (1), was discovered from the genome-sequenced fungus Aspergillus violaceofuscus CBS 115571 and was characterized to be the first pyranonigrin analog harboring the C-3 methoxy group. Examination of the genome sequence of the fungus identified a putative biosynthetic gene cluster of 1, which was designated as the pyv cluster. The gene deletion experiment of the polyketide synthase (PKS)-non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) hybrid gene in the cluster confirmed the involvement of the pyv cluster in the pyranoviolin A biosynthesis. Finally, a plausible biosynthetic route leading to 1 has been proposed based on the bioinformatic analysis. Our study indicates that metabolite analysis of genome-sequenced microorganisms whose metabolites have been largely unexplored facilitates the discovery of new secondary metabolites along with their biosynthetic gene clusters.	1
Title: Chromosome replication in Myxococcus xanthus Abstract: The rates of DNA synthesis during the cell-division cycle were measured in Myxococcus xanthus growing in three different media permitting a twofold variation in doubling time. In all three media, simple DNA cycles were observed. Synthesis of DNA occurred during 85% of the cell-division cycle, independent of generation time, from 5 to 11 h. Cells were observed to contain one bacterial nucleoid at birth that later divided synchronously midway through the cell cycle. Nucleoid segregation appeared to begin before chromosome replication was completed. The DNA content of exponential-phase bacteria was determined to be about 20 +/- 3 X 10(-9) microgram per cell; newborn bacteria contained about 14 +/- 2 X 10(-9) microgram of DNA per cell. Exponential-phase bacteria showed about a 50% increase in DNA in the presence of chloramphenicol (50 microgram/ml). The number of randomly segregating chromosomes present in exponential-phase bacteria was determined by following the fate of prelabeled DNA during outgrowth in nonradioactive media. The results are consistent with a model in which cells are born with exactly one complete unreplicated chromosome. The molecular weight of such a chromosome is about 8.4 +/- 1.2 X 10(9).	0
Title: Diversity and seasonality of bioluminescent Vibrio cholerae populations in Chesapeake Bay Abstract: Association of luminescence with phenotypic and genotypic traits and with environmental parameters was determined for 278 strains of Vibrio cholerae isolated from the Chesapeake Bay during 1998 to 2000. Three clusters of luminescent strains (A, B, and C) and two nonluminescent clusters (X and Y) were identified among 180 clonal types. V. cholerae O1 strains isolated during pandemics and endemic cholera in the Ganges Delta were related to cluster Y. Heat-stable enterotoxin (encoded by stn) and the membrane protein associated with bile resistance (encoded by ompU) were found to be linked to luminescence in strains of cluster A. Succession from nonluminescent to luminescent populations of V. cholerae occurred during spring to midsummer. Occurrence of cluster A strains in water with neutral pH was contrasted with that of cluster Y strains in water with a pH of >8. Cluster A was found to be associated with a specific calanoid population cooccurring with cyclopoids. Cluster B was related to cluster Y, with its maximal prevalence at pH 8. Occurrence of cluster B strains was more frequent with warmer water temperatures and negatively correlated with maturity of the copepod community. It is concluded that each cluster of luminescent V. cholerae strains occupies a distinct ecological niche. Since the dynamics of these niche-specific subpopulations are associated with zooplankton community composition, the ecology of luminescent V. cholerae is concluded to be related to its interaction with copepods and related crustacean species.	0
Title: Cross-Platform DNA Encoding for Single-Cell Imaging of Gene Expression Abstract: Integration of imaging data across different molecular target types can provide in-depth insight into cell physiology and pathology, but remains challenging owing to poor compatibility between target-type-specific labeling methods. We show that cross-platform imaging analysis can be readily achieved through DNA encoding of molecular targets, which translates the molecular identity of various target types into a uniform in situ array of ssDNA tags for subsequent labeling with complementary imaging probes. The concept was demonstrated through multiplexed imaging of mRNAs and their corresponding proteins with multicolor quantum dots. The results reveal heterogeneity of cell transfection with siRNA and outline disparity in RNA interference (RNAi) kinetics at the level of both the mRNA and the encoded protein.	0
Title: Characterization of the function of the ver-1A and ver-1B genes, involved in aflatoxin biosynthesis in Aspergillus parasiticus Abstract: The ver-1A gene was cloned and its nucleotide sequence was determined as part of a previous study on aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) biosynthesis in the filamentous fungus Aspergillus parasiticus SU-1. A second copy of this gene, ver-1B, was tentatively identified in this fungal strain. In this study, ver-1B was cloned by screening an A. parasiticus cosmid library with a ver-1A probe. The nucleotide sequence of ver-1B was determined. The predicted amino acid sequence of ver-1B had 95% identity with ver-1A. A translational stop codon, found in the ver-1B gene coding region, indicated that it encodes a truncated polypeptide. To confirm the function of the ver-1 genes in AFB1 synthesis, a plasmid (pDV-VA) was designed to disrupt ver-1A and/or ver-1B by transformation of the AFB1 producer A. parasiticus NR-1. One disruptant, VAD-102, which accumulated the pathway intermediate versicolorin A was obtained. Southern hybridization analysis of VAD-102 revealed that ver-1A but not ver-1B was disrupted. A functional ver-1A gene was transformed back into strain VAD-102. Transformants which received ver-1A produced AFB1, confirming that ver-1A is the only functional ver-1 gene in A. parasiticus SU-1 and that its gene product is involved in the conversion of versicolorin A to sterigmatocystin in AFB1 biosynthesis. A duplicated chromosomal region (approximately 12 kb) was identified upstream from ver-1A and ver-1B by Southern hybridization analysis. This duplicated region contained the aflR gene, which is proposed to be one regulator of AFB1, synthesis. A similar gene duplication was also identified in several other strains of A. parasiticus.	1
Title: A gene cluster encoding resistomycin biosynthesis in Streptomyces resistomycificus; exploring polyketide cyclization beyond linear and angucyclic patterns Abstract: Resistomycin is a pentacyclic polyketide metabolite of Streptomyces resistomycificus that exhibits a variety of pharmacologically relevant properties. While virtually all bacterial aromatic polyketides can be grouped into linear and angular polyphenols, resistomycin has a unique "discoid" ring system. We have successfully identified the entire gene cluster encoding resistomycin biosynthesis by heterologously expressing a pooled cosmid library and screening for the fluorescence of the metabolite produced. The rem gene cluster exhibits several unusual features of the type II PKS involved, most remarkably a putative MCAT with highest homology to AT domains from modular PKSs. In addition, we provide the first insight into the molecular basis of a unique mode of cyclization giving rise to a discoid polyketide.	1
Title: Disodium Salts of Pseudoephedrine-Derived Myers Enolates: Stereoselectivity and Mechanism of Alkylation Abstract: Pseudoephedrine-derived dianionic Myers enolates were generated using sodium diisopropylamide (NaDA) in THF solution. The reactivities and selectivities of the disodium salts largely mirror those of the dilithium salts but without the requisite large excesses of inorganic salts (LiCl) or mandated dilute solutions. The disodium salts require careful control of temperature to preclude deleterious aggregate aging effects traced to changes in the aggregate structure and intervening O-alkylations. Structural studies and density functional theory (DFT) computations show a dominant highly symmetric polyhedron quite different from the lithium analogue. No enolate-NaDA mixed aggregates are observed with excess NaDA. Rate studies show an alkylation mechanism involving an intervening tetramer-monomer pre-equilibrium followed by rate-limiting alkylation of tetrasolvated monomers. DFT computations were conducted to explore the possible influences on stereochemistry. A crystal deriving from samples aged at ambient temperature contains six dianionic subunits and two monoanionic (alkoxide-only) subunits. A new preparation of concentrated solutions of NaDA in THF solution is described.	0
Title: Biosynthesis of crocacin involves an unusual hydrolytic release domain showing similarity to condensation domains Abstract: The crocacins are potent antifungal and cytotoxic natural compounds from myxobacteria of the genus Chondromyces. Although total synthesis approaches have been reported, the molecular and biochemical basis guiding the formation of the linear crocacin scaffold has remained unknown. Along with the identification and functional analysis of the crocacin biosynthetic gene cluster from Chondromyces crocatus Cm c5, we here present the identification and biochemical characterization of an unusual chain termination domain homologous to condensation domains responsible for hydrolytic release of the product from the assembly line. In particular, gene inactivation studies and in vitro experiments using the heterologously produced domain CroK-C2 confirm this surprising role giving rise to the linear carboxylic acid. Additionally, we determined the kinetic parameters of CroK-C2 by monitoring hydrolytic cleavage of the substrate mimic N-acetylcysteaminyl-crocacin B using an innovative high-performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry-based assay.	1
Title: The surface protein Shr of Streptococcus pyogenes binds heme and transfers it to the streptococcal heme-binding protein Shp Abstract: Background:                       The heme acquisition machinery in Streptococcus pyogenes is believed to consist of the surface proteins, Shr and Shp, and heme-specific ATP-binding cassette transporter HtsABC. Shp has been shown to rapidly transfer its heme to the lipoprotein component, HtsA, of HtsABC. The function of Shr and the heme source of Shp have not been established.                  Results:                       The objective of this study was to determine whether Shr binds heme and is a heme source of Shp. To achieve the objective, recombinant Shr protein was prepared. The purified Shr displays a spectrum typical of hemoproteins, indicating that Shr binds heme and acquires heme from Escherichia coli hemoproteins in vivo. Spectral analysis of Shr and Shp isolated from a mixture of Shr and heme-free Shp (apoShp) indicates that Shr and apoShp lost and gained heme, respectively; whereas Shr did not efficiently lose its heme in incubation with apoHtsA under the identical conditions. These results suggest that Shr directly transfers its heme to Shp. In addition, the rates of heme transfer from human hemoglobin to apoShp are close to those of simple ferric heme dissociation from hemoglobin, suggesting that methemoglobin does not directly transfer its heme to apoShp.                  Conclusion:                       We have demonstrated that recombinant Shr can acquire heme from E. coli hemoproteins in vivo and appears to directly transfer its heme to Shp and that Shp appears not to directly acquire heme from human methemoglobin. These results suggest the possibility that Shr is a source of heme for Shp and that the Shr-to-Shp heme transfer is a step of the heme acquisition process in S. pyogenes. Further characterization of the Shr/Shp/HtsA system would advance our understanding of the mechanism of heme acquisition in S. pyogenes.	0
Title: Discovery and Biosynthesis of Azabicyclene, a Conserved Nonribosomal Peptide in Pseudomonas aeruginosa Abstract: Azabicyclene, an azetidine-containing natural product, was identified using quorum-sensing molecules to upregulate expression of a gene cluster highly conserved in the human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Mutational studies of the gene cluster revealed essential genes for biosynthesis, including an unusual nonribosomal peptide synthetase. Reconstitution of this enzyme in vitro identified key biosynthetic intermediates. This work demonstrates a useful strategy for discovering quorum-sensing-regulated natural products. It sets the stage for understanding the biosynthesis and bioactivity of azabicyclene.	1
Title: Biosynthesis of diazepinomicin/ECO-4601, a Micromonospora secondary metabolite with a novel ring system Abstract: The novel microbial metabolite diazepinomicin/ECO-4601 (1) has a unique tricyclic dibenzodiazepinone core, which was unprecedented among microbial metabolites. Labeled feeding experiments indicated that the carbocyclic ring and the ring nitrogen of tryptophan could be incorporated via degradation to the 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid, forming ring A and the nonamide nitrogen of 1. Genomic analysis of the biosynthetic locus indicated that the farnesyl side chain was mevalonate derived, the 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid moiety could be formed directly from chorismate, and the third ring was constructed via 3-amino-5-hydroxybenzoic acid. Successful incorporation of 4,6-D2-3-hydroxyanthranilic acid into ring A of 1 via feeding experiments supports the genetic analysis and the allocation of the locus to this biosynthesis. These studies highlight the enzymatic complexity needed to produce this structural type, which is rare in nature.	1
Title: Antimicrobial and antiproliferative prospective of kosinostatin - a secondary metabolite isolated from Streptomyces sp Abstract: Cancer is a communal health hazard worldwide. The present investigation attempts to evaluate antimicrobial and anticancer potential of kosinostatin on mammary carcinoma cell line (MCF-7). The anticancer and antiproliferative activities of kosinostatin were analyzed on MCF cell line by MTT assay and cytotoxicity assays like lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and glutathione (GSH). The secondary metabolite kosinostatin exhibited its apoptotic nature by expressing p53 protein. Collectively, the results acquired from this study promise that kosinostatin shows the potent anticancer activity.	1
Title: Structure and biosynthesis of heat-stable antifungal factor (HSAF), a broad-spectrum antimycotic with a novel mode of action Abstract: A screen for antifungal compounds from Lysobacter enzymogenes strain C3, a bacterial biological control agent of fungal diseases, has previously led to the isolation of heat-stable antifungal factor (HSAF). HSAF exhibits inhibitory activities against a wide range of fungal species and shows a novel mode of antifungal action by disrupting the biosynthesis of a distinct group of sphingolipids. We have now determined the chemical structure of HSAF, which is identical to that of dihydromaltophilin, an antifungal metabolite with a unique macrocyclic lactam system containing a tetramic acid moiety and a 5,5,6-tricyclic skeleton. We have also identified the genetic locus responsible for the biosynthesis of HSAF in strain C3. DNA sequencing of this locus revealed genes for a hybrid polyketide synthase-nonribosomal peptide synthetase (PKS-NRPS), a sterol desaturase, a ferredoxin reductase, and an arginase. The disruption of the PKS-NRPS gene generated C3 mutants that lost the ability to produce HSAF and to inhibit fungal growth, demonstrating a hybrid PKS-NRPS that catalyzed the biosynthesis of the unique macrolactam system that is found in many biologically active natural products isolated from marine organisms. In addition, we have generated mutants with disrupted sterol desaturase, ferredoxin reductase, and arginase and examined the metabolites produced in these mutants. The work represents the first study of the genetic basis for the biosynthesis of the tetramic acid-containing macrolactams. The elucidation of the chemical structure of HSAF and the identification of the genetic locus for its biosynthesis establish the foundation for future exploitation of this group of compounds as new fungicides or antifungal drugs.	1
Title: Foreign insect hormones stimulating the transcription of the ie-1 promoter of Bombyx mori nuclear polyhedrosis virus in vivo and in vitro Abstract: Via a transient expression assay system, an experimental study was undertaken to characterize the effects of insect ecdysone and juvenile hormone analogue on the transient expression of the luciferase gene under the control of the immediate-early gene (ie-1) promoter of Bombyx mori nuclear polyhedrosis virus. The results demonstrated that the transcriptional activity of the ie-1 promoter was increased to a certain extent by different insect hormone treatments in uninfected insect cells or fifth instar silkworm larvae transfected with a plasmid containing a luciferase gene driven by the ie-1 promoter. By ecdysone treatment alone, an increase of 5-7 fold was reached in Bm-N, or Bm-5 cells, or in the early developmental stage of fifth instar larvae. By treatment with juvenile hormone analogue alone, about 2-fold, in Bm-N, Bm-5, and Sf-21 cells, or about 5-fold increase in the middle developmental stage of larvae was given, respectively. By co-treatment with ecdysone and juvenile hormone analogue, the incease was given between that of ecdysone and juvenile hormone analogue treatment alone. In addition, the synergistic effects of foreign/endogenous hormones on the activity of ie-1 promoter are discussed.	0
Title: Cloning and characterization of the astaxanthin biosynthesis gene cluster from the marine bacterium Paracoccus haeundaensis Abstract: Carotenoids are important natural pigments produced by many microorganisms and plants. In a previous study, we isolated and characterized a marine bacterium, Paracoccus haeundaensis, which produces carotenoids, mainly astaxanthin. In the present study, a carotenoid biosynthesis gene cluster involved in the production of astaxanthin was isolated and characterized from this marine bacterium. The cluster contained six carotenogenic genes, five of which, with the same orientation, were designated crtW, crtZ, crtY, crtI, and crtB, and one of which, with the opposite orientation, was designated crtE. The crtW, crtZ, crtY, crtI, crtB, and crtE genes contained 726, 486, 1158, 1503, 912, and 879 base pairs, respectively, and encoded polypeptides of 242, 162, 386, 501, 304, and 293 amino acid residues, respectively. The stop codon of each crt gene, except crtE, overlapped the start codon of the following crt gene. Comparisons of the structures and nucleotide sequences of the crt genes showed that the signature domains of the carotenoid biosynthesis genes are highly conserved. The molecular phylogenetic tree analysis showed the evolutionary relationships among the carotenoid biosynthesis genes of various organisms. An expression vector (pCR-XR-TOPO-Crt-full vector) containing the astaxanthin biosynthesis genes was constructed and transformed into Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) Codon Plus cells. The E. coli transformants produced 400 microg astaxanthin per gram of dry cell weight.	1
Title: AvaR2, a pseudo γ-butyrolactone receptor homologue from Streptomyces avermitilis, is a pleiotropic repressor of avermectin and avenolide biosynthesis and cell growth Abstract: Avermectins produced by Streptomyces avermitilis are effective anthelmintic agents. The autoregulatory signalling molecule that triggers avermectin biosynthesis is a novel butenolide-type molecule, avenolide, rather than common γ-butyrolactones (GBLs). We identified AvaR2, a pseudo GBL receptor homologue, as an important repressor of avermectin and avenolide biosynthesis and cell growth. AvaR2 directly repressed transcription of aveR (the ave cluster-situated activator gene), aco (a key gene for avenolide biosynthesis), its own gene (avaR2) and two other GBL receptor homologous genes (avaR1 and avaR3) by binding to their promoter regions. The aveR promoter had the highest affinity for AvaR2. A consensus 18 bp ARE (autoregulatory element)-like sequence was found in the AvaR2-binding regions of these five target genes. Eleven novel AvaR2 targets were identified, including genes involved in primary metabolism, ribosomal protein synthesis, and stress responses. AvaR2 bound and responded to endogenous avenolide and exogenous antibiotics jadomycin B (JadB) and aminoglycosides to modulate its DNA-binding activity. Our findings help to clarify the roles of pseudo GBL receptors as pleiotropic regulators and as receptors for new type autoregulator and exogenous antibiotic signal. A pseudo GBL receptor-mediated antibiotic signalling transduction system may be a common strategy that facilitates Streptomyces interspecies communication and survival in complex environments.	0
Title: Chemoselective immobilization of proteins by microcontact printing and bio-orthogonal click reactions Abstract: Herein, a combination of microcontact printing of functionalized alkanethiols and site-specific modification of proteins is utilized to chemoselectively immobilize proteins onto gold surfaces, either by oxime- or copper-catalyzed alkyne-azide click chemistry. Two molecules capable of click reactions were synthesized, an aminooxy-functionalized alkanethiol and an azide-functionalized alkanethiol, and self-assembled monolayer (SAM) formation on gold was confirmed by IR spectroscopy. The alkanethiols were then individually patterned onto gold surfaces by microcontact printing. Site-specifically modified proteins-horse heart myoglobin (HHMb) containing an N-terminal α-oxoamide and a red fluorescent protein (mCherry-CVIA) with a C-terminal alkyne-were immobilized by incubation onto respective stamped functionalized alkanethiol patterns. Pattern formation was confirmed by fluorescence microscopy.	0
Title: G-Quadruplex Formation in a Putative Coding Region of White Spot Syndrome Virus: Structural and Thermodynamic Aspects Abstract: White spot disease (WSD) is one of the most devastating viral infections of crustaceans caused by the white spot syndrome virus (WSSV). A conserved sequence WSSV131 in the DNA genome of WSSV was found to fold into a polymorphic G-quadruplex structure. Supported by two mutant sequences with single G→T substitutions in the third G4 tract of WSSV131, circular dichroism and NMR spectroscopic analyses demonstrate folding of the wild-type sequence into a three-tetrad parallel topology comprising three propeller loops with a major 1 : 3 : 1 and a minor 1 : 2 : 2 loop length arrangement. A thermodynamic analysis of quadruplex formation by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) indicates a thermodynamically more stable 1 : 3 : 1 loop isomer. DSC also revealed the formation of additional highly stable multimeric species with populations depending on potassium ion concentration.	0
Title: Overview of genomic and bioinformatic resources for Zymoseptoria tritici Abstract: Zymoseptoria tritici (syn. Mycosphaerella graminicola, Septoria tritici) is a haploid fungus belonging to the class Dothideomycetes. It is the causal agent of septoria leaf blotch - one of the world's most significant diseases of wheat. Here we review the genomic and bioinformatic resources that have been generated for Z. tritici. These include the whole-genome reference assembly for isolate IPO323, genome resequencing of alternate isolates, mitochondrial genome sequences, transcriptome sequences and expression data, and annotations of gene structure and function. We also highlight important advances in our fundamental knowledge of genome evolution and its effects on adaptation and pathogenicity in Z. tritici that have been facilitated by these resources.	0
Title: Activation of a p44 pseudogene in Anaplasma phagocytophila by bacterial RNA splicing: a novel mechanism for post-transcriptional regulation of a multigene family encoding immunodominant major outer membrane proteins Abstract: Immunodominant 44 kDa major outer membrane proteins of Anaplasma phagocytophila (human granulocytic ehrlichiosis agent) are encoded by the p44 multigene family. One of the paralogues, p44-18 is predominantly expressed by A. phagocytophila in mammalian hosts, but is downregulated in the arthropod vector. The expression of p44-18 was upregulated in A. phagocytophila cultivated in HL-60 cells at 37 degrees C compared with 24 degrees C. However, the molecular mechanism of such gene expression was unclear, as p44-18 has a pseudogene-like structure, i.e. it lacks an AUG start codon and is out of frame with an upstream overlapping paralogue, p44-1. In the present study, we found that an amplicon detected by reverse transciption-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) [808 basepair (bp)] for the p44-1/p44-18 gene locus was smaller than that detected by PCR with the genomic DNA (1652 bp) in the A. phagocytophila-infected HL-60 cells cultured at 37 degrees C. A circularized RNA molecule corresponding to the 844 bp region missing from the locus in the RT-PCR product was detected by inverse RT-PCR, indicating that this is an intron (designated p44-1 intervening sequence, p44-1 IVS). The splicing event of p44-1 IVS was also observed when the p44-1 IVS-carrying plasmid was introduced into Escherichia coli, suggesting that the splicing is sequence-dependent. Structural analysis and in vitro splicing experiments of p44-1 IVS suggested that this is likely to represent a new class of introns in eubacteria. The primer extension analysis showed the presence of a putative sigma(32)-type promoter in region upstream from p44-1. Collectively, the novel RNA splicing and the temperature-dependent transcription may account for the dominant p44-18 expression in mammals.	0
Title: Harnessing the synthetic capabilities of glycopeptide antibiotic tailoring enzymes: characterization of the UK-68,597 biosynthetic cluster Abstract: In this study, a draft genome sequence of Actinoplanes sp. ATCC 53533 was assembled, and an 81-kb biosynthetic cluster for the unusual sulfated glycopeptide UK-68,597 was identified. Glycopeptide antibiotics are important in the treatment of infections caused by Gram-positive bacteria. Glycopeptides contain heptapeptide backbones that are modified by many tailoring enzymes, including glycosyltransferases, sulfotransferases, methyltransferases, and halogenases, generating extensive chemical and functional diversity. Several tailoring enzymes in the cluster were examined in vitro for their ability to modify glycopeptides, resulting in the synthesis of novel molecules. Tailoring enzymes were also expressed in the producer of the glycopeptide aglycone A47934, generating additional chemical diversity. This work characterizes the biosynthetic program of UK-68,597 and demonstrates the capacity to expand glycopeptide chemical diversity by harnessing the unique chemistry of tailoring enzymes.	1
Title: Nutrient-regulated transcriptional responses in the brown tide-forming alga Aureococcus anophagefferens Abstract: Long-SAGE (serial analysis of gene expression) was used to profile the transcriptome of the brown tide-forming alga, Aureococcus anophagefferens, under nutrient replete (control), and nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) deficiency to understand how this organism responds at the transcriptional level to varying nutrient conditions. This approach has aided A. anophagefferens genome annotation efforts and identified a suite of genes upregulated by N and P deficiency, some of which have known roles in nutrient metabolism. Genes upregulated under N deficiency include an ammonium transporter, an acetamidase/formamidase and two peptidases. This suggests an ability to utilize reduced N compounds and dissolved organic nitrogen, supporting the hypothesized importance of these N sources in A. anophagefferens bloom formation. There are also a broad suite of P-regulated genes, including an alkaline phosphatase, and two 5'-nucleotidases, suggesting A. anophagefferens may use dissolved organic phosphorus under low phosphate conditions. These N- and P-regulated genes may be important targets for exploring nutrient controls on bloom formation in field populations.	0
Title: Simplified Monopalmitoyl Toll-like Receptor 2 Ligand Mini-UPam for Self-Adjuvanting Neoantigen-Based Synthetic Cancer Vaccines Abstract: Synthetic vaccines, based on antigenic peptides that comprise MHC-I and MHC-II T-cell epitopes expressed by tumors, show great promise for the immunotherapy of cancer. For optimal immunogenicity, the synthetic peptides (SPs) should be adjuvanted with suitable immunostimulatory additives. Previously, we have shown that improved immunogenicity in vivo is obtained with vaccine modalities in which an SP is covalently connected to an adjuvanting moiety, typically a ligand to Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2). SPs were covalently attached to UPam, which is a derivative of the classic TLR2 ligand Pam3 CysSK4 . A disadvantage of the triply palmitoylated UPam is its high lipophilicity, which precludes universal adoption of this adjuvant for covalent modification of various antigenic peptides as it renders the synthetic vaccine insoluble in several cases. Here, we report a novel conjugatable TLR2 ligand, mini-UPam, which contains only one palmitoyl chain, rather than three, and therefore has less impact on the solubility and other physicochemical properties of a synthetic peptide. In this study, we used SPs that contain the clinically relevant neoepitopes identified in a melanoma patient who completely recovered after T-cell therapy. Homogeneous mini-UPam-SP conjugates have been prepared in good yields by stepwise solid-phase synthesis that employed a mini-UPam building block pre-prepared in solution and the standard set of Fmoc-amino acids. The immunogenicity of the novel mini-UPam-SP conjugates was demonstrated by using the cancer patient's T-cells.	0
Title: Excess leucine intake induces serine dehydratase in rat liver Abstract: We have hypothesized that rat liver serine dehydratase (SDH) is induced in response to the amount of surplus amino acids from dietary protein. In the present study, we found that excess leucine intake strongly induced SDH activity in the liver but not in the kidney of rats. The increase in activity was accompanied by increases in the levels of SDH mRNA. On the other hand, isoleucine and valine had little effect on SDH induction. These results support our hypothesis and suggest that leucine is a signal for SDH induction.	0
Title: Regulatory mutations affecting the gluconate system in Escherichia coli Abstract: A spontaneously arising regulatory mutant of the gluconate system in Escherichia coli was isolated. This mutant became constitutive, probably in one step, for gluconate high-affinity transport, gluconokinase, and gluconate-6-P dehydrase. The mutation involved (gntR18) is cotransducible with asd. Pseudorevertants, derived from a mutant (M2) that shows a long lag for growth on gluconate mineral medium, were also isolated and characterized. They give constitutive levels of gluconokinase and gluconate-6-P dehydrase but lack high-affinity transport function. Genetic experiments performed with one of these pseudorevertants (M4) indicate that it carries a secondary mutation in the gntR gene. The M4 phenotype is thus the result of the interaction of expression of a constitutive mutation (gntR4) with the mutation of strain M2 (gntM2).	0
Title: EcpA, an extracellular protease, is a specific virulence factor required by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzicola but not by X. oryzae pv. oryzae in rice Abstract: Previously, 12 protease-deficient mutants of the Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzicola (Xoc) RS105 strain were recovered from a Tn5-tagged mutant library. In the current study, the Tn5 insertion site in each mutant was mapped. Mutations in genes encoding components of the type II secretion apparatus, cAMP regulatory protein, integral membrane protease subunit, S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase proenzyme and extracellular protease (ecpA(Xoc)) either partially or completely abolished extracellular protease activity (ECPA) and reduced virulence in rice. Transcription of ecpA(Xoc) was induced in planta in all the mutants except RΔecpA. Complementation of RΔecpA with ecpA(Xoc) in trans restored ECPA, virulence and bacterial growth in planta. Purified EcpA(Xoc) induced chlorosis- and necrosis-like symptoms similar to those induced by the pathogen when injected into rice leaves. Heterologous expression of ecpA(Xoc) conferred ECPA upon the vascular bacterium X. oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) and upon non-pathogenic Escherichia coli. Genetic analysis demonstrated that the C-terminal residues of EcpA in Xoo PXO99(A) and Xoc RS105 are different, and a frame shift in ecpA(Xoo) may explain the absence of EcpA activity in Xoo. Collectively, these results suggest that EcpA(Xoc) is a tissue-specific virulence factor for Xoc but not Xoo, although the two pathovars are closely related bacterial pathogens of rice.	0
Title: Analysis of genes involved in biosynthesis of the lantibiotic subtilin Abstract: Lantibiotics are peptide-derived antibiotics with high antimicrobial activity against pathogenic gram-positive bacteria. They are ribosomally synthesized and posttranslationally modified (N. Schnell, K.-D. Entian, U. Schneider, F. Götz, H. Zähner, R. Kellner, and G. Jung, Nature [London] 333:276-278, 1988). The most important lantibiotics are subtilin and the food preservative nisin, which both have a very similar structure. By using a hybridization probe specific for the structural gene of subtilin, spaS, the DNA region adjacent to spaS was isolated from Bacillus subtilis. Sequence analysis of a 4.9-kb fragment revealed several open reading frames with the same orientation as spaS. Downstream of spaS, no reading frames were present on the isolated XbaI fragment. Upstream of spaS, three reading frames, spaB, spaC, and spaT, were identified which showed strong homology to genes identified near the structural gene of the lantibiotic epidermin. The SpaT protein derived from the spaT sequence was homologous to hemolysin B of Escherichia coli, which indicated its possible function in subtilin transport. Gene deletions within spaB and spaC revealed subtilin-negative mutants, whereas spaT gene disruption mutants still produced subtilin. Remarkably, the spaT mutant colonies revealed a clumpy surface morphology on solid media. After growth on liquid media, spaT mutant cells agglutinated in the mid-logarithmic growth phase, forming longitudinal 3- to 10-fold-enlarged cells which aggregated. Aggregate formation preceded subtilin production and cells lost their viability, possibly as a result of intracellular subtilin accumulation. Our results clearly proved that reading frames spaB and spaC are essential for subtilin biosynthesis whereas spaT mutants are probably deficient in subtilin transport.	1
Title: Cohesin and CTCF differentially affect chromatin architecture and gene expression in human cells Abstract: Recent studies of genome-wide chromatin interactions have revealed that the human genome is partitioned into many self-associating topological domains. The boundary sequences between domains are enriched for binding sites of CTCC-binding factor (CTCF) and the cohesin complex, implicating these two factors in the establishment or maintenance of topological domains. To determine the role of cohesin and CTCF in higher-order chromatin architecture in human cells, we depleted the cohesin complex or CTCF and examined the consequences of loss of these factors on higher-order chromatin organization, as well as the transcriptome. We observed a general loss of local chromatin interactions upon disruption of cohesin, but the topological domains remain intact. However, we found that depletion of CTCF not only reduced intradomain interactions but also increased interdomain interactions. Furthermore, distinct groups of genes become misregulated upon depletion of cohesin and CTCF. Taken together, these observations suggest that CTCF and cohesin contribute differentially to chromatin organization and gene regulation.	0
Title: Activation and Identification of a Griseusin Cluster in Streptomyces sp. CA-256286 by Employing Transcriptional Regulators and Multi-Omics Methods Abstract: Streptomyces are well-known producers of a range of different secondary metabolites, including antibiotics and other bioactive compounds. Recently, it has been demonstrated that "silent" biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) can be activated by heterologously expressing transcriptional regulators from other BGCs. Here, we have activated a silent BGC in Streptomyces sp. CA-256286 by overexpression of a set of SARP family transcriptional regulators. The structure of the produced compound was elucidated by NMR and found to be an N-acetyl cysteine adduct of the pyranonaphtoquinone polyketide 3'-O-α-d-forosaminyl-(+)-griseusin A. Employing a combination of multi-omics and metabolic engineering techniques, we identified the responsible BGC. These methods include genome mining, proteomics and transcriptomics analyses, in combination with CRISPR induced gene inactivations and expression of the BGC in a heterologous host strain. This work demonstrates an easy-to-implement workflow of how silent BGCs can be activated, followed by the identification and characterization of the produced compound, the responsible BGC, and hints of its biosynthetic pathway.	1
Title: Calcium Regulates S100A12 Zinc Sequestration by Limiting Structural Variations Abstract: Antimicrobial proteins such as S100A12 and S100A8/A9 are highly expressed and secreted by neutrophils during infection and participate in human immune response by sequestering transition metals. At neutral pH, S100A12 sequesters Zn2+ with nanomolar affinity, which is further enhanced upon calcium binding. We investigated the pH dependence of human S100A12 zinc sequestration by using Co2+ as a surrogate. Apo-S100A12 exhibits strong Co2+ binding between pH 7.0 and 10.0 that progressively diminishes as the pH is decreased to 5.3. Ca2+ -S100A12 can retain nanomolar Co2+ binding up to pH 5.7. NMR spectroscopic measurements revealed that calcium binding does not alter the side-chain protonation of the Co2+ /Zn2+ binding histidine residues. Instead, the calcium-mediated modulation is achieved by restraining pH-dependent conformational changes to EF loop 1, which contains Co2+ /Zn2+ binding Asp25. This calcium-induced enhancement of Co2+ /Zn2+ binding might assist in the promotion of antimicrobial activities in humans by S100 proteins during neutrophil activation under subneutral pH conditions.	0
Title: Is the Illegal Trade of Glass Eels ( Anguilla anguilla) Increasing the Spread of Disease? A Case of EVEX Abstract: The European eel (Anguilla anguilla) is a catadromous species that inhabits the rivers of the Adriatic watershed in Croatia. It is a critically endangered fish species, according to the IUCN, due to its declining abundance in European rivers caused by overfishing and trafficking and by diseases caused by nematodes, pathogenic bacteria and viruses. An illegal parcel of glass eels was confiscated at the Zagreb Airport and was intended to re-populate Croatian rivers. Barcoding was employed to determine species affiliation, and a thorough health check was carried out. This study reports the evaluation of gross lesions, histological findings, and EVEX virus isolation and identification. Since the confiscated glass eels were of unknown origin and given the serological and genetic similarities of EVA and EVEX, we designed primers and probes for almost whole genome sequencing to elucidate the origin of glass eels based on viral phylogeny. Bayesian phylogeny showed that the isolated strain had the most common ancestor with a Danish isolate and likely evolved from the French isolate of EVEX. These findings are discussed in light of the divergence of recently isolated strains and their possible contribution to the decrease of the abundance of the European eel in European waters.	0
Title: Genetic basis for mycophenolic acid production and strain-dependent production variability in Penicillium roqueforti Abstract: Mycophenolic acid (MPA) is a secondary metabolite produced by various Penicillium species including Penicillium roqueforti. The MPA biosynthetic pathway was recently described in Penicillium brevicompactum. In this study, an in silico analysis of the P. roqueforti FM164 genome sequence localized a 23.5-kb putative MPA gene cluster. The cluster contains seven genes putatively coding seven proteins (MpaA, MpaB, MpaC, MpaDE, MpaF, MpaG, MpaH) and is highly similar (i.e. gene synteny, sequence homology) to the P. brevicompactum cluster. To confirm the involvement of this gene cluster in MPA biosynthesis, gene silencing using RNA interference targeting mpaC, encoding a putative polyketide synthase, was performed in a high MPA-producing P. roqueforti strain (F43-1). In the obtained transformants, decreased MPA production (measured by LC-Q-TOF/MS) was correlated to reduced mpaC gene expression by Q-RT-PCR. In parallel, mycotoxin quantification on multiple P. roqueforti strains suggested strain-dependent MPA-production. Thus, the entire MPA cluster was sequenced for P. roqueforti strains with contrasted MPA production and a 174bp deletion in mpaC was observed in low MPA-producers. PCRs directed towards the deleted region among 55 strains showed an excellent correlation with MPA quantification. Our results indicated the clear involvement of mpaC gene as well as surrounding cluster in P. roqueforti MPA biosynthesis.	1
Title: In vivo effects of deoxyspergualin (NKT-01) on lymphocyte activation in response to alloantigens Abstract: We studied the effects of deoxyspergualin (NKT-01) on the events of lymphocyte activation in vivo by inoculating mice in the footpad with allogeneic spleen cells, and compared the effects with those of cyclosporin A (CyA). The administration of NKT-01 increased the numbers of cells recovered from the popliteal lymph node (PLN) 7 days after inoculation, but inhibited the proliferation of these cells in the presence of exogenous interleukin 2 (IL-2). NKT-01 enhanced IL-2 production, but suppressed the production of macrophage activating factor (MAF) in the mixed lymphocyte reaction between the PLN cells and allogeneic spleen cells treated with mitomycin C. CyA decreased the numbers of PLN cells little, and suppressed the response to exogenous IL-2 and the production of both IL-2 and MAF. Results with tumor cells used as allogeneic cells suggested that there was a close relationship between the suppression of MAF production by NKT-01 and its inhibition of allograft rejection. The findings showed that NKT-01 inhibited both the MAF production by and the response to IL-2 of PLN cells, and that these effects were involved in the suppression of allograft rejection by NKT-01.	0
Title: A hybrid non-ribosomal peptide/polyketide synthetase containing fatty-acyl ligase (FAAL) synthesizes the β-amino fatty acid lipopeptides puwainaphycins in the Cyanobacterium Cylindrospermum alatosporum Abstract: A putative operon encoding the biosynthetic pathway for the cytotoxic cyanobacterial lipopeptides puwainphycins was identified in Cylindrospermum alatosporum. Bioinformatics analysis enabled sequential prediction of puwainaphycin biosynthesis; this process is initiated by the activation of a fatty acid residue via fatty acyl-AMP ligase and continued by a multidomain non-ribosomal peptide synthetase/polyketide synthetase. High-resolution mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy measurements proved the production of puwainaphycin F/G congeners differing in FA chain length formed by either 3-amino-2-hydroxy-4-methyl dodecanoic acid (4-methyl-Ahdoa) or 3-amino-2-hydroxy-4-methyl tetradecanoic acid (4-methyl-Ahtea). Because only one puwainaphycin operon was recovered in the genome, we suggest that the fatty acyl-AMP ligase and one of the amino acid adenylation domains (Asn/Gln) show extended substrate specificity. Our results provide the first insight into the biosynthesis of frequently occurring β-amino fatty acid lipopeptides in cyanobacteria, which may facilitate analytical assessment and development of monitoring tools for cytotoxic cyanobacterial lipopeptides.	1
Title: Shigella flexneri type III secretion system effectors OspB and OspF target the nucleus to downregulate the host inflammatory response via interactions with retinoblastoma protein Abstract: OspF, OspG and IpaH(9.8) are type III secretion system (T3SS) effectors of Shigella flexneri that downregulate the host innate immune response. OspF modifies mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways and polymorphonuclear leucocyte transepithelial migration associated with Shigella invasion. OspF also localizes in the nucleus to mediate chromatin remodelling, resulting in reduced transcription of inflammatory cytokines. We now report that OspB can be added to the set of S. flexneri T3SS effectors required to modulate the innate immune response. T84 cells infected with a Delta ospB mutant resulted in reduced polymorphonuclear leucocyte transepithelial migration and mitogen-activated protein kinase signalling. Tagged versions of OspB localized with endosomes and the nucleus. Further, T84 cells infected with the Delta ospB mutant showed increased levels of secreted IL-8 compared with wild-type infected cells. Both GST-OspB and GST-OspF coprecipitated retinoblastoma protein from host cell lysates. Because Delta ospB and Delta ospF mutants share similar phenotypes, and OspB and OspF share a host binding partner, we propose that OspB and OspF facilitate the remodelling of chromatin via interactions with retinoblastoma protein, resulting in diminished inflammatory cytokine production. The requirement of multiple T3SS effectors to modulate the innate immune response correlates to the complexity of the human immune system.	0
Title: Rapid Capture and Release of Nucleic Acids through a Reversible Photo-Cycloaddition Reaction in a Psoralen-Functionalized Hydrogel Abstract: Reversible immobilization of DNA and RNA is of great interest to researchers who seek to manipulate DNA or RNA in applications such as microarrays, DNA hydrogels, and gene therapeutics. However, there is no existing system that can rapidly capture and release intact nucleic acids. To meet this unmet need, we developed a functional hydrogel for rapid DNA/RNA capture and release based on the reversible photo-cycloaddition of psoralen and pyrimidines. The functional hydrogel can be easily fabricated through copolymerization of acrylamide with the synthesized allylated psoralen. The psoralen-functionalized hydrogel exhibits effective capture and release of nucleic acids spanning a wide range of lengths in a rapid fashion; over 90 % of the capture process is completed within 1 min, and circa 100 % of the release process is completed within 2 min. We observe no deleterious effects on the hybridization to the captured targets.	0
Title: A small-molecule inducer of PDX1 expression identified by high-throughput screening Abstract: Pancreatic and duodenal homeobox 1 (PDX1), a member of the homeodomain-containing transcription factor family, is a key transcription factor important for both pancreas development and mature β cell function. The ectopic overexpression of Pdx1, Neurog3, and MafA in mice reprograms acinar cells to insulin-producing cells. We developed a quantitative PCR-based gene expression assay to screen more than 60,000 compounds for expression of each of these genes in the human PANC-1 ductal carcinoma cell line. We identified BRD7552, which upregulated PDX1 expression in both primary human islets and ductal cells, and induced epigenetic changes in the PDX1 promoter consistent with transcriptional activation. Prolonged compound treatment induced both insulin mRNA and protein and also enhanced insulin expression induced by the three-gene combination. These results provide a proof of principle for identifying small molecules that induce expression of transcription factors to control cellular reprogramming.	0
Title: Enzymatic Self-Assembly Confers Exceptionally Strong Synergism with NF-κB Targeting for Selective Necroptosis of Cancer Cells Abstract: As a promising molecular process for selectively inhibiting cancer cells without inducing acquired drug resistance, enzyme-instructed self-assembly (EISA) usually requires relatively high dosages. Despite its discovery 30 years ago, the translation of the knowledge about NF-κB signaling into clinic remains complicated due to the broad roles of NF-κB in cellular regulation. Here we show that integrating EISA and NF-κB targeting boosts the efficacy of EISA over an order of magnitude without compromising selectivity against cancer cells. That is, in situ enzymatic self-assembly of a tetrapeptide results in nanofibers, which hardly affect cell viability, but lead to inductive expression of tumor necrosis factor receptor 2 (TNFR2) and decreased expression of three key proteins at the upstream of NF-κB pathway in the cancer cells. Adding the inhibitors targeting NF-κB further decreases the expressions of those upstream proteins, which turns the otherwise innocuous nanofibers to being lethal to the cancer cells, likely causing necroptosis. As the first case of using supramolecular processes to enable synthetic lethality, this work illustrates a versatile approach to translate key regulatory circuits into promising therapeutic targets.	0
Title: Gramillin A and B: Cyclic Lipopeptides Identified as the Nonribosomal Biosynthetic Products of Fusarium graminearum Abstract: The virulence and broad host range of Fusarium graminearum is associated with its ability to secrete an arsenal of phytotoxic secondary metabolites, including the regulated mycotoxins belonging to the deoxynivalenol family. The TRI genes responsible for the biosynthesis of deoxynivalenol and related compounds are usually expressed during fungal infection. However, the F. graminearum genome harbors an array of unexplored biosynthetic gene clusters that are also co-induced with the TRI genes, including the nonribosomal peptide synthetase 8 ( NRPS8) gene cluster. Here, we identify two bicyclic lipopeptides, gramillin A (1) and B (2), as the biosynthetic end products of NRPS8. Structural elucidation by high-resolution LC-MS and NMR, including 1H-15N-13C HNCO and HNCA on isotopically enriched compounds, revealed that the gramillins possess a fused bicyclic structure with ring closure of the main peptide macrocycle occurring via an anhydride bond. Through targeted gene disruption, we characterized the GRA1 biosynthetic gene and its transcription factor GRA2 in the NRPS8 gene cluster. Further, we show that the gramillins are produced in planta on maize silks, promoting fungal virulence on maize but have no discernible effect on wheat head infection. Leaf infiltration of the gramillins induces cell death in maize, but not in wheat. Our results show that F. graminearum deploys the gramillins as a virulence agent in maize, but not in wheat, thus displaying host-specific adaptation.	1
Title: Pseudomycoicidin, a Class II Lantibiotic from Bacillus pseudomycoides Abstract: Lantibiotics are ribosomally synthesized antimicrobial peptides with substantial posttranslational modifications. They are characterized by the unique amino acids lanthionine and methyllanthionine, which are introduced by dehydration of Ser/Thr residues and linkage of the resulting dehydrated amino acids with Cys residues. BLAST searches using the mersacidin biosynthetic enzyme (MrsM) in the NCBI database revealed a new class II lantibiotic gene cluster in Bacillus pseudomycoides DSM 12442. Production of an antimicrobial substance with activity against Gram-positive bacteria was detectable in a cell wash extract of this strain. The substance was partially purified, and mass spectrometric analysis predicted a peptide of 2,786 Da in the active fraction. In order to characterize the putative lantibiotic further, heterologous expression of the predicted biosynthetic genes was performed in Escherichia coli. Coexpression of the prepeptide (PseA) along with the corresponding modification enzyme (PseM) resulted in the production of a modified peptide with the corresponding mass, carrying four out of eight possible dehydrations and supporting the presence of four thioether and one disulfide bridge. After the proteolytic removal of the leader, the core peptide exhibited antimicrobial activity. In conclusion, pseudomycoicidin is a novel lantibiotic with antimicrobial activity that was heterologously produced in E. coli.	1
Title: Newly cultured bacteria with broad diversity isolated from eight-week continuous culture enrichments of cow feces on complex polysaccharides Abstract: One of the functions of the mammalian large intestinal microbiota is the fermentation of plant cell wall components. In ruminant animals, the majority of their nutrients are obtained via pregastric fermentation; however, up to 20% can be recovered from microbial fermentation in the large intestine. Eight-week continuous culture enrichments of cattle feces with cellulose and xylan-pectin were used to isolate bacteria from this community. A total of 459 bacterial isolates were classified phylogenetically using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Six phyla were represented: Firmicutes (51.9%), Bacteroidetes (30.9%), Proteobacteria (11.1%), Actinobacteria (3.5%), Synergistetes (1.5%), and Fusobacteria (1.1%). The majority of bacterial isolates had <98.5% identity to cultured bacteria with sequences in the Ribosomal Database Project and thus represent new species and/or genera. Within the Firmicutes isolates, most were classified in the families Lachnospiraceae, Ruminococcaceae, Erysipelotrichaceae, and Clostridiaceae I. The majority of the Bacteroidetes were most closely related to Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, B. ovatus, and B. xylanisolvens and members of the Porphyromonadaceae family. Many of the Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes isolates were related to species demonstrated to possess enzymes which ferment plant cell wall components; the others were hypothesized to cross-feed these bacteria. The microbial communities that arose in these enrichment cultures had broad bacterial diversity. With over 98% of the isolates not represented as previously cultured, there are new opportunities to study the genomic and metabolic capacities of these members of the complex intestinal microbiota.	0
Title: A cluster of structural and regulatory genes for light-induced carotenogenesis in Myxococcus xanthus Abstract: In the bacterium Myxococcus xanthus, several genes for carotenoid synthesis lie together at the carA-carB chromosomal locus and are co-ordinately activated by blue light. A 12-kb DNA stretch from wild-type M. xanthus has been sequenced that includes the entire carA-carB gene cluster. According to sequence analysis, the cluster contains 11 different genes. Intergenic distances are very short or nil (implying translational coupling), giving further support to previous evidence indicating that most (or all) of the genes in the cluster form a single operon. At the promoter region, a potential -35 site for the binding of sigma factors is found. However, the -10 region shows little similarity with analogous sites in other bacterial promoters. Five (possibly six) genes in the carA-carB operon code for enzymes acting on early or late steps of the pathway for carotenoid synthesis. Other genes in the operon show no overall similarity with previously known genes. However, peptide stretches in the predicted products of two genes exhibit strong similarity with the DNA binding domain of the MerR family of transcriptional regulators. At least one of the predicted DNA-binding domains is altered in a mutant strain affected in light-regulation of the car genes.	1
Title: Cloning and sequencing of the gene encoding the large (alpha-) subunit of the proteasome from Thermoplasma acidophilum Abstract: The gene encoding the alpha-subunit of the proteasome from the archaebacterium Thermoplasma acidophilum was cloned and sequenced. The gene encodes for a polypeptide with 233 amino acid residues and a calculated molecular weight of 25870. Sequence similarity of the alpha-subunit with the Saccharomyces cerevisiae wild-type suppressor gene scll+ encoded polypeptide, which is probably identical with the subunit YC7-alpha of the yeast proteasome, lends support to a putative role of proteasomes in the regulation of gene expression. The significant sequence similarity to the various subunits of eukaryotic proteasomes make it likely that proteasomal proteins are encoded by one gene family of ancient origin.	0
Title: Light activation of the LOV protein vivid generates a rapidly exchanging dimer Abstract: The fungal photoreceptor Vivid (VVD) plays an important role in the adaptation of blue-light responses in Neurospora crassa. VVD, an FAD-binding LOV (light, oxygen, voltage) protein, couples light-induced cysteinyl adduct formation at the flavin ring to conformational changes in the N-terminal cap (Ncap) of the VVD PAS domain. Size-exclusion chromatography (SEC), equilibrium ultracentrifugation, and static and dynamic light scattering show that these conformational changes generate a rapidly exchanging VVD dimer, with an expanded hydrodynamic radius. A three-residue N-terminal beta-turn that assumes two different conformations in a crystal structure of a VVD C71V variant is essential for light-state dimerization. Residue substitutions at a critical hinge between the Ncap and PAS core can inhibit or enhance dimerization, whereas a Tyr to Trp substitution at the Ncap-PAS interface stabilizes the light-state dimer. Cross-linking through engineered disulfides indicates that the light-state dimer differs considerably from the dark-state dimer found in VVD crystal structures. These results verify the role of Ncap conformational changes in gating the photic response of N. crassa and indicate that LOV-LOV homo- or heterodimerization may be a mechanism for regulating light-activated gene expression.	0
Title: Stereoselective synthesis of F-ring saturated estrone-derived inhibitors of Hedgehog signaling based on cyclopamine Abstract: Previous work in this laboratory established that the readily available F-ring aromatic analog of cyclopamine is a highly potent inhibitor of Hedgehog signaling.

Title: Iodothyronamines are oxidatively deaminated to iodothyroacetic acids in vivo Abstract: 3-Iodothyronamine (T(1)AM) and 3,3',5-triiodothyroacetic acid (Triac) are bioactive metabolites of the hormone thyroxine (T(4)). In the present study, the ability of T(1)AM and 3,3',5-triiodothyronamine (T(3)AM) to be metabolized to 3-iodothyroacetic acid (TA(1)) and Triac, respectively, was investigated. Both T(1)AM and T(3)AM were converted to their respective iodinated thyroacetic acid analogues in both cell and tissue extracts. This conversion could be significantly inhibited with the monamine oxidase (MAO) and semicarbazide-sensitive amine oxidase (SSAO) inhibitor iproniazid. TA(1) was found to be present in trace quantities in human serum and in substantial levels in serum from T(1)AM-treated rats. These results demonstrate that iodothyronamines are substrates for amine oxidases and that this metabolism may be the source of the corresponding endogenous arylacetic acid products Triac and TA(1).	0
Title: Direct observation of an enamine intermediate in amine catalysis Abstract: An enamine intermediate is believed to be the central feature of biological catalysts, such as aldolases and small molecule amine organocatalysts. Despite decades of investigation of naturally occurring aldolase enzymes and recent studies on designed aldolase antibodies and organocatalysts, direct structural observation of an enamine intermediate has proven to be rare. Herein, we report the observation of a stable enamine intermediate in the crystal structure of an aldolase antibody 33F12 in complex with a 1,3-diketone derivative. This enamine complex structure provides strong evidence that fewer residues are essential for amine catalysis within the hydrophobic environments of this catalytic antibody than speculated for natural aldolase enzymes and should serve to guide future studies aimed at the rational design of these types of catalysts, as well as organocatalysts. Indeed, enamine catalysis in proteins might be more simplistic than previously imagined.	0
Title: The Arabidopsis gain-of-function mutant ssi4 requires RAR1 and SGT1b differentially for defense activation and morphological alterations Abstract: A gain-of-function mutation in resistance (R) gene SSI4 causes constitutive activation of defense responses, spontaneous necrotic lesion formation, enhanced resistance against virulent pathogens, and a severe dwarf phenotype. Genetic analysis revealed that ssi4-induced H(2)O(2) accumulation and spontaneous cell death require RAR1, whereas ssi4-mediated stunting is dependent on SGT1b. By contrast, both RAR1 and SGT1b are required in a genetically additive manner for ssi4-induced disease resistance, SA accumulation, and lesion formation after pathogen infection. These data point to cooperative yet distinct functions of RAR1 and SGT1b in responses conditioned by a deregulated nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat protein. We also found that RAR1 and SGT1b together contribute to basal resistance because an ssi4 rar1 sgt1b triple mutant exhibited enhanced susceptibility to virulent pathogen infection compared with wild-type SSI4 plants. All ssi4-induced phenotypes were suppressed when plants were grown at 22 degrees C under high relative humidity. However, low temperature (16 degrees C) triggered ssi4-mediated cell death via an RAR1-dependent pathway even in the presence of high humidity. Thus, multiple environmental factors impact on ssi4 signaling, as has been observed for other constitutive defense mutants and R gene-triggered pathways.	0
Title: Regulation of lifespan by neural excitation and REST Abstract: The mechanisms that extend lifespan in humans are poorly understood. Here we show that extended longevity in humans is associated with a distinct transcriptome signature in the cerebral cortex that is characterized by downregulation of genes related to neural excitation and synaptic function. In Caenorhabditis elegans, neural excitation increases with age and inhibition of excitation globally, or in glutamatergic or cholinergic neurons, increases longevity. Furthermore, longevity is dynamically regulated by the excitatory-inhibitory balance of neural circuits. The transcription factor REST is upregulated in humans with extended longevity and represses excitation-related genes. Notably, REST-deficient mice exhibit increased cortical activity and neuronal excitability during ageing. Similarly, loss-of-function mutations in the C. elegans REST orthologue genes spr-3 and spr-4 elevate neural excitation and reduce the lifespan of long-lived daf-2 mutants. In wild-type worms, overexpression of spr-4 suppresses excitation and extends lifespan. REST, SPR-3, SPR-4 and reduced excitation activate the longevity-associated transcription factors FOXO1 and DAF-16 in mammals and worms, respectively. These findings reveal a conserved mechanism of ageing that is mediated by neural circuit activity and regulated by REST.	0
Title: Nucleoid condensation and cell division in Escherichia coli MX74T2 ts52 after inhibition of protein synthesis Abstract: The reorganization of the bacterial nucleoid of an Escherichia coli mutant, MX74T2 ts52, was studied by electron microscopy after protein synthesis inhibition by using whole mounts of cell ghosts, ultrathin-sectioning, and freeze-etching. The bacterial nucleoid showed two morphological changes after chloramphenicol addition: deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) localization and DNA condensation. DNA localization was observed 10 min after chloramphenicol addition; the DNA appeared as a compact, solid mass. DNA condensation was observed at 25 min; the nucleoid appeared as a cytoplasm-filled sphere, often opened at one end. Ribosomes were observed in the center. Giant nucleoids present in some mutant filaments showed fused, spherical nucleoids arranged linearly, suggesting that the tertiary structure of the nucleoid reflects the number of replicated genomes. Inhibitors which directly or indirectly blocked protein synthesis and caused DNA condensation were chloramphenicol, puromycin, amino acid starvation, rifampicin, or carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazone. All inhibitors that caused cell division in the mutant also caused condensation, although some inhibitors caused condensation without cell division. Nucleoid condensation appears to be related to chromosome structure rather than to DNA segregation upon cell division.	0
Title: γ-Tubulin complex in Trypanosoma brucei: molecular composition, subunit interdependence and requirement for axonemal central pair protein assembly Abstract: γ-Tubulin complex constitutes a key component of the microtubule-organizing center and nucleates microtubule assembly. This complex differs in complexity in different organisms: the budding yeast contains the γ-tubulin small complex (γTuSC) composed of γ-tubulin, gamma-tubulin complex protein (GCP)2 and GCP3, whereas animals contain the γ-tubulin ring complex (γTuRC) composed of γTuSC and three additional proteins, GCP4, GCP5 and GCP6. In Trypanosoma brucei, the composition of the γ-tubulin complex remains elusive, and it is not known whether it also regulates assembly of the subpellicular microtubules and the spindle microtubules. Here we report that the γ-tubulin complex in T. brucei is composed of γ-tubulin and three GCP proteins, GCP2-GCP4, and is primarily localized in the basal body throughout the cell cycle. Depletion of GCP2 and GCP3, but not GCP4, disrupted the axonemal central pair microtubules, but not the subpellicular microtubules and the spindle microtubules. Furthermore, we showed that the γTuSC is required for assembly of two central pair proteins and that γTuSC subunits are mutually required for stability. Together, these results identified an unusual γ-tubulin complex in T. brucei, uncovered an essential role of γTuSC in central pair protein assembly, and demonstrated the interdependence of individual γTuSC components for maintaining a stable complex.	0
Title: Heterologous Expression of the Nybomycin Gene Cluster from the Marine Strain Streptomyces albus subsp. chlorinus NRRL B-24108 Abstract: Streptomycetes represent an important reservoir of active secondary metabolites with potential applications in the pharmaceutical industry. The gene clusters responsible for their production are often cryptic under laboratory growth conditions. Characterization of these clusters is therefore essential for the discovery of new microbial pharmaceutical drugs. Here, we report the identification of the previously uncharacterized nybomycin gene cluster from the marine actinomycete Streptomyces albus subsp. chlorinus through its heterologous expression. Nybomycin has previously been reported to act against quinolone-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains harboring a mutated gyrA gene but not against those with intact gyrA. The nybomycin-resistant mutants generated from quinolone-resistant mutants have been reported to be caused by a back-mutation in the gyrA gene that restores susceptibility to quinolones. On the basis of gene function assignment from bioinformatics analysis, we suggest a model for nybomycin biosynthesis.	1
Title: A natural plasmid uniquely encodes two biosynthetic pathways creating a potent anti-MRSA antibiotic Abstract: Background:                       Understanding how complex antibiotics are synthesised by their producer bacteria is essential for creation of new families of bioactive compounds. Thiomarinols, produced by marine bacteria belonging to the genus Pseudoalteromonas, are hybrids of two independently active species: the pseudomonic acid mixture, mupirocin, which is used clinically against MRSA, and the pyrrothine core of holomycin.                  Methodology/principal findings:                       High throughput DNA sequencing of the complete genome of the producer bacterium revealed a novel 97 kb plasmid, pTML1, consisting almost entirely of two distinct gene clusters. Targeted gene knockouts confirmed the role of these clusters in biosynthesis of the two separate components, pseudomonic acid and the pyrrothine, and identified a putative amide synthetase that joins them together. Feeding mupirocin to a mutant unable to make the endogenous pseudomonic acid created a novel hybrid with the pyrrothine via "mutasynthesis" that allows inhibition of mupirocin-resistant isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase, the mupirocin target. A mutant defective in pyrrothine biosynthesis was also able to incorporate alternative amine substrates.                  Conclusions/significance:                       Plasmid pTML1 provides a paradigm for combining independent antibiotic biosynthetic pathways or using mutasynthesis to develop a new family of hybrid derivatives that may extend the effective use of mupirocin against MRSA.	1
Title: Unveiling of Swainsonine Biosynthesis via a Multibranched Pathway in Fungi Abstract: The indolizidine alkaloid swainsonine (SW) is a deadly mycotoxin to livestock that can be produced by different plant-associated fungi, including the endophytic entomopathogenic fungi Metarhizium species. The SW biosynthetic gene cluster has been identified but the genetic mechanism of SW biosynthesis remains obscure. To unveil the SW biosynthetic pathway, we performed gene deletions in M. robertsii, heterologous expression of a core biosynthetic gene, substrate feedings, mass spectrometry, and bioassay analyses in this study. It was unveiled that SW is produced via a multibranched pathway by the hybrid nonribosomal peptide-polyketide synthase (NRPS-PKS) gene cluster in M. robertsii. The precursor pipecolic acid can be converted from lysine by both the SW biosynthetic cluster and the unclustered genes such as lysine cyclodeaminase. The hybrid NRPS-PKS enzyme produces three intermediates with and without domain skipping. Intriguingly, the biosynthetic process is coupled with the cis to trans nonenzymatic epimerization of C1-OH for both hydroxyl- and dihydroxyl-indolizidine intermediates. We also found that SW production was dispensable for fungal colonization of plants and infection of insect hosts. Functional characterization of the SW biosynthetic genes in this study may benefit the safe use of Metarhizium fungi as insect biocontrol agents and the management of livestock pastures from SW contamination by genetic manipulation of the toxin-producing fungi.	1
Title: Identification of substituent groups and related genes involved in salecan biosynthesis in Agrobacterium sp. ZX09 Abstract: Salecan, a soluble β-1,3-D-glucan produced by a salt-tolerant strain Agrobacterium sp. ZX09, has been the subject of considerable interest in recent years because of its multiple bioactivities and unusual rheological properties in solution. In this study, both succinyl and pyruvyl substituent groups on salecan were identified by an enzymatic hydrolysis following nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), HPLC, and MS analysis. The putative succinyltransferase gene (sleA) and pyruvyltransferase gene (sleV) were determined and cloned. Disruption of the sleA gene resulted in the absence of succinyl substituent groups on salecan. This defect could be complemented by expressing the sleA cloned in a plasmid. Thus, the sleA and sleV genes located in a 19.6-kb gene cluster may be involved in salecan biosynthesis. Despite the lack of succinyl substituents, the molecular mass of salecan generated by the sleA mutant did not substantially differ from that generated by the wild-type strain. Loss of succinyl substituents on salecan changed its rheological characteristics, especially a decrease in intrinsic viscosity.	1
Title: Division cycle of Myxococcus xanthus. 3. Kinetics of cell growth and protein synthesis Abstract: The kinetics of cell growth and protein synthesis during the division cycle of Myxococcus xanthus was determined. The distribution of cell size for both septated and nonseptated bacteria was obtained by direct measurement of the lengths of 8,000 cells. The Collins-Richmond equation was modified to consider bacterial growth in two phases: growth and division. From the derived equation, the growth rate of individual cells was computed as a function of size. Nondividing cells (growth phase) comprised 91% of the population and took up 87% of the time of the division cycle. The absolute and specific growth rates of nondividing cells were observed to increase continually throughout the growth phase; the growth rate of dividing cells could not be determined accurately by this technique because of changes in the geometry of cells between the time of septation and physical separation. The rate of protein synthesis during the division cycle was measured by pulselabeling an exponential-phase culture with radio-active valine or arginine and then preparing the cells for quantitative autoradiography. By measuring the size of individual cells as well as the number of grains, the rate of protein synthesis as a function of cell size was obtained. Nondividing cells showed an increase in both the absolute and specific rates of protein synthesis throughout the growth phase; the specific rate of protein synthesis for dividing cells was low when compared to growthphase cells. Cell growth and protein synthesis are compared to the previously reported kinetics of deoxyribonucleic acid and ribonucleic acid synthesis during the division cycle.	0
Title: Sex-specific gene expression during asexual development of Neurospora crassa Abstract: The impact of loci that determine sexual identity upon the asexual, dominant stage of fungal life history has been well studied. To investigate their impact, expression differences between strains of different mating type during asexual development were assayed, with RNA sampled from otherwise largely isogenic mat A and mat a strains of Neurospora crassa at early, middle, and late clonal stages of development. We observed significant differences in overall gene expression between mating types across clonal development, especially at late development stages. The expression levels of mating-type genes and pheromone genes were assayed by reverse transcription and quantitative PCR, revealing expression of pheromone and receptor genes in strains of both mating types in all development stages, and revealing that mating type (mat) genes were increasingly expressed over the course of asexual development. Interestingly, among differentially expressed genes, the mat A genotype more frequently exhibited a higher expression level than mat a, and demonstrated greater transcriptional regulatory dynamism. Significant up-regulation of expression was observed for many late light-responsive genes at late asexual development stages. Further investigation of the impact of light and the roles of light response genes in asexual development of both mating types are warranted.	0
Title: Insights into Protein Stability in Cell Lysate by 19 F NMR Spectroscopy Abstract: In living organisms, protein folding and function take place in an inhomogeneous, highly crowded environment possessing a concentration of diverse macromolecules of up to 400 g/L. It has been shown that the intracellular environment has a pronounced effect on the stability, dynamics and function of the protein under study, and has for this reason to be considered. However, most protein studies neglect the presence of these macromolecules. Consequently, we probe here the overall thermodynamic stability of cold shock protein B from Bacillus subtilis (BsCspB) in cell lysate. We found that an increase in cell lysate concentration causes a monotonic increase in the thermodynamic stability of BsCspB. This result strongly underlines the importance of considering the biological environment when inherent protein parameters are quantitatively determined. Moreover, we demonstrate that targeted application of 19 F NMR spectroscopy operates as an ideal tool for protein studies performed in complex cellular surroundings.	0
Title: Cloning and characterization of a gene cluster for geldanamycin production in Streptomyces hygroscopicus NRRL 3602 Abstract: We illustrate the use of a PCR-based method by which the genomic DNA of a microorganism can be rapidly queried for the presence of type I modular polyketide synthase genes to clone and characterize, by sequence analysis and gene disruption, a major portion of the geldanamycin production gene cluster from Streptomyces hygroscopicus var. geldanus NRRL 3602.	1
Title: Heterologous expression and functional analysis of the gene cluster for the biosynthesis of and immunity to the lantibiotic, nukacin ISK-1 Abstract: Nukacin ISK-1 is a lantibiotic produced by Staphylococcus warneri ISK-1. The gene cluster of nukacin ISK-1 consists of at least nukAMTFEG, ORF1 and ORF7. In this study, we demonstrated the heterologous production of nukacin ISK-1 in Lactococcus lactis by the artificial polycistronic expression of nukAMTFEG-ORF7 under the control of the nisin-controlled expression (NICE) system. Consequently, the recombinant L. lactis showed antimicrobial activity. Mass analysis clarified the presence of nukacin ISK-1 produced in the culture supernatant. These results suggested that the recombinant L. lactis produced nukacin ISK-1 heterologously. Inactivation of nukA, -M or -T resulted in the complete loss of the nukacin ISK-1 production phenotype. This finding suggested that nukAMT are indispensably associated with the biosynthesis of nukacin ISK-1. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the heterologous production of lantibiotic using the NICE system.	1
Title: Highly water-soluble neutral BODIPY dyes with controllable fluorescence quantum yields Abstract: A series of novel highly water-soluble neutral BODIPY dyes have been obtained by functionalization of BODIPY dyes with branched oligo(ethylene glycol)methyl ether groups at positions 8, 2 and 6 or 4 and 4'. Use of an ortho-substituent group of branched oligo(ethylene glycol)methyl ether on the meso-phenyl ring of BODIPY dyes and replacement of the fluorine atoms of BODIPY dyes at positions 4 and 4' with methyloxy or ethynyl subunits significantly enhance fluorescence quantum yields of BODIPY dyes.	0
Title: Metformin Changes the Relationship between Blood Monocyte Toll-Like Receptor 4 Levels and Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease-Ex Vivo Studies Abstract: Background:                       Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) contributes to the development of NAFLD (nonalcoholic fatty liver disease) and MetS (metabolic syndrome). It is unclear whether anti-diabetic metformin affects TLR4 expression on blood monocytes, thereby protecting or improving inflammatory parameters. Therefore, we investigated TLR4 in patients with NAFLD meeting different sets of MetS criteria and linked the results with the disease burden.                  Methods:                       70 subjects were characterized and divided into three groups: (I) healthy individuals, (II) nonobese with NAFLD and without MetS, and (III) prediabetic, obese with NAFLD and MetS. We determined the concentrations of IL-1β, IL-6, TNFα, and monocyte TLR4 levels in fresh blood as well as in blood cultures with or without metformin supplementation.                  Results:                       The characteristics of the study groups revealed a significant association between NAFLD and BMI, MetS and inflammatory parameters, and TLR4. In ex vivo studies, 100 μM of metformin decreased the TLR4 level by 19.9% (II group) or by 35% (III group) as well as IL-1β and TNFα production. A stepwise multiple regression analysis highlighted a strong effect of metformin on attenuation of the link between TLR4 and NAFLD, and TNFα.                  Conclusion:                       We concluded that, by attenuation of the blood monocyte TLR4 level, metformin reduced their inflammatory potential-critical after recruitment these cells into liver. However, this finding should be confirmed after in vivo metformin administration.	0
Title: Biosynthesis of Trehangelin in Polymorphospora rubra K07-0510: Identification of Metabolic Pathway to Angelyl-CoA Abstract: Trehangelins are trehalose angelates discovered from endophytic actinomycete Polymorphospora rubra K07-0510. We identified the trehangelin biosynthetic gene cluster, including genes that encode a glycoside hydrolase-like protein (thgC), α-amylase (thgD), 3-ketoacyl-ACP synthase III (thgI), 3-ketoacyl-ACP reductase (thgK), enoyl-CoA hydratase (thgH) and acyl transferase (thgJ). Heterologous expression of thgH, thgI, thgJ and thgK confirmed the importance of these genes in the biosynthesis of trehangelin A. Enzymatic activity studies showed that ThgI catalyses the condensation of acetyl-CoA and methylmalonyl-CoA to 2-methylacetoacetyl-CoA (MAA-CoA), ThgK catalyses NADPH-dependent reduction of MAA-CoA to 3-hydroxy-2-methylbutyryl-CoA (HMB-CoA) and ThgH catalyses the dehydration of HMB-CoA to angelyl-CoA (AN-CoA). This is the first report on the elucidation of the enzymatic formation of AN-CoA.	1
Title: Covalent Targeting of Ras G12C by Rationally Designed Peptidomimetics Abstract: Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) play a critical role in fundamental biological processes. Competitive inhibition of these interfaces requires compounds that can access discontinuous binding epitopes along a large, shallow binding surface area. Conformationally defined protein surface mimics present a viable route to target these interactions. However, the development of minimal protein mimics that engage intracellular targets with high affinity remains a major challenge because mimicry of a portion of the binding interface is often associated with the loss of critical binding interactions. Covalent targeting provides an attractive approach to overcome the loss of noncovalent contacts but have the inherent risk of dominating noncovalent contacts and increasing the likelihood of nonselective binding. Here, we report the iterative design of a proteolytically stable α3β chimeric helix mimic that covalently targets oncogenic Ras G12C as a model system. We explored several electrophiles to optimize preferential alkylation with the desired C12 on Ras. The designed lead peptide modulates nucleotide exchange, inhibits activation of the Ras-mediated signaling cascade, and is selectively toxic toward mutant Ras G12C cancer cells. The relatively high frequency of acquired cysteines as missense mutations in cancer and other diseases suggests that covalent peptides may offer an untapped therapeutic approach for targeting aberrant protein interactions.	0
Title: Biosynthesis of Chlorinated Lactylates in Sphaerospermopsis sp. LEGE 00249 Abstract: Lactylates are an important group of molecules in the food and cosmetic industries. A series of natural halogenated 1-lactylates, chlorosphaerolactylates (1-4), were recently reported from Sphaerospermopsis sp. LEGE 00249. Here, we identify the cly biosynthetic gene cluster, containing all the necessary functionalities for the biosynthesis of the natural lactylates, based on in silico analyses. Using a combination of stable isotope incorporation experiments and bioinformatic analysis, we propose that dodecanoic acid and pyruvate are the key building blocks in the biosynthesis of 1-4. We additionally report minor analogues of these molecules with varying alkyl chains. This work paves the way to accessing industrially relevant lactylates through pathway engineering.	1
Title: A phosphopantetheinyl transferase gene essential for biosynthesis of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids from Moritella marina strain MP-1 Abstract: A phosphopantetheinyl transferase (PPTase) gene (pfaE), cloned from the docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)-producing bacterium Moritella marina strain MP-1, has an open reading frame of 861 bp encoding a 287-amino acid protein. When the pfaE gene was expressed with pfaA-D, which are four out of five essential genes for biosynthesis of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) derived from Shewanella pneumatophori SCRC-2738 in Escherichia coli, the recombinant produced 12% EPA of total fatty acids. This suggests that pfaE encodes a PPTase required for producing n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, which is probably involved in the synthesis of DHA in M. marina strain MP-1.	1
Title: Glucocorticoid compounds modify smoothened localization and hedgehog pathway activity Abstract: The Hedgehog signaling pathway is linked to a variety of diseases, notably a range of cancers. The first generation of drug screens identified Smoothened (Smo), a membrane protein essential for signaling, as an attractive drug target. Smo localizes to the primary cilium upon pathway activation, and this transition is critical for the response to Hedgehog ligands. In a high content screen directly monitoring Smo distribution in Hedgehog-responsive cells, we identified different glucocorticoids as specific modulators of Smo ciliary accumulation. One class promoted Smo accumulation, conferring cellular hypersensitivity to Hedgehog stimulation. In contrast, a second class inhibited Smo ciliary localization and signaling activity by both wild-type Smo, and mutant forms of Smo, SmoM2, and SmoD473H, that are refractory to previously identified Smo antagonists. These findings point to the potential for developing glucocorticoid-based pharmacological modulation of Smo signaling to treat mutated drug-resistant forms of Smo, an emerging problem in long-term cancer therapy. They also raise a concern about potential crosstalk of glucocorticoid drugs in the Hedgehog pathway, if therapeutic administration exceeds levels associated with on-target transcriptional mechanisms of glucocorticoid action.	0
Title: Genome mining of the sordarin biosynthetic gene cluster from Sordaria araneosa Cain ATCC 36386: characterization of cycloaraneosene synthase and GDP-6-deoxyaltrose transferase Abstract: Sordarin is a glycoside antibiotic with a unique tetracyclic diterpene aglycone structure called sordaricin. To understand its intriguing biosynthetic pathway that may include a Diels-Alder-type [4+2]cycloaddition, genome mining of the gene cluster from the draft genome sequence of the producer strain, Sordaria araneosa Cain ATCC 36386, was carried out. A contiguous 67 kb gene cluster consisting of 20 open reading frames encoding a putative diterpene cyclase, a glycosyltransferase, a type I polyketide synthase, and six cytochrome P450 monooxygenases were identified. In vitro enzymatic analysis of the putative diterpene cyclase SdnA showed that it catalyzes the transformation of geranylgeranyl diphosphate to cycloaraneosene, a known biosynthetic intermediate of sordarin. Furthermore, a putative glycosyltransferase SdnJ was found to catalyze the glycosylation of sordaricin in the presence of GDP-6-deoxy-d-altrose to give 4'-O-demethylsordarin. These results suggest that the identified sdn gene cluster is responsible for the biosynthesis of sordarin. Based on the isolated potential biosynthetic intermediates and bioinformatics analysis, a plausible biosynthetic pathway for sordarin is proposed.	1
Title: Purification and structure of mutacin B-Ny266: a new lantibiotic produced by Streptococcus mutans Abstract: Mutacins are bactericidal substances of proteinaceous nature produced by Streptococcus mutans. Lantibiotics are antibacterial substances containing post-translationally modified amino acids such as lanthionine. Mutacin B-Ny266 was purified from the cell pellet of S. mutans strain Ny266 by ethanol extraction at pH 2.0 followed by reversed-phase chromatography (Sep-Pak cartridge) and by HPLC on a C18 column. The mean purification factor was 3240 +/- 81 and the mean yield was 1.0 +/- 0.1%. Molecular mass of mutacin B-Ny266 as determined by mass spectroscopy is 2270.29 +/- 0.21 Da. The amino acid sequence of the purified active fraction was obtained by Edman degradation after treatment with alkaline ethanethiol. Twenty-one amino acids were detected in this analysis. Mutacin B-Ny266 belongs to the type A lantibiotics. The proposed sequence is: F-K-A-W-U-F-A-Abu-P-G-A-A-K-O-G-A-F-N-U-Y-A. The molecule differs from that of epidermin/staphylococcin 1580 and gallidermin at positions 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6.	1
Title: Pathway redesign for deoxyviolacein biosynthesis in Citrobacter freundii and characterization of this pigment Abstract: Violacein (Vio) is an important purple pigment with many potential bioactivities. Deoxyviolacein, a structural analog of Vio, is always synthesized in low concentrations with Vio in wild-type bacteria. Due to deoxyviolacein's low production and difficulties in isolation and purification, little has been learned regarding its function and potential applications. This study was the first effort in developing a stable and efficient biosynthetic system for producing pure deoxyviolacein. A recombinant plasmid with vioabce genes was constructed by splicing using an overlapping extension-polymerase chain reaction, based on the Vio-synthesizing gene cluster of vioabcde, originating from Duganella sp. B2, and was introduced into Citrobacter freundii. With the viod gene disrupted in the Vio synthetic pathway, Vio production was completely abolished and the recombinant C. freundii synthesized only deoxyviolacein. Interestingly, vioe gene expression was strongly stimulated in the viod-deleted recombinant strain, indicating that viod disruptions could potentially induce polar effects upon the downstream vioe gene within this small operon. Deoxyviolacein production by this strain reached 1.9 g/L in shaker flasks. The product exhibited significant acid/alkali and UV resistance as well as significant inhibition of hepatocellular carcinoma cell proliferation at low concentrations of 0.1-1 μM. These physical characteristics and antitumor activities of deoxyviolacein contribute to illuminating its potential applications.	1
Title: Structural Properties and Catalytic Implications of the SPASM Domain Iron-Sulfur Clusters in Methylorubrum extorquens PqqE Abstract: Understanding the relationship between the metallocofactor and its protein environment is the key to uncovering the mechanism of metalloenzymes. PqqE, a radical S-adenosylmethionine enzyme in pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) biosynthesis, contains three iron-sulfur cluster binding sites. Two auxiliary iron-sulfur cluster binding sites, designated as AuxI and AuxII, use distinctive ligands compared to other proteins in the family while their functions remain unclear. Here, we investigate the electronic properties of these iron-sulfur clusters and compare the catalytic efficiency of wild-type (WT) Methylorubrum extorquens AM1 PqqE to a range of mutated constructs. Using native mass spectrometry, protein film electrochemistry, and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, we confirm the previously proposed incorporation of a mixture of [2Fe-2S] and [4Fe-4S] clusters at the AuxI site and are able to assign redox potentials to each of the three iron-sulfur clusters. Significantly, a conservative mutation at AuxI, C268H, shown to selectively incorporate a [4Fe-4S] cluster, catalyzes an enhancement of uncoupled S-adenosylmethionine cleavage relative to WT, together with the elimination of detectable peptide cross-linked product. While a [4Fe-4S] cluster can be tolerated at the AuxI site, the aggregate findings suggest a functional [2Fe-2S] configuration within the AuxI site. PqqE variants with nondestructive ligand replacements at AuxII also show that the reduction potential at this site can be manipulated by changing the electronegativity of the unique aspartate ligand. A number of novel mechanistic features are proposed based on the kinetic and spectroscopic data. Additionally, bioinformatic analyses suggest that the unique ligand environment of PqqE may be relevant to its role in PQQ biosynthesis within an oxygen-dependent biosynthetic pathway.	0
Title: Expressed sequence tags and genes associated with loline alkaloid expression by the fungal endophyte Neotyphodium uncinatum Abstract: Loline alkaloids (LA), which are 1-aminopyrrolizidines with an oxygen bridge, are produced by Epichloë (anamorph=Neotyphodium) species, endophytes of grasses. LA are insecticidal, thus, helping to protect host plants from insect herbivory. The objective of this study was to identify genes associated with LA biosynthesis. Suppression subtractive hybridization PCR was used to isolate transcripts up-regulated during LA production in cultures of Neotyphodium uncinatum. Subtracted cDNAs were cloned and a lambda-phage cDNA library from an LA-expressing N. uncinatum culture was screened with subtracted cDNA. In BLAST searches, several cDNAs identified had sequence similarities to aspartate kinases and another with O-acetylhomoserine-(thiol)lyase. Differential expression of these two genes in LA-producing cultures of N. uncinatum was confirmed and in a survey of 23 isolates from 21 Neotyphodium and Epichloë species these two genes strictly correlated with LA production. These findings open up the possibility for detailed studies on genes and enzymes involved in LA production.	1
Title: Synthesis and evaluation of monophosphoryl lipid A derivatives as fully synthetic self-adjuvanting glycoconjugate cancer vaccine carriers Abstract: A fully synthetic carbohydrate-based cancer vaccine is an attractive concept, but an important topic in the area is to develop proper vaccine carriers that can improve the immunogenicity and other immunological properties of tumor-associated carbohydrate antigens (TACAs). In this context, four monophosphoryl derivatives of Neisseria meningitidis lipid A were synthesized via a highly convergent and effective strategy and evaluated as vaccine carriers and adjuvants. The conjugates of these monophosphoryl lipid A (MPLA) derivatives with a modified form of the sTn antigen were found to elicit high titers of antigen-specific IgG antibodies, indicating a T cell-dependent immune response, in the absence of an external adjuvant. It was concluded that MPLAs could be utilized as potent vaccine carriers and built-in adjuvants to create fully synthetic self-adjuvanting carbohydrate-based cancer vaccines. The lipid composition and structure of MPLA were shown to have a significant influence on its immunological activity, and among the MPLAs examined, natural N. meningitidis MPLA exhibited the most promising properties. Moreover, Titermax Gold, a conventional vaccine adjuvant, was shown to inhibit, rather than promote, the immunological activity of MPLA conjugates, maybe via interacting with MPLA.	0
Title: A naturally inspired antibiotic to target multidrug-resistant pathogens Abstract: Gram-negative bacteria are responsible for an increasing number of deaths caused by antibiotic-resistant infections1,2. The bacterial natural product colistin is considered the last line of defence against a number of Gram-negative pathogens. The recent global spread of the plasmid-borne mobilized colistin-resistance gene mcr-1 (phosphoethanolamine transferase) threatens the usefulness of colistin3. Bacteria-derived antibiotics often appear in nature as collections of similar structures that are encoded by evolutionarily related biosynthetic gene clusters. This structural diversity is, at least in part, expected to be a response to the development of natural resistance, which often mechanistically mimics clinical resistance. Here we propose that a solution to mcr-1-mediated resistance might have evolved among naturally occurring colistin congeners. Bioinformatic analysis of sequenced bacterial genomes identified a biosynthetic gene cluster that was predicted to encode a structurally divergent colistin congener. Chemical synthesis of this structure produced macolacin, which is active against Gram-negative pathogens expressing mcr-1 and intrinsically resistant pathogens with chromosomally encoded phosphoethanolamine transferase genes. These Gram-negative bacteria include extensively drug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii and intrinsically colistin-resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae, which, owing to a lack of effective treatment options, are considered among the highest level threat pathogens4. In a mouse neutropenic infection model, a biphenyl analogue of macolacin proved to be effective against extensively drug-resistant A. baumannii with colistin-resistance, thus providing a naturally inspired and easily produced therapeutic lead for overcoming colistin-resistant pathogens.	1
Title: Mithramycin SK, a novel antitumor drug with improved therapeutic index, mithramycin SA, and demycarosyl-mithramycin SK: three new products generated in the mithramycin producer Streptomyces argillaceus through combinatorial biosynthesis Abstract: To gain initial structure-activity relationships regarding the highly functionalized pentyl side chain attached at C-3 of mithramycin (MTM), we focused on a post-polyketide synthase (post-PKS) tailoring step of the MTM biosynthesis by Streptomyces argillaceus ATCC 12956, which was proposed to be catalyzed by ketoreductase (KR) MtmW. In this last step of the MTM biosynthesis, a keto group of the pentyl side chain is reduced to a secondary alcohol, and we anticipated the generation of an MTM derivative with an additional keto group in the 3-side chain. Insertional inactivation of mtmW, a gene located ca. 8 kb downstream of the mithramycin-PKS genes, yielded an S. argillaceus mutant, which accumulated three new mithramycin analogues, namely mithramycin SA, demycarosyl-mithramycin SK, and mithramycin SK (MTM-SK). The structures of these three compounds confirmed indirectly the proposed role of MtmW in MTM biosynthesis. However, the new mithramycin derivatives bear unexpectedly shorter 3-side chains (ethyl or butyl) than MTM, presumably caused by nonenzymatic rearrangement or cleavage reactions of the initially formed pentyl side chain with a reactive beta-dicarbonyl functional group. The major product, MTM-SK, was tested in vitro against a variety of human cancer cell lines, as well as in an in vitro toxicity assay, and showed an improved therapeutic index, in comparison to the parent drug, MTM.	1
Title: Generation of bioinspired structural colors via two-photon polymerization Abstract: Colors of crystals, pigments, metals, salt solutions and bioluminescence occur in nature due to the optical properties of electrons in atoms and molecules. However, colors can also result from interference effects on nanostructures. In contrast to artificial coloration, which are caused by well-defined regular structures, the structural colors of living organisms are often more intense and almost angle-independent. In this paper, we report the successful manufacturing of a lamellar nanostructure that mimics the ridge shape of the Morpho butterfly using a 3d-direct laser writing technique. The viewing angle dependency of the color was analyzed via a spectrometer and the structure was visualized using a scanning electron microscope. The generated nano- and micro-structures and their optical properties were comparable to those observed in the Morpho butterfly.	0
Title: Structure and biosynthesis of fumosorinone, a new protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B inhibitor firstly isolated from the entomogenous fungus Isaria fumosorosea Abstract: Fumosorinone, isolated from the entomogenous fungus Isaria fumosorosea, is a new 2-pyridone alkaloid which is elucidated by HRESIMS 1D and 2DNMR. Fumosorinone is structurally similar to tenellin and desmethylbassianin but it differs in chain length and degree of methylation. It is characterized by a classic noncompetitive inhibitor of protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (IC50 14.04μM) which was implicated as a negative regulator of insulin receptor signaling and a potential drug target for the treatment of type II diabetes and other associated metabolic syndromes. For further study, we identified the biosynthetic gene cluster of fumosorinone from ongoing genome sequencing project, and it was verified by a direct knock-out strategy, reported for the first time in I. fumosorosea, using the Agrobacterium-mediated transformation in conjunction with linear deletion cassettes. The biosynthetic gene cluster includes a hybrid polyketide synthase-nonribosomal peptide synthetase gene, two cytochrome P450 enzyme genes, a trans-enoyl reductase gene, and other two transcription regulatory genes. Comparison of fumosorinone biosynthetic cluster with known gene clusters gives further insight into biosynthesis of pyridone alkaloids and provides the foundation for combinatorial biosynthesis for new fumosorinone derivatives.	1
Title: Listeriolysin S, a novel peptide haemolysin associated with a subset of lineage I Listeria monocytogenes Abstract: Streptolysin S (SLS) is a bacteriocin-like haemolytic and cytotoxic virulence factor that plays a key role in the virulence of Group A Streptococcus (GAS), the causative agent of pharyngitis, impetigo, necrotizing fasciitis and streptococcal toxic shock syndrome. Although it has long been thought that SLS and related peptides are produced by GAS and related streptococci only, there is evidence to suggest that a number of the most notorious Gram-positive pathogenic bacteria, including Listeria monocytogenes, Clostridium botulinum and Staphylococcus aureus, produce related peptides. The distribution of the L. monocytogenes cluster is particularly noteworthy in that it is found exclusively among a subset of lineage I strains; i.e., those responsible for the majority of outbreaks of listeriosis. Expression of these genes results in the production of a haemolytic and cytotoxic factor, designated Listeriolysin S, which contributes to virulence of the pathogen as assessed by murine- and human polymorphonuclear neutrophil-based studies. Thus, in the process of establishing the existence of an extended family of SLS-like modified virulence peptides (MVPs), the genetic basis for the enhanced virulence of a proportion of lineage I L. monocytogenes may have been revealed.	1
Title: Two isozymes of clavaminate synthase central to clavulanic acid formation: cloning and sequencing of both genes from Streptomyces clavuligerus Abstract: Clavaminate synthase (CS) is an alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent oxygenase central to the biosynthesis of clavulanic acid, a potent inhibitor of beta-lactamases. CS catalyzes the oxidative cyclization/desaturation of proclavaminic acid to clavaminic acid in a two-step process involving the intermediacy of dihydroclavaminic acid [Salowe, S. P., Krol, W. J., Iwata-Reuyl, D., & Townsend, C. A. (1991) Biochemistry 30, 2281-2292]. During the purification of CS to homogeneity from Streptomyces clavuligerus [Salowe, S. P., Marsh, E. N., & Townsend, C. A. (1990) Biochemistry 29, 6499-6508], two forms of the enzyme capable of carrying out the complete reaction having very similar molecular weights and kinetic properties were isolated by Mono-Q chromatography. The gene for each has been cloned, sequenced, and found to be significantly homologous (87% identity). The two genes so isolated, cs1 and cs2, have open reading frames of 975 and 978 nucleotides, respectively, encoding proteins of M(r) 35,347 and 35,774. These genes are located in different loci of the genome separated by > 20 kbp. This separation is large for a natural product biosynthetic pathway in bacteria where gene duplication and limited divergence are typically observed to occur within narrower confines of a gene cluster. Sequence comparisons made between cs1/cs2 and other genes encoding iron-dependent proteins involved in penicillin and cephalosporin biosynthesis in the same organism show minimal homology. Further sequence alignments made to other non-heme iron oxygenases reveal unexpected dissimilarity within the alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent class itself. The limited data available suggests evolutionary convergence among these proteins.	1
Title: Synthesis of oxalamides by acceptorless dehydrogenative coupling of ethylene glycol and amines and the reverse hydrogenation catalyzed by ruthenium Abstract: A sustainable, new synthesis of oxalamides, by acceptorless dehydrogenative coupling of ethylene glycol with amines, generating H2, homogeneously catalyzed by a ruthenium pincer complex, is presented. The reverse hydrogenation reaction is also accomplished using the same catalyst. A plausible reaction mechanism is proposed based on stoichiometric reactions, NMR studies, X-ray crystallography as well as observation of plausible intermediates.	0
Title: Colibactin assembly line enzymes use S-adenosylmethionine to build a cyclopropane ring Abstract: Despite containing an α-amino acid, the versatile cofactor S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) is not a known building block for nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) assembly lines. Here we report an unusual NRPS module from colibactin biosynthesis that uses SAM for amide bond formation and subsequent cyclopropanation. Our findings showcase a new use for SAM and reveal a novel biosynthetic route to a functional group that likely mediates colibactin's genotoxicity.	0
Title: Evaluation of a 7-Methoxycoumarin-3-carboxylic Acid Ester Derivative as a Fluorescent, Cell-Cleavable, Phosphonate Protecting Group Abstract: Cell-cleavable protecting groups often enhance cellular delivery of species that are charged at physiological pH. Although several phosphonate protecting groups have achieved clinical success, it remains difficult to use these prodrugs in live cells to clarify biological mechanisms. Here, we present a strategy that uses a 7-methoxycoumarin-3-carboxylic acid ester as a fluorescent protecting group. This strategy was applied to synthesis of an (E)-4-hydroxy-3-methyl-but-2-enyl diphosphate (HMBPP) analogue to assess cellular uptake and human Vγ9Vδ2 T cell activation. The fluorescent ester displayed low cellular toxicity (IC50 >100 μm) and strong T cell activation (EC50 =0.018 μm) relative to the unprotected anion (EC50 =23 μm). The coumarin-derived analogue allowed no-wash analysis of biological deprotection, which revealed rapid internalization of the prodrug. These results demonstrate that fluorescent groups can be applied both as functional drug delivery tools and useful biological probes of drug uptake.	0
Title: Mechanism and Origins of Chemo- and Stereoselectivities of Aryl Iodide-Catalyzed Asymmetric Difluorinations of β-Substituted Styrenes Abstract: The mechanism of the aryl iodide-catalyzed asymmetric migratory geminal difluorination of β-substituted styrenes ( Banik et al. Science 2016, 353, 51 ) has been explored with density functional theory computations. The computed mechanism consists of (a) activation of iodoarene difluoride (ArIF2), (b) enantiodetermining 1,2-fluoroiodination, (c) bridging phenonium ion formation via SN2 reductive displacement, and (d) regioselective fluoride addition. According to the computational model, the ArIF2 intermediate is stabilized through halogen-π interactions between the electron-deficient iodine(III) center and the benzylic substituents at the catalyst stereogenic centers. Interactions with the catalyst ester carbonyl groups (I(III)+···O) are not observed in the unactivated complex, but do occur upon activation of ArIF2 through hydrogen-bonding interactions with external Brønsted acid (HF). The 1,2-fluoroiodination occurs via alkene complexation to the electrophilic, cationic I(III) center followed by C-F bond formation anti to the forming C-I bond. The bound olefin and the C-I bond of catalyst adopt a spiro arrangement in the favored transition structures but a nearly periplanar arrangement in the disfavored transition structures. Multiple attractive non-covalent interactions, including slipped π···π stacking, C-H···O, and C-H···π interactions, are found to underlie the high asymmetric induction. The chemoselectivity for 1,1-difluorination versus 1,2-difluorination is controlled mainly by (1) the steric effect of the substituent on the olefinic double bond and (2) the nucleophilicity of the carbonyl oxygen of substrate.	0
Title: Fusarium graminearum PKS14 is involved in orsellinic acid and orcinol synthesis Abstract: The available genome sequences show that the number of secondary metabolite genes in filamentous fungi vastly exceeds the number of known products. This is also true for the global plant pathogenic fungus Fusarium graminearum, which contains 15 polyketide synthase (PKS) genes, of which only 6 have been linked to products. To help remedy this, we focused on PKS14, which has only been shown to be expressed during plant infections or when cultivated on rice or corn meal (RM) based media. To enhance the production of the resulting product we introduced a constitutive promoter in front of PKS14 and cultivated two of the resulting mutants on RM medium. This led to the production of two compounds, which were only detected in the PKS14 overexpressing mutants and not in the wild type or PKS14 deletion mutants. The two compounds were tentatively identified as orsellinic acid and orcinol by comparing spectroscopic data (mass spectroscopy and chromatography) to authentic standards. NMR analysis of putative orcinol isolated from the PKS14 overexpressing mutant supported our identification. Orcinol and orsellinic acid, not previously detected in Fusarium, have primarily been detected in lichen fungi. Orsellinic acid is hypothesized to be the PKS release product which is transformed to orcinol through decarboxylation. Phylogenetic analyses of PKSs placed PKS14 in a subclade of known OA synthases. Expression analysis by microarray of 55 experiments identified seven genes near PKS14 that were expressed in a similar manner. One of the seven genes encodes a predicted carboxylase, which could be responsible for transforming orsellinic acid to orcinol.	1
Title: The ornibactin biosynthesis and transport genes of Burkholderia cenocepacia are regulated by an extracytoplasmic function sigma factor which is a part of the Fur regulon Abstract: Burkholderia cenocepacia mutants that fail to produce the siderophore ornibactin were obtained following mutagenesis with mini-Tn5Tp. These mutants were shown to be growth restricted under conditions of iron depletion. In eight of the mutants, the transposon had integrated into one of two genes, orbI and orbJ, encoding nonribosomal peptide synthetases. In the other mutant, the transposon had inserted into an open reading frame, orbS, located upstream from orbI. The polypeptide product of orbS exhibits a high degree of similarity to the Pseudomonas aeruginosa extracytoplasmic function (ECF) sigma factor PvdS but possesses an N-terminal extension of approximately 29 amino acids that is not present in PvdS. Three predicted OrbS-dependent promoters were identified within the ornibactin gene cluster, based on their similarity to PvdS-dependent promoters. The iron-regulated activity of these promoters was shown to require OrbS. Transcription of the orbS gene was found to be under the control of an iron-regulated sigma(70)-dependent promoter. This promoter, but not the OrbS-dependent promoters, was shown to be a target for repression by the global regulator Fur. Our results demonstrate that production of ornibactin by B. cenocepacia in response to iron starvation requires transcription of an operon that is dependent on the Fur-regulated ECF sigma factor gene orbS. A mechanism is also proposed for the biosynthesis of ornibactin.	1
Title: Small-molecule-mediated axonal branching in Caenorhabditis elegans Abstract: An in vivo system for monitoring small-molecule-mediated neuronal branching has been developed by using C. elegans. Growth-promoting compounds can be detected by visual inspection of GFPlabeled cholinergic neurons, as axonal branching occurs following treatment with neurotrophic agents. Investigation of the structure-activity relationship of the neurotrophic natural product clovanemagnolol (1) led us to a comparable chemically edited derivative.	0
Title: Genome analysis and polar tube firing dynamics of mosquito-infecting microsporidia Abstract: Microsporidia are highly divergent fungi that are obligate intracellular pathogens of a wide range of host organisms. Here we review recent findings from the genome sequences of mosquito-infecting microsporidian species Edhazardia aedis and Vavraia culicis, which show large differences in genome size, although similar numbers of predicted genes. We also show a video of E. aedis polar tube firing, which is the dramatic mechanism used by microsporidia to deliver the germ cell (sporoplasm) into the host cell to initiate intracellular infection.	0
Title: Biosynthesis of the cyclooligomer depsipeptide beauvericin, a virulence factor of the entomopathogenic fungus Beauveria bassiana Abstract: Beauvericin, a cyclohexadepsipeptide ionophore from the entomopathogen Beauveria bassiana, shows antibiotic, antifungal, insecticidal, and cancer cell antiproliferative and antihaptotactic (cell motility inhibitory) activity in vitro. The bbBeas gene encoding the BbBEAS nonribosomal peptide synthetase was isolated from B. bassiana and confirmed to be responsible for beauvericin biosynthesis by targeted disruption. BbBEAS utilizes D-2-hydroxyisovalerate (D-Hiv) and L-phenylalanine (Phe) for the iterative synthesis of a predicted N-methyl-dipeptidol intermediate, and forms the cyclic trimeric ester beauvericin from this intermediate in an unusual recursive process. Heterologous expression of the bbBeas gene in Escherichia coli to produce the 3189 amino acid, 351.9 kDa BbBEAS enzyme provided a strain proficient in beauvericin biosynthesis. Comparative infection assays with a BbBEAS knockout B. bassiana strain against three insect hosts revealed that beauvericin plays a highly significant but not indispensable role in virulence.	1
Title: New insights into the echinocandins and other fungal non-ribosomal peptides and peptaibiotics Abstract: Non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) are a primary modality for fungal peptidic natural product assembly and are responsible for some of the best known, most useful, and most destructive fungal metabolites. Through genome sequencing and computer-assisted recognition of modular motifs of catalytic domains, one can now confidently identify most NRPS biosynthetic genes of a fungal strain. The biosynthetic gene clusters responsible for two of the most important classes of NRP fungal derived drugs, cyclosporine and the echinocandins, have been recently characterized by genomic sequencing and annotation. Complete biosynthetic gene clusters for the pneumocandins and echinocandins have been mapped at the genetic level and functionally characterized to some extent. Genomic sequencing of representative strains of most of the variants in the echinocandin family, including the wild-type of the three fungal strains employed for industrial-scale production of caspofungin, micafungin and anidulofungin, has enabled characterization of the basic architecture of the echinocandin NRPS pathways. A comparative analysis of how pathway genes cause variations in lipoinitiation, biosynthesis of the non-proteinogenic amino acids, amino acid substitutions, and hydroxylations and sulfonations of the core peptide and contribute to the molecular diversity of the family is presented. We also review new information on the natural functions of NRPs, the differences between fungal and bacterial NRPSs, and functional characterization of selected NRPS gene clusters. Continuing discovery of the new fungal nonribosomal peptides has contributed new structural diversity and potential insights into their biological functions among other natural peptides and peptaibiotics. We therefore provide an update on new peptides, depsipeptides and peptaibols discovered in the Fungi since 2009.	1
Title: The ppuI-rsaL-ppuR quorum-sensing system regulates biofilm formation of Pseudomonas putida PCL1445 by controlling biosynthesis of the cyclic lipopeptides putisolvins I and II Abstract: Pseudomonas putida strain PCL1445 produces two cyclic lipopeptides, putisolvin I and putisolvin II, which possess surface tension-reducing abilities and are able to inhibit biofilm formation and to break down existing biofilms of several Pseudomonas spp., including P. aeruginosa. Putisolvins are secreted in the culture medium during growth at late exponential phase, indicating that production is possibly regulated by quorum sensing. In the present study, we identified a quorum-sensing system in PCL1445 that is composed of ppuI, rsaL, and ppuR and shows very high similarity with gene clusters of P. putida strains IsoF and WCS358. Strains with mutations in ppuI and ppuR showed a severe reduction of putisolvin production. Expression analysis of the putisolvin biosynthetic gene in a ppuI background showed decreased expression, which could be complemented by the addition of synthetic 3-oxo-C(10)-N-acyl homoserine lactone (3-oxo-C(10)-AHL) or 3-oxo-C(12)-AHL to the medium. An rsaL mutant overproduces AHLs, and production of putisolvins is induced early during growth. Analysis of biofilm formation on polyvinylchloride showed that ppuI and ppuR mutants produce a denser biofilm than PCL1445, which correlates with decreased production of putisolvins, whereas an rsaL mutant shows a delay in biofilm production, which correlates with early production of putisolvins. The results demonstrate that quorum-sensing signals induce the production of cyclic lipopeptides putisolvin I and II and consequently control biofilm formation by Pseudomonas putida.	1
Title: Characterization of Streptomyces argillaceus genes encoding a polyketide synthase involved in the biosynthesis of the antitumor mithramycin Abstract: Mithramycin (Mtm) is an aromatic polyketide which shows antibacterial and antitumor activity. From a chromosomal cosmid library of Streptomyces argillaceus, a Mtm producer, a clone (cosAR7) was isolated by homology to the actI/III region of S. coelicolor and the strDEM genes of S. griseus. From this clone, a 5.3-kb DNA region was sequenced and found to encode six open reading frames (designated as mtmQXPKST1), five of them transcribed in the same direction. The deduced products of five of these genes resembled components of type-II polyketide synthases. The mtm genes would code for an aromatase (mtmQ), a polypeptide of unknown function (mtmX), a beta-ketoacylsynthase (mtmP) and a related 'chain length factor' (mtmK), an acyl carrier protein (mtmS) and a beta-ketoreductase (mtmT1). The involvement of this gene cluster in Mtm biosynthesis was demonstrated by the Mtm non-producing phenotype of mutants generated in two independent insertional inactivation experiments.	1
Title: Molecular basis of S-layer glycoprotein glycan biosynthesis in Geobacillus stearothermophilus Abstract: The Gram-positive bacterium Geobacillus stearothermophilus NRS 2004/3a possesses a cell wall containing an oblique surface layer (S-layer) composed of glycoprotein subunits. O-Glycans with the structure [-->2)-alpha-L-Rhap-(1-->3)-beta-L-Rhap-(1-->2)-alpha-L-Rhap-(1-->](n) (= 13-18), a2-O-methyl group capping the terminal repeating unit at the nonreducing end and a -->2)-alpha-L-Rhap-[(1-->3)-alpha-L-Rhap](n) (= 1-2)(1-->3)- adaptor are linked via a beta-D-Galp residue to distinct sites of the S-layer protein SgsE. S-layer glycan biosynthesis is encoded by a polycistronic slg (surface layer glycosylation) gene cluster. Four assigned glycosyltransferases named WsaC-WsaF, were investigated by a combined biochemical and NMR approach, starting from synthetic octyl-linked saccharide precursors. We demonstrate that three of the enzymes are rhamnosyltransferases that are responsible for the transfer of L-rhamnose from a dTDP-beta-L-Rha precursor to the nascent S-layer glycan, catalyzing the formation of the alpha1,3- (WsaC and WsaD) and beta1,2-linkages (WsaF) present in the adaptor saccharide and in the repeating units of the mature S-layer glycan, respectively. These enzymes work in concert with a multifunctional methylrhamnosyltransferase (WsaE). The N-terminal portion of WsaE is responsible for the S-adenosylmethionine-dependent methylation reaction of the terminal alpha1,3-linked L-rhamnose residue, and the central and C-terminal portions are involved in the transfer of L-rhamnose from dTDP-beta-L-rhamnose to the adaptor saccharide to form the alpha1,2- and alpha1,3-linkages during S-layer glycan chain elongation, with the methylation and the glycosylation reactions occurring independently. Characterization of these enzymes thus reveals the complete molecular basis for S-layer glycan biosynthesis.	1
Title: Multiple regulatory events in the development of competence for genetic transformation in Haemophilus influenzae Abstract: Cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate derepresses enzyme synthesis but does not yield high levels of transformability or detectable levels of competence-related envelope polypeptides. Additional regulatory events must trigger complete expression of competence.	0
Title: The structure, function, and origin of the microcin H47 ATP-binding cassette exporter indicate its relatedness to that of colicin V Abstract: Microcin H47, a gene-encoded peptide antibiotic produced by a natural Escherichia coli strain, was shown to be secreted by a three-component ATP-binding cassette exporter which was revealed to be strongly related to that of colicin V. The results of sequence and gene fusion analyses, as well as heterologous complementation assays, are presented.	1
Title: Polyketide assembly lines of uncultivated sponge symbionts from structure-based gene targeting Abstract: There is increasing evidence that uncultivated bacterial symbionts are the true producers of numerous bioactive compounds isolated from marine sponges. The localization and heterologous expression of biosynthetic genes could clarify this issue and provide sustainable supplies for a wide range of pharmaceuticals. However, identification of genes in the usually highly complex symbiont communities remains a challenging task. For polyketides, one of the most important groups of sponge-derived drug candidates, we have developed a general strategy that allows one to rapidly access biosynthetic gene clusters based on chemical moieties. Using this method, we targeted polyketide synthase genes from two different sponge metagenomes. We have obtained from a sponge-bacterial association a complete pathway for the rare and potent antitumor agent psymberin from Psammocinia aff. bulbosa. The data support the symbiont hypothesis and provide insights into natural product evolution in previously inaccessible bacteria.	1
Title: Crystal structures of phosphite dehydrogenase provide insights into nicotinamide cofactor regeneration Abstract: The enzyme phosphite dehydrogenase (PTDH) catalyzes the NAD(+)-dependent conversion of phosphite to phosphate and represents the first biological catalyst that has been shown to conduct the enzymatic oxidation of phosphorus. Despite investigation for more than a decade into both the mechanism of its unusual reaction and its utility in cofactor regeneration, there has been a lack of any structural data for PTDH. Here we present the cocrystal structure of an engineered thermostable variant of PTDH bound to NAD(+) (1.7 Å resolution), as well as four other cocrystal structures of thermostable PTDH and its variants with different ligands (all between 1.85 and 2.3 Å resolution). These structures provide a molecular framework for understanding prior mutational analysis and point to additional residues, located in the active site, that may contribute to the enzymatic activity of this highly unusual catalyst.	0
Title: In Vitro Biosynthesis of the Nonproteinogenic Amino Acid Methoxyvinylglycine Abstract: Oxyvinylglycines are a family of nonproteinogenic amino acids featuring an essential vinyl ether conferring mechanism-based inhibition of pyridoxal phosphate enzymes. The gene clusters for a few oxyvinylglycines are known, yet the biosynthetic origin of the vinyl ether is elusive. The in vitro biosynthesis of methoxyvinylglycine or l-2-amino-4-methoxy-trans-3-butenoic acid (AMB) is reported. It is shown that AMB is made from glutamate as an alanyl-AMB dipeptide and the rationale is provided for the N-term Ala. Using a chemical capture method, the order and timing of the modifications on non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS)-bound substrates was determined, including a cryptic hydroxylation of the Glu β-carbon. Eliminating this hydroxy group likely generates a key α,β-dehydroamino acid intermediate that facilitates decarboxylation. This work sheds light on vinyl ether biosynthesis and uncovers new NRPS chemistry.	1
Title: Thermoset Shape-Memory Polyurethane with Intrinsic Plasticity Enabled by Transcarbamoylation Abstract: Thermoset polymers are known for their superior thermomechanical properties, but the chemical crosslinking typically leads to intractability. This is reflected in the great differences between thermoset and thermoplastic shape-memory polymers; the former exhibit a robust shape memory but are not capable of redefining the permanent shape. Contrary to current knowledge, we reveal here that a classical thermoset shape-memory polyurethane is readily capable of permanent reshaping (plasticity) after a topological network rearrangement that is induced by transcarbamoylation. By employing the Jianzhi technique (also known as kirigami), unexpected shape-shifting versatility was observed for this otherwise classical material. As the essential carbamate moiety in polyurethanes is one of the most common polymer building units, we anticipate that our finding will have significant benefits beyond shape shifting.	0
Title: The potential of mineral weathering of halophilic-endophytic bacteria isolated from Suaeda salsa and Spartina anglica Abstract: Bacteria have the abilities of salt tolerant, mineral weathering and plant growth promoting can promote the growth of plants in saline lands. However, few reports of the mineral weathering capacity of halophilic-endophytic bacteria, raising the question of whether the halophilic-endophytic weathering bacteria are fundamentally distinct from those in plants communities. In this study, we isolated and characterized halophilic bacterial strains from the roots and leaves of Suaeda salsa and Spartina anglica with respect to their mineral weathering pattern, role in the promoting plant growth, community structure, and their changes in these two plants. Using improved Gibbson medium, we obtained 156 halophilic bacterial strains, among which 92 and 64 strains were isolated from the S. salsa and S. anglica samples, respectively. The rock weathering patterns of the isolates were characterized using batch cultures that measure the quantity of Si, Al, K, and Fe released from crystal biotite under aerobic conditions. Significantly, the biomass and capacity of the mineral weathering of the halophilic-endophytic bacteria were different in the plants. The abundance of the halophilic-endophytic bacterials in the Suaeda salsa was significantly greater than Spartina anglica, whereas the mineral weathering bacterial in the Suaeda salsa was similar to the Spartina anglica. Furthermore, the proportion of plant growth-promoting bacteria in the Suaeda salsa was higher than Spartina anglica. Phylogenetic analyses show that the weathered minerals were inhabited by specific functional groups of bacteria (Halomonas, Acinetobacter, Burkholderia, Alcaligenes, Sphingobium, Arthrobacter, Chryseobacterium, Paenibacillus, Microbacterium, Ensifer, Ralstonia and Enterobacter) that contribute to the mineral weathering. The changes in halophilic endophytes weathering communities between the two plants were attributable not only to major bacterial groups but also to a change in the minor population structure.	0
Title: Insights into the biosynthesis of the benzoquinone ansamycins geldanamycin and herbimycin, obtained by gene sequencing and disruption Abstract: Geldanamycin and the closely related herbimycins A, B, and C were the first benzoquinone ansamycins to be extensively studied for their antitumor properties as small-molecule inhibitors of the Hsp90 protein chaperone complex. These compounds are produced by two different Streptomyces hygroscopicus strains and have the same modular polyketide synthase (PKS)-derived carbon skeleton but different substitution patterns at C-11, C-15, and C-17. To set the stage for structural modification by genetic engineering, we previously identified the gene cluster responsible for geldanamycin biosynthesis. We have now cloned and sequenced a 115-kb segment of the herbimycin biosynthetic gene cluster from S. hygroscopicus AM 3672, including the genes for the PKS and most of the post-PKS tailoring enzymes. The similarities and differences between the gene clusters and biosynthetic pathways for these closely related ansamycins are interpreted with support from the results of gene inactivation experiments. In addition, the organization and functions of genes involved in the biosynthesis of the 3-amino-5-hydroxybenzoic acid (AHBA) starter unit and the post-PKS modifications of progeldanamycin were assessed by inactivating the subclusters of AHBA biosynthetic genes and two oxygenase genes (gdmM and gdmL) that were proposed to be involved in formation of the geldanamycin benzoquinoid system. A resulting novel geldanamycin analog, KOS-1806, was isolated and characterized.	1
Title: Nonribosomal peptide synthetase with a unique iterative-alternative-optional mechanism catalyzes amonabactin synthesis in Aeromonas Abstract: Based on the exploration of data generated by genome sequencing, a bioinformatics approach has been chosen to identify the biosynthetic pathway of the siderophores produced by Aeromonas species. The amonabactins, considered as a virulence factor, represent a family of four variants of catechol peptidic siderophores containing Dhb, Lys, Gly, and an aromatic residue either Trp or Phe in a D-configuration. The synthesis operon is constituted of seven genes named amoCEBFAGH and is iron-regulated. The cluster includes genes encoding proteins involved in the synthesis and incorporation of the Dhb monomer, and genes encoding specific nonribosomal peptide synthetases, which are responsible for the building of the peptidic moiety. The amonabactin assembly line displays a still so far not described atypical mode of synthesis that is iterative, alternative, and optional. A disruption mutant in the adenylation domain of AmoG was unable to synthesize any amonabactin and to grow in iron stress conditions while a deletion of amoH resulted in the production of only two over the four forms. The amo cluster is widespread among most of the Aeromonas species, only few species produces the enterobactin siderophore.	1
Title: Identification and analysis of the biosynthetic gene cluster encoding the thiopeptide antibiotic cyclothiazomycin in Streptomyces hygroscopicus 10-22 Abstract: Thiopeptide antibiotics are an important class of natural products resulting from posttranslational modifications of ribosomally synthesized peptides. Cyclothiazomycin is a typical thiopeptide antibiotic that has a unique bridged macrocyclic structure derived from an 18-amino-acid structural peptide. Here we reported cloning, sequencing, and heterologous expression of the cyclothiazomycin biosynthetic gene cluster from Streptomyces hygroscopicus 10-22. Remarkably, successful heterologous expression of a 22.7-kb gene cluster in Streptomyces lividans 1326 suggested that there is a minimum set of 15 open reading frames that includes all of the functional genes required for cyclothiazomycin production. Six genes of these genes, cltBCDEFG flanking the structural gene cltA, were predicted to encode the enzymes required for the main framework of cyclothiazomycin, and two enzymes encoded by a putative operon, cltMN, were hypothesized to participate in the tailoring step to generate the tertiary thioether, leading to the final cyclization of the bridged macrocyclic structure. This rigorous bioinformatics analysis based on heterologous expression of cyclothiazomycin resulted in an ideal biosynthetic model for us to understand the biosynthesis of thiopeptides.	1
Title: Granular layer in the periplasmic space of gram-positive bacteria and fine structures of Enterococcus gallinarum and Streptococcus gordonii septa revealed by cryo-electron microscopy of vitreous sections Abstract: High-resolution structural information on optimally preserved bacterial cells can be obtained with cryo-electron microscopy of vitreous sections. With the help of this technique, the existence of a periplasmic space between the plasma membrane and the thick peptidoglycan layer of the gram-positive bacteria Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus was recently shown. This raises questions about the mode of polymerization of peptidoglycan. In the present study, we report the structure of the cell envelope of three gram-positive bacteria (B. subtilis, Streptococcus gordonii, and Enterococcus gallinarum). In the three cases, a previously undescribed granular layer adjacent to the plasma membrane is found in the periplasmic space. In order to better understand how nascent peptidoglycan is incorporated into the mature peptidoglycan, we investigated cellular regions known to represent the sites of cell wall production. Each of these sites possesses a specific structure. We propose a hypothetic model of peptidoglycan polymerization that accommodates these differences: peptidoglycan precursors could be exported from the cytoplasm to the periplasmic space, where they could diffuse until they would interact with the interface between the granular layer and the thick peptidoglycan layer. They could then polymerize with mature peptidoglycan. We report cytoplasmic structures at the E. gallinarum septum that could be interpreted as cytoskeletal elements driving cell division (FtsZ ring). Although immunoelectron microscopy and fluorescence microscopy studies have demonstrated the septal and cytoplasmic localization of FtsZ, direct visualization of in situ FtsZ filaments has not been obtained in any electron microscopy study of fixed and dehydrated bacteria.	0
Title: Mammalian target of Rapamycin inhibition and mycobacterial survival are uncoupled in murine macrophages Abstract: Background:                       Autophagy is a cellular response to intracellular pathogens including mycobacteria and is induced by the direct inhibitors of mammalian target of Rapamycin (mTOR), a major negative regulator of autophagy. Autophagy induction by mTOR inhibition (mTOR dependent autophagy), through chemical means or starvation, leads to mycobacterial killing in infected cells. However, previous work by our group has shown that mycobacterial infection of macrophages naturally induces both autophagy and mammalian target of Rapamycin (mTOR) activity (mTOR independent autophagy). In the current work, we further explore the relationship between mTOR activity and mycobacterial killing in macrophages.                  Results:                       While low concentrations of the mTOR inhibitors, Rapamycin, Torin 1, and Torin 2, can effectively reduce or block mTOR activity in response to lipopolysaccharides (LPS) or mycobacteria, higher concentrations (10 uM) are required to observe Mycobacterium smegmatis killing. The growth of M. smegmatis was also inhibited by high concentrations of Rapamycin in LC3B and ATG5 deficient bone marrow derived macrophages, suggesting that non-autophagic mechanisms might contribute to killing at high doses. Since mycobacterial killing could be observed only at fairly high concentrations of the mTOR inhibitors, exceeding doses necessary to inhibit mTOR, we hypothesized that high doses of Rapamycin, the most commonly utilized mTOR inhibitor for inducing autophagic killing, may exert a direct bactericidal effect on the mycobacteria. Although a short-term treatment of mycobacteria with Rapamycin did not substantially affect mycobacterial growth, a long-term exposure to Rapamycin could impact mycobacterial growth in vitro in select species.                  Conclusions:                       This data, coupled with previous work from our laboratory, further indicates that autophagy induction by mTOR inhibition is an artificial means to increase mycobacterial killing and masks more relevant endogenous autophagic biochemistry that needs to be understood.	0
Title: Rational generation of lasso peptides based on biosynthetic gene mutations and site-selective chemical modifications Abstract: Lasso peptides are a unique family of natural products whose structures feature a specific threaded fold, which confers these peptides the resistance to thermal and proteolytic degradation. This stability gives lasso peptides excellent pharmacokinetic properties, which together with their diverse reported bioactivities have garnered extensive attention because of their drug development potential. Notably, the threaded fold has proven quite inaccessible by chemical synthesis, which has hindered efficient generation of structurally diverse lasso peptides. We herein report the discovery of a new lasso peptide stlassin (1) by gene activation based on a Streptomyces heterologous expression system. Site-directed mutagenesis on the precursor peptide-encoding gene is carried out systematically, generating 17 stlassin derivatives (2-17 and 21) with residue-replacements at specific positions of 1. The solution NMR structures of 1, 3, 4, 14 and 16 are determined, supporting structural comparisons that ultimately enabled the rational production of disulfide bond-containing derivatives 18 and 19, whose structures do not belong to any of the four classes currently used to classify lasso peptides. Several site-selective chemical modifications are first applied on 16 and 21, efficiently generating new derivatives (20, 22-27) whose structures bear various decorations beyond the peptidyl monotonicity. The high production yields of these stlassin derivatives facilitate biological assays, which show that 1, 4, 16, 20, 21 and 24 possess antagonistic activities against the binding of lipopolysaccharides to toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). These results demonstrate proof-of-concept for the combined mutational/chemical generation of lasso peptide libraries to support drug lead development.	1
Title: Systematic Mutational Analysis of Histidine Kinase Genes in the Nosocomial Pathogen Stenotrophomonas maltophilia Identifies BfmAK System Control of Biofilm Development Abstract: The Gram-negative bacterium Stenotrophomonas maltophilialives in diverse ecological niches. As a result of its formidable capabilities of forming biofilm and its resistance to multiple antibiotic agents, the bacterium is also a nosocomial pathogen of serious threat to the health of patients whose immune systems are suppressed or compromised. Besides the histidine kinase RpfC, the two-component signal transduction system (TCS), which is the canonical regulatory machinery used by most bacterial pathogens, has never been experimentally investigated inS. maltophilia Here, we annotated 62 putative histidine kinase genes in the S. maltophilia genome and successfully obtained 51 mutants by systematical insertional inactivation. Phenotypic characterization identified a series of mutants with deficiencies in bacterial growth, swimming motility, and biofilm development. A TCS, named here BfmA-BfmK (Smlt4209-Smlt4208), was genetically confirmed to regulate biofilm formation inS. maltophilia Together with interacting partner prediction and chromatin immunoprecipitation screens, six candidate promoter regions bound by BfmA in vivo were identified. We demonstrated that, among them, BfmA acts as a transcription factor that binds directly to the promoter regions of bfmA-bfmK and Smlt0800(acoT), a gene encoding an acyl coenzyme A thioesterase that is associated with biofilm development, and positively controls their transcription. Genome-scale mutational analyses of histidine kinase genes and functional dissection of BfmK-BfmA regulation in biofilm provide genetic information to support more in-depth studies on cellular signaling inS. maltophilia, in the context of developing novel approaches to fight this important bacterial pathogen.	0
Title: Function of the outer membrane of Escherichia coli as a permeability barrier to beta-lactam antibiotics Abstract: On the basis of a simple theoretical model, the ease of penetration of beta-lactam antibiotics through the outer membrane of Escherichia coli was measured. The cell envelope was found to act as a diffusion barrier to both penicillins and cephalosporins. The validity of the model and the cooperative action of cell-bound beta-lactamase and outer membrane were further verified by comparing calculated and experimentally determined velocities of beta-lactam hydrolysis by intact cells and sonically treated cell suspensions. The results showed good correspondence at five different antibiotic concentrations. Similar conclusions could be drawn from a comparison of beta-lactam concentrations on both sides of the outer membrane, calculated from enzyme kinetic measurements and minimal inhibitory concentrations for both a beta-lactamase-producing E. coli and its enzyme-negative variant. in the case of benzylpenicillin and cephalothin, however, no correspondence was found. The joint action of several parameters determining the efficacy of penicillins and cephalosporins against beta-lactamase-producing E. coli is discussed.	0
Title: Cyclofaulknamycin with the Rare Amino Acid D-capreomycidine Isolated from a Well-Characterized Streptomyces albus Strain Abstract: Targeted genome mining is an efficient method of biosynthetic gene cluster prioritization within constantly growing genome databases. Using two capreomycidine biosynthesis genes, alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent arginine beta-hydroxylase and pyridoxal-phosphate-dependent aminotransferase, we identified two types of clusters: one type containing both genes involved in the biosynthesis of the abovementioned moiety, and other clusters including only arginine hydroxylase. Detailed analysis of one of the clusters, the flk cluster from Streptomyces albus, led to the identification of a cyclic peptide that contains a rare D-capreomycidine moiety for the first time. The absence of the pyridoxal-phosphate-dependent aminotransferase gene in the flk cluster is compensated by the XNR_1347 gene in the S. albus genome, whose product is responsible for biosynthesis of the abovementioned nonproteinogenic amino acid. Herein, we report the structure of cyclofaulknamycin and the characteristics of its biosynthetic gene cluster, biosynthesis and bioactivity profile.	1
Title: Application of a simulation model to the prognosis of material loss in wood processing Abstract: The article discusses the influence of a sample size on the credibility of a simulation model created for the estimation of material loss in the production of a middle layer of a wooden floorboard. The study was conducted in a production company operating in the wood processing industry. Geometric characteristics of input material were captured and used to derive statistical distributions, which were then included in the simulation model. The conducted experiments indicated that the quality of the simulation model was significantly affected by the quality and quantity of the sample, on the basis of which the stochastic model is estimated. It was shown that small sample for wood processing data was insufficient to capture process variability. On the other hand, excessive sample size (80 or more observations) for the material with high natural geometric variability, involves taking into account outliers, which may lower the overall prognostic quality of the simulation model. Based on the conducted simulation experiments, the recommended sample size which allows development of a reliable model for estimation of material loss in the analyzed manufacturing process, ranges from 40 to 60 measurements.	0
Title: How Phosphorylation and ATPase Activity Regulate Anion Flux though the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR) Abstract: The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR, ABCC7), mutations of which cause cystic fibrosis, belongs to the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter family and works as a channel for small anions, such as chloride and bicarbonate. Anion channel activity is known to depend on phosphorylation by cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) and CFTR-ATPase activity. Whereas anion channel activity has been extensively investigated, phosphorylation and CFTR-ATPase activity are still poorly understood. Here, we show that the two processes can be measured in a label-free and non-invasive manner in real time in live cells, stably transfected with CFTR. This study reveals three key findings. (i) The major contribution (≥90%) to the total CFTR-related ATP hydrolysis rate is due to phosphorylation by PKA and the minor contribution (≤10%) to CFTR-ATPase activity. (ii) The mutant CFTR-E1371S that is still conductive, but defective in ATP hydrolysis, is not phosphorylated, suggesting that phosphorylation requires a functional nucleotide binding domain and occurs in the post-hydrolysis transition state. (iii) CFTR-ATPase activity is inversely related to CFTR anion flux. The present data are consistent with a model in which CFTR is in a closed conformation with two ATPs bound. The open conformation is induced by ATP hydrolysis and corresponds to the post-hydrolysis transition state that is stabilized by phosphorylation and binding of chloride channel potentiators.	0
Title: Isolation and characterization of transposon Tn5-induced mutants of Pseudomonas perfectomarina defective in nitrous oxide respiration Abstract: Transposon (Tn5) mutagenesis of Pseudomonas perfectomarina with the plasmid pSUP2021 [(pBR325-Mob(RP4))::Tn5] and the chromosomally integrated RP4 plasmid in Escherichia coli as the donor, produced three distinct groups of mutants that were defective in nitrous oxide respiration. One group of mutants lacked the structural protein of N2O reductase, the second synthesized a copper-free apoprotein; and a third group expressed a low level of intact enzyme. The mutants provided evidence for N2O being the immediate precursor of dinitrogen in denitrification and documented the essentiality of the copper enzyme. Synthesis of N2O reductase depended strongly on the growth conditions, with N2O-grown cells expressing the lowest level of enzyme. Regulatory responses of mutants elicited by nitrate or oxygen were unaltered when compared with wild-type behavior.	0
Title: One-pot multienzyme (OPME) systems for chemoenzymatic synthesis of carbohydrates Abstract: Glycosyltransferase-catalyzed enzymatic and chemoenzymatic syntheses are powerful approaches for the production of oligosaccharides, polysaccharides, glycoconjugates, and their derivatives. Enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of sugar nucleotide donors can be combined with glycosyltransferases in one pot for efficient production of the target glycans from simple monosaccharides and acceptors. The identification of enzymes involved in the salvage pathway of sugar nucleotide generation has greatly facilitated the development of simplified and efficient one-pot multienzyme (OPME) systems for synthesizing major glycan epitopes in mammalian glycomes. The applications of OPME methods are steadily gaining popularity mainly due to the increasing availability of wild-type and engineered enzymes. Substrate promiscuity of these enzymes and their mutants allows OPME synthesis of carbohydrates with naturally occurring post-glycosylational modifications (PGMs) and their non-natural derivatives using modified monosaccharides as precursors. The OPME systems can be applied in sequence for synthesizing complex carbohydrates. The sequence of the sequential OPME processes, the glycosyltransferase used, and the substrate specificities of the glycosyltransferases define the structures of the products. The OPME and sequential OPME strategies can be extended to diverse glycans in other glycomes when suitable enzymes with substrate promiscuity become available. This Perspective summarizes the work of the authors and collaborators on the development of glycosyltransferase-based OPME systems for carbohydrate synthesis. Future directions are also discussed.	0
Title: Investigation on the Evolution of Shiga Toxin-Converting Phages Based on Whole Genome Sequencing Abstract: Bacteriophages are pivotal elements in the dissemination of virulence genes. The main virulence determinants of Shiga Toxin producing E. coli, Shiga Toxins (Stx), are encoded by genes localized in the genome of lambdoid bacteriophages. Stx comprise two antigenically different types, Stx1 and Stx2, further divided into subtypes. Among these, certain Stx2 subtypes appear to be more commonly occurring in the most severe forms of the STEC disease, haemorrhagic colitis and haemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). This study aimed at obtaining insights on the evolution of Stx2 bacteriophages, due to their relevance in public health, and we report here on the analysis of the genomic structure of Stx2 converting phages in relation with the known reservoir of the E. coli strains harboring them. Stx2-converting phages conveying the genes encoding different stx2 subtypes have been isolated from STEC strains and their whole genomes have been sequenced, analyzed and compared to those of other Stx2 phages available in the public domain. The phages' regions containing the stx2 genes have been analyzed in depth allowing to make inference on the possible mechanisms of selection and maintenance of certain Stx2 phages in the reservoir. The "stx regions" of different stx2 gene subtypes grouped into three different evolutionary lines in the comparative analysis, reflecting the frequency with which these subtypes are found in different animal niches, suggesting that the colonization of specific reservoir by STEC strains could be influenced by the Stx phage that they carry. Noteworthy, we could identify the presence of nanS-p gene exclusively in the "stx regions" of the phages identified in STEC strains commonly found in cattle. As a matter of fact, this gene encodes an esterase capable of metabolizing sialic acids produced by submaxillary glands of bovines and present in great quantities in their gastrointestinal tract.	0
Title: Characterization of microbial communities in gas industry pipelines Abstract: Culture-independent techniques, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis, and random cloning of 16S rRNA gene sequences amplified from community DNA were used to determine the diversity of microbial communities in gas industry pipelines. Samples obtained from natural gas pipelines were used directly for DNA extraction, inoculated into sulfate-reducing bacterium medium, or used to inoculate a reactor that simulated a natural gas pipeline environment. The variable V2-V3 (average size, 384 bp) and V3-V6 (average size, 648 bp) regions of bacterial and archaeal 16S rRNA genes, respectively, were amplified from genomic DNA isolated from nine natural gas pipeline samples and analyzed. A total of 106 bacterial 16S rDNA sequences were derived from DGGE bands, and these formed three major clusters: beta and gamma subdivisions of Proteobacteria and gram-positive bacteria. The most frequently encountered bacterial species was Comamonas denitrificans, which was not previously reported to be associated with microbial communities found in gas pipelines or with microbially influenced corrosion. The 31 archaeal 16S rDNA sequences obtained in this study were all related to those of methanogens and phylogenetically fall into three clusters: order I, Methanobacteriales; order III, Methanomicrobiales; and order IV, Methanosarcinales: Further microbial ecology studies are needed to better understand the relationship among bacterial and archaeal groups and the involvement of these groups in the process of microbially influenced corrosion in order to develop improved ways of monitoring and controlling microbially influenced corrosion.	0
Title: Surface Plasmon Resonance Microscopy: From Single-Molecule Sensing to Single-Cell Imaging Abstract: Surface plasmon resonance microscopy (SPRM) is a versatile platform for chemical and biological sensing and imaging. Great progress in exploring its applications, ranging from single-molecule sensing to single-cell imaging, has been made. In this Minireview, we introduce the principles and instrumentation of SPRM. We also summarize the broad and exciting applications of SPRM to the analysis of single entities. Finally, we discuss the challenges and limitations associated with SPRM and potential solutions.	0
Title: Lomaiviticin biosynthesis employs a new strategy for starter unit generation Abstract: Lomaiviticin biosynthesis is thought to utilize a propionyl starter unit for a type II polyketide synthase (PKS). Discovery of the lomaiviticin (lom) biosynthetic gene cluster suggested an unusual method for starter unit generation involving a bifunctional acyltransferase/decarboxylase (AT/DC) thus far observed only in type I PKS pathways. In vitro biochemical characterization of AT/DC Lom62 confirmed its ability to generate a propionyl-acyl carrier protein (ACP), revealing a new role for this enzymatic activity within natural product biosynthesis.	1
Title: Transposon Tn917lacZ mutagenesis of Bacillus subtilis: identification of two new loci required for motility and chemotaxis Abstract: We have used Tn917lacZ to mutagenize the Bacillus subtilis chromosome and have isolated mutants that are defective in chemotaxis and motility. Mapping of the transposon inserts identified two new loci. Mutations in one of these loci generated mutants that had paralyzed flagella. Accordingly, we designate this a mot locus. The other locus is closely linked to the first and encodes proteins specifying chemotaxis functions. This locus is designated the cheX locus. Both the mot and cheX loci map close to ptsI. An additional transposon insert that maps in the hag locus was obtained. The pattern of beta-galactosidase expression from some of the transposons suggested that the mot locus is regulated by sigD, a minor sigma factor of B. subtilis. The cheX locus appeared to be under the control of vegetative sigA. Four transposon inserts were mapped to a previously characterized che locus near spcB. These mutants did not produce flagellin and were defective in the methylation of the methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins. This locus probably encodes proteins required for flagellum biosynthesis and other proteins that are required for the methylation response.	0
Title: A whole-genome shotgun optical map of Yersinia pestis strain KIM Abstract: Yersinia pestis is the causative agent of the bubonic, septicemic, and pneumonic plagues (also known as black death) and has been responsible for recurrent devastating pandemics throughout history. To further understand this virulent bacterium and to accelerate an ongoing sequencing project, two whole-genome restriction maps (XhoI and PvuII) of Y. pestis strain KIM were constructed using shotgun optical mapping. This approach constructs ordered restriction maps from randomly sheared individual DNA molecules directly extracted from cells. The two maps served different purposes; the XhoI map facilitated sequence assembly by providing a scaffold for high-resolution alignment, while the PvuII map verified genome sequence assembly. Our results show that such maps facilitated the closure of sequence gaps and, most importantly, provided a purely independent means for sequence validation. Given the recent advancements to the optical mapping system, increased resolution and throughput are enabling such maps to guide sequence assembly at a very early stage of a microbial sequencing project.	0
Title: Biosynthesis and transcriptional analysis of thurincin H, a tandem repeated bacteriocin genetic locus, produced by Bacillus thuringiensis SF361 Abstract: Thurincin H, a bacteriocin produced by Bacillus thuringiensis SF361 isolated from honey, strongly inhibited the growth of Bacillus cereus F4552. The bacteriocin was purified by 65% ammonium sulfate precipitation of the culture supernatant, followed by octyl-sepharose CL-4B and reverse-phase HPLC. The molecular mass of the bacteriocin was determined to be 3139.51 Da and the 14 amino acids of the bacteriocin at the N-terminus were identified. The complete amino acid sequence of mature thurincin H was deduced from three structural genes, thnA1, thnA2, and thnA3 found in tandem repeats on the chromosome, all of which encode for the same bacteriocin, thurincin H. The genetic determinants for thurincin H biosynthesis consist of 10 ORFs, including three thurincin H structural genes. Northern hybridization elucidated that the transcription of all three bacteriocin structural genes was regulated by a putative promoter located upstream of thnA1.	1
Title: Design and synthesis of chiral and regenerable [2.2]paracyclophane-based NAD(P)H models and application in biomimetic reduction of flavonoids Abstract: With the rapid development of biomimetic asymmetric reduction, the demand for efficient chiral and regenerable NAD(P)H models is growing rapidly. Herein, a new class of [2.2]paracyclophane-based chiral and regenerable NAD(P)H models (CYNAMs) was designed and synthesized. The first enantioselective biomimetic reduction of tetrasubstituted alkene flavonoids has been successfully realized through enzyme-like cooperative bifunctional activation, giving chiral flavanones with up to 99% yield and 99% ee.	0
Title: Identification of a Polyketide Synthase Involved in Sorbicillin Biosynthesis by Penicillium chrysogenum Abstract: Secondary metabolism in Penicillium chrysogenum was intensively subjected to classical strain improvement (CSI), the resulting industrial strains producing high levels of β-lactams. During this process, the production of yellow pigments, including sorbicillinoids, was eliminated as part of a strategy to enable the rapid purification of β-lactams. Here we report the identification of the polyketide synthase (PKS) gene essential for sorbicillinoid biosynthesis in P. chrysogenum We demonstrate that the production of polyketide precursors like sorbicillinol and dihydrosorbicillinol as well as their derivatives bisorbicillinoids requires the function of a highly reducing PKS encoded by the gene Pc21g05080 (pks13). This gene belongs to the cluster that was mutated and transcriptionally silenced during the strain improvement program. Using an improved β-lactam-producing strain, repair of the mutation in pks13 led to the restoration of sorbicillinoid production. This now enables genetic studies on the mechanism of sorbicillinoid biosynthesis in P. chrysogenum and opens new perspectives for pathway engineering.                  Importance:                       Sorbicillinoids are secondary metabolites with antiviral, anti-inflammatory, and antimicrobial activities produced by filamentous fungi. This study identified the gene cluster responsible for sorbicillinoid formation in Penicillium chrysogenum, which now allows engineering of this diverse group of compounds.	1
Title: Genomics-driven discovery of the pneumocandin biosynthetic gene cluster in the fungus Glarea lozoyensis Abstract: Background:                       The antifungal therapy caspofungin is a semi-synthetic derivative of pneumocandin B0, a lipohexapeptide produced by the fungus Glarea lozoyensis, and was the first member of the echinocandin class approved for human therapy. The nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS)-polyketide synthases (PKS) gene cluster responsible for pneumocandin biosynthesis from G. lozoyensis has not been elucidated to date. In this study, we report the elucidation of the pneumocandin biosynthetic gene cluster by whole genome sequencing of the G. lozoyensis wild-type strain ATCC 20868.                  Results:                       The pneumocandin biosynthetic gene cluster contains a NRPS (GLNRPS4) and a PKS (GLPKS4) arranged in tandem, two cytochrome P450 monooxygenases, seven other modifying enzymes, and genes for L-homotyrosine biosynthesis, a component of the peptide core. Thus, the pneumocandin biosynthetic gene cluster is significantly more autonomous and organized than that of the recently characterized echinocandin B gene cluster. Disruption mutants of GLNRPS4 and GLPKS4 no longer produced the pneumocandins (A0 and B0), and the Δglnrps4 and Δglpks4 mutants lost antifungal activity against the human pathogenic fungus Candida albicans. In addition to pneumocandins, the G. lozoyensis genome encodes a rich repertoire of natural product-encoding genes including 24 PKSs, six NRPSs, five PKS-NRPS hybrids, two dimethylallyl tryptophan synthases, and 14 terpene synthases.                  Conclusions:                       Characterization of the gene cluster provides a blueprint for engineering new pneumocandin derivatives with improved pharmacological properties. Whole genome estimation of the secondary metabolite-encoding genes from G. lozoyensis provides yet another example of the huge potential for drug discovery from natural products from the fungal kingdom.	1
Title: Discovery and characterization of a group of fungal polycyclic polyketide prenyltransferases Abstract: The prenyltransferase (PTase) gene vrtC was proposed to be involved in viridicatumtoxin (1) biosynthesis in Penicillium aethiopicum. Targeted gene deletion and reconstitution of recombinant VrtC activity in vitro established that VrtC is a geranyl transferase that catalyzes a regiospecific Friedel-Crafts alkylation of the naphthacenedione carboxamide intermediate 2 at carbon 6 with geranyl diphosphate. VrtC can function in the absence of divalent ions and can utilize similar naphthacenedione substrates, such as the acetyl-primed TAN-1612 (4). Genome mining using the VrtC protein sequence leads to the identification of a homologous group of PTase genes in the genomes of human and animal-associated fungi. Three enzymes encoded by this new subgroup of PTase genes from Neosartorya fischeri, Microsporum canis, and Trichophyton tonsurans were shown to be able to catalyze transfer of dimethylallyl to several tetracyclic naphthacenedione substrates in vitro. In total, seven C(5)- or C(10)-prenylated naphthacenedione compounds were generated. The regioselectivity of these new polycyclic PTases (pcPTases) was confirmed by characterization of product 9 obtained from biotransformation of 4 in Escherichia coli expressing the N. fischeri pcPTase gene. The discovery of this new subgroup of PTases extends our enzymatic tools for modifying polycyclic compounds and enables genome mining of new prenylated polyketides.	1
Title: Structural and kinetic analysis of prolyl-isomerization/phosphorylation cross-talk in the CTD code Abstract: The C-terminal domain (CTD) of eukaryotic RNA polymerase II is an essential regulator for RNA polymerase II-mediated transcription. It is composed of multiple repeats of a consensus sequence Tyr(1)Ser(2)Pro(3)Thr(4)Ser(5)Pro(6)Ser(7). CTD regulation of transcription is mediated by both phosphorylation of the serines and prolyl isomerization of the two prolines. Interestingly, the phosphorylation sites are typically close to prolines, and thus the conformation of the adjacent proline could impact the specificity of the corresponding kinases and phosphatases. Experimental evidence of cross-talk between these two regulatory mechanisms has been elusive. Pin1 is a highly conserved phosphorylation-specific peptidyl-prolyl isomerase (PPIase) that recognizes the phospho-Ser/Thr (pSer/Thr)-Pro motif with CTD as one of its primary substrates in vivo. In the present study, we provide structural snapshots and kinetic evidence that support the concept of cross-talk between prolyl isomerization and phosphorylation. We determined the structures of Pin1 bound with two substrate isosteres that mimic peptides containing pSer/Thr-Pro motifs in cis or trans conformations. The results unequivocally demonstrate the utility of both cis- and trans-locked alkene isosteres as close geometric mimics of peptides bound to a protein target. Building on this result, we identified a specific case in which Pin1 differentially affects the rate of dephosphorylation catalyzed by two phosphatases (Scp1 and Ssu72) that target the same serine residue in the CTD heptad repeat but have different preferences for the isomerization state of the adjacent proline residue. These data exemplify for the first time how modulation of proline isomerization can kinetically impact signal transduction in transcription regulation.	0
Title: A molecular platinum cluster junction: a single-molecule switch Abstract: We present a theoretical study of electron transport through single-molecule junctions incorporating a Pt(6) metal cluster bound within an organic framework. The insertion of this molecule between a pair of electrodes leads to a fully atomically engineered nanometallic device with high conductance at the Fermi level and two sequential high on/off switching states. The origin of this property can be traced back to the existence of a degenerate HOMO consisting of two asymmetric orbitals with energies close to the Fermi level of the metal leads. The degeneracy is broken when the molecule is contacted to the leads, giving rise to two resonances that become pinned to the Fermi level and display destructive interference.	0
Title: Elucidation of the biosynthesis of the methane catalyst coenzyme F430 Abstract: Methane biogenesis in methanogens is mediated by methyl-coenzyme M reductase, an enzyme that is also responsible for the utilization of methane through anaerobic methane oxidation. The enzyme uses an ancillary factor called coenzyme F430, a nickel-containing modified tetrapyrrole that promotes catalysis through a methyl radical/Ni(ii)-thiolate intermediate. However, it is unclear how coenzyme F430 is synthesized from the common primogenitor uroporphyrinogen iii, incorporating 11 steric centres into the macrocycle, although the pathway must involve chelation, amidation, macrocyclic ring reduction, lactamization and carbocyclic ring formation. Here we identify the proteins that catalyse the biosynthesis of coenzyme F430 from sirohydrochlorin, termed CfbA-CfbE, and demonstrate their activity. The research completes our understanding of how the repertoire of tetrapyrrole-based pigments are constructed, permitting the development of recombinant systems to use these metalloprosthetic groups more widely.	1
Title: Tetarimycin A, an MRSA-active antibiotic identified through induced expression of environmental DNA gene clusters Abstract: The propagation of DNA extracted directly from environmental samples in laboratory-grown bacteria provides a means to study natural products encoded in the genomes of uncultured bacteria. However, gene silencing often hampers the functional characterization of gene clusters captured on environmental DNA clones. Here we show that the overexpression of transcription factors found in sequenced environmental DNA-derived biosynthetic gene clusters, in conjunction with traditional culture-broth extract screening, can be used to identify new bioactive secondary metabolites from otherwise-silent gene clusters. Tetarimycin A, a tetracyclic methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)-active antibiotic, was isolated from the culture-broth extract of Streptomyces albus cultures cotransformed with an environmentally derived type-II polyketide biosynthetic gene cluster and its pathway-specific Streptomyces antibiotic regulatory protein (SARP) cloned under the control of the constitutive ermE* promoter.	1
Title: Restriction mapping and hybridization studies of a beta-lactamase-encoding fragment from Streptococcus (Enterococcus) faecalis Abstract: A restriction map of a 5.1-kilobase EcoRI fragment encoding an enterococcal beta-lactamase was prepared and compared with the restriction map of a cloned staphylococcal beta-lactamase gene and with the published maps of several other staphylococcal beta-lactamase genes. Comparison and hybridization studies showed that there were identical restriction sites in the region of the bla structural gene but not in the region surrounding this gene.	0
Title: Ketopremithramycins and ketomithramycins, four new aureolic acid-type compounds obtained upon inactivation of two genes involved in the biosynthesis of the deoxysugar moieties of the antitumor drug mithramycin by Streptomyces argillaceus, reveal novel insights into post-PKS tailoring steps of the mithramycin biosynthetic pathway Abstract: Mithramycin is an aureolic acid-type antimicrobial and antitumor agent produced by Streptomyces argillaceus. Modifying post-polyketide synthase (PKS) tailoring enzymes involved in the production of mithramycin is an effective way of gaining further information regarding the late steps of its biosynthetic pathway. In addition, new "unnatural" natural products of the aureolic acid-type class are likely to be produced. The role of two such post-PKS tailoring enzymes, encoded by mtmC and mtmTIII, was investigated, and four novel aureolic acid class drugs, two premithramycin-type molecules and two mithramycin derivatives, were isolated from mutant strains constructed by insertional gene inactivation of either of these two genes. From data bank comparisons, the corresponding proteins MtmC and MtmTIII were believed to act as a C-methyltransferase involved in the production of the D-mycarose (sugar E) of mithramycin and as a ketoreductase seemingly involved in the biosynthesis of the mithramycin aglycon, respectively. However, gene inactivation and analysis of the accumulated products revealed that both genes encode enzymes participating in the biosynthesis of the D-mycarose building block. Furthermore, the inactivation of MtmC seems to affect the ketoreductase responsible for 4-ketoreduction of sugar C, a D-olivose. Instead of obtaining premithramycin and mithramycin derivatives with a modified E-sugar upon inactivation of mtmC, compounds were obtained that completely lack the E-sugar moiety and that possess an unexpected 4-ketosugar moiety instead of the D-olivose at the beginning of the lower deoxysaccharide chain. The inactivation of mtmTIII led to the accumulation of 4E-ketomithramycin, showing that this ketoreductase is responsible for the 4-ketoreduction of the D-mycarose moiety. The new compounds of the mutant strains, 4A-ketopremithramycin A2, 4A-keto-9-demethylpremithramycin A2, 4C-keto-demycarosylmithramycin, and 4E-ketomithramycin, indicate surprising substrate flexibility of post-PKS enzymes of the mithramycin biosynthetic pathway. Although the glycosyltransferase responsible for the attachment of D-mycarose cannot transfer the unmethylated sugar to the existing lower disaccharide chain, it can transfer the 4-ketoform of sugar E. In addition, the glycosyltransferase MtmGIV, which is responsible for the linkage of sugar C, is also able to transfer an activated 4-ketosugar. The oxygenase MtmOIV, normally responsible for the oxidative cleavage of the tetracyclic premithramycin B into the tricyclic immediate precursor of mithramycin, can act on a substrate analogue with a modified or even incomplete trisaccharide chain. The same is true for glycosyltransferases MtmGI and MtmGII, both of which partake in the formation and attachment of the A-B disaccharide in mithramycin.	1
Title: A Phosphinate-Containing Fluorophore Capable of Selectively Inducing Apoptosis in Cancer Cells Abstract: Chemotherapeutic agents generally suffer from off-target cytotoxicity in noncancerous cell types, leading to undesired side effects. As a result, significant effort has been put into identifying compounds that are selective for cancerous over noncancerous cell types. Our laboratory has recently developed a series of near-infrared (NIR) fluorophores containing a phosphinate functionality at the bridging position of a xanthene scaffold, termed Nebraska Red (NR) fluorophores. Herein, we report the selective cytotoxicity of one NR derivative, NR744 , against HeLa (cervical cancer) cells versus NIH-3T3 (noncancerous fibroblast) cells. Mechanistic studies based on the NIR fluorescence signal of NR744 showed distinct subcellular localization in HeLa (mitochondrial) versus NIH-3T3 (lysosomal) that resulted from the elevated mitochondrial potential in HeLa cells. This study provides a new, NIR scaffold for the further development of reagents for targeted cancer therapy.	0
Title: An Outer Membrane Protein Involved in the Uptake of Glucose Is Essential for Cytophaga hutchinsonii Cellulose Utilization Abstract: Cytophaga hutchinsonii specializes in cellulose digestion by employing a collection of novel cell-associated proteins. Here, we identified a novel gene locus, CHU_1276, that is essential for C. hutchinsonii cellulose utilization. Disruption of CHU_1276 in C. hutchinsonii resulted in complete deficiency in cellulose degradation, as well as compromised assimilation of cellobiose or glucose at a low concentration. Further analysis showed that CHU_1276 was an outer membrane protein that could be induced by cellulose and low concentrations of glucose. Transcriptional profiling revealed that CHU_1276 exerted a profound effect on the genome-wide response to both glucose and Avicel and that the mutant lacking CHU_1276 displayed expression profiles very different from those of the wild-type strain under different culture conditions. Specifically, comparison of their transcriptional responses to cellulose led to the identification of a gene set potentially regulated by CHU_1276. These results suggest that CHU_1276 plays an essential role in cellulose utilization, probably by coordinating the extracellular hydrolysis of cellulose substrate with the intracellular uptake of the hydrolysis product in C. hutchinsonii.	0
Title: Cryogenic Focused Ion Beam Enables Atomic-Resolution Imaging of Local Structures in Highly Sensitive Bulk Crystals and Devices Abstract: With the development of ultralow-dose (scanning) transmission electron microscopy ((S)TEM) techniques, atomic-resolution imaging of highly sensitive nanomaterials has recently become possible. However, applying these techniques to the study of sensitive bulk materials remains challenging due to the lack of suitable specimen preparation methods. We report that cryogenic focused ion beam (cryo-FIB) can provide a solution to this challenge. We successfully extracted thin specimens from metal-organic framework (MOF) crystals and a hybrid halide perovskite single-crystal film solar cell using cryo-FIB without damaging the inherent structures. The high quality of the specimens enabled the subsequent (S)TEM and electron diffraction studies to reveal complex unknown local structures at an atomic resolution. The obtained structural information allowed us to resolve planar defects in MOF HKUST-1, three-dimensionally reconstruct a concomitant phase in MOF UiO-66, and discover a new CH3NH3PbI3 structure and locate its distribution in a single-crystal film perovskite solar cell. This proof-of-concept study demonstrates that cryo-FIB has a unique ability to handle highly sensitive materials, which can substantially expand the range of applications for electron microscopy.	0
Title: Two-Enzyme Pathway Links l-Arginine to Nitric Oxide in N-Nitroso Biosynthesis Abstract: Nitric oxide (NO) has wide-ranging roles in biology, but less is known about its role in building chemical diversity. Here we report a new route to NO from the biosynthetic pathway to the N-nitroso compound streptozocin. We show that the N-nitroso group of streptozocin comes from the biosynthetic reassembly of l-arginine, with the guanidino nitrogens forming a nitrogen-nitrogen bond. To understand this biosynthetic process, we identify the biosynthetic gene cluster of streptozocin and demonstrate that free l-arginine is N-methylated by StzE to give Nω-monomethyl-l-arginine. We show that this product is then oxidized by StzF, a nonheme iron-dependent enzyme unrelated to known nitric oxide synthases, generating a urea compound and NO. Our work implies that formation and capture of NO is the likely route to N-nitroso formation in vivo. Altogether, our work unveils a new enzyme pair for the production of NO from l-arginine and sets the stage for understanding biosynthetic routes to N-nitroso natural products.	1
Title: Catalytic asymmetric γ-alkylation of carbonyl compounds via stereoconvergent Suzuki cross-couplings Abstract: With the aid of a chiral nickel catalyst, enantioselective γ- (and δ-) alkylations of carbonyl compounds can be achieved through the coupling of γ-haloamides with alkylboranes. In addition to primary alkyl nucleophiles, for the first time for an asymmetric cross-coupling of an unactivated alkyl electrophile, an arylmetal, a boronate ester, and a secondary (cyclopropyl) alkylmetal compound are shown to couple with significant enantioselectivity. A mechanistic study indicates that cleavage of the carbon-halogen bond of the electrophile is irreversible under the conditions for asymmetric carbon-carbon bond formation.	0
Title: Temporal sequence of events during the initiation process in Escherichia coli deoxyribonucleic acid replication: roles of the dnaA and dnaC gene products and ribonucleic acid polymerase Abstract: Three thermosensitive deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) initiation mutants of Escherichia coli exposed to the restrictive temperature for one to two generations were examined for the ability to reinitiate DNA replication after returning to the permissive temperature in the presence of rifampin, chloramphenicol, or nalidixic acid. Reinitiation in the dnaA mutant was inhibited by rifampin but not by chloramphenicol, whereas renitiation was not inhibited by rifampin but not by chloramphenicol, whereas reinitiation was not inhibited in two dnaC mutants by either rifampin or chloramphenicol. To observe the rifampin inhibition, the antibiotic must be added at least 10 min before return to the permissive temperature. The rifampin inhibition of reinitiation was not observed when a rifampin-resistant ribonucleic acid ((RNA) polymerase gene was introduced into the dnaA mutant, demonstrating that RNA polymerase synthesizes one or more RNA species required for the initation of DNA replication (origin-RNA). Reinitiation at 30 degrees C was not inhibited by streptolydigin in a stretolydigin-sensitive dnaA muntant. Incubation in the presence of nalidixic acid prevented subsequent reinitiation in the dnaC28 mutant but did not inhibit reinitiation in the dnaA5 muntant. These results demonstrate that the dnaA gene product acts before or during the synthesis of an origin-RNA, RNA polymerase synthesizes this origin RNA, and the dnaC gene product is involved in a step after this RNA synthesis event. Furthermore, these results suggest that the dnaC gene product is involved in the first deoxyribounucleotide polymerization event wheareas the dnaA gene product acts prior to this event. A model is presented describing the temporal sequence of events that occur during initiation of a round of DNA replication, based on results in this and the accompanying paper.	0
Title: New Limonoids from Melia toosendan Abstract: The root bark of Melia toosendan afforded four new limonoids with a C-19/C-29 bridged acetal structure, together with two known limonoids, 12α-hydroxyamoorastatone and its 12-acetate. The new compounds were elucidated as 1-O-acetyltrichilin H and 29-O-substituted amoorastatone derivatives, named neoazedarachins A, B and D, by spectroscopic and chemical means. Their antifeedant activity was also studied.	0
Title: Response and adaptation of Escherichia coli to suppression of the amber stop codon Abstract: Some extant organisms reassign the amber stop codon to a sense codon through evolution, and suppression of the amber codon with engineered tRNAs has been exploited to expand the genetic code for incorporating non-canonical amino acids (ncAAs) in live systems. However, it is unclear how the host cells respond and adapt to such amber suppression. Herein we suppressed the amber codon in Escherichia coli with an orthogonal tRNA/synthetase pair and cultured the cells under such a pressure for about 500 generations. We discovered that E. coli quickly counteracted the suppression with transposon insertion to inactivate the orthogonal synthetase. Persistent amber suppression evading transposon inactivation led to global proteomic changes with a notable up-regulation of a previously uncharacterized protein (YdiI) for which we identified an unexpected function of expelling plasmids. These results should be valuable for understanding codon reassignment in genetic code evolution and for improving the efficiency of ncAA incorporation.	0
Title: Enzymatic production of (-)-indolactam V by LtxB, a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase Abstract: The P450 cytochrome monooxygenase gene, ltxB, was cloned and overexpressed in Escherichia coli as a 6xHis-tagged protein. The resulting recombinant LtxB was purified by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography and characterized biochemically. Purified LtxB demonstrated typical cytochrome P450 spectroscopic properties including substrate-induced transition from a low-spin (lambdamax=414 nm) to high-spin state (lambdamax=386 nm) upon incubation with N-methyl-L-valyl-L-tryptophanol. The catalytic activity of LtxB was verified by demonstrating the oxidation/cyclization of N-methyl-L-valyl-L-tryptophanol to (-)-indolactam V. LtxB shows a relaxed specificity for analogue substrates in which the valyl group is substituted for other aliphatic groups. The relaxed substrate specificity of LtxB, along with the relaxed specificity of the prenyltransferase, LtxC, allowed for the enzymatic production of a series of (-)-indolactam V and lyngbyatoxin analogues.	1
Title: Stable benzotriazole esters as mechanism-based inactivators of the severe acute respiratory syndrome 3CL protease Abstract: Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is caused by a newly emerged coronavirus that infected more than 8000 individuals and resulted in more than 800 fatalities in 2003. Currently, there is no effective treatment for this epidemic. SARS-3CL(pro) has been shown to be essential for replication and is thus a target for drug discovery. Here, a class of stable benzotriazole esters was reported as mechanism-based inactivators of 3CL(pro), and the most potent inactivator exhibited a k(inact) of 0.0011 s(-1) and a K(i) of 7.5 nM. Mechanistic investigation with kinetic and mass spectrometry analyses indicates that the active site Cys145 is acylated, and that no irreversible inactivation was observed with the use of the C145A mutant. In addition, a noncovalent, competitive inhibition became apparent by using benzotriazole ester surrogates in which the bridged ester-oxygen group is replaced with carbon.	0
Title: Importance of Marine-Derived Nutrients Supplied by Planktivorous Seabirds to High Arctic Tundra Plant Communities Abstract: We studied the relative importance of several environmental factors for tundra plant communities in five locations across Svalbard (High Arctic) that differed in geographical location, oceanographic and climatic influence, and soil characteristics. The amount of marine-derived nitrogen in the soil supplied by seabirds was locally the most important of the studied environmental factors influencing the tundra plant community. We found a strong positive correlation between δ15N isotopic values and total N content in the soil, confirming the fundamental role of marine-derived matter to the generally nutrient-poor Arctic tundra ecosystem. We also recorded a strong correlation between the δ15N values of soil and of the tissues of vascular plants and mosses, but not of lichens. The relationship between soil δ15N values and vascular plant cover was linear. In the case of mosses, the percentage ground cover reached maximum around a soil δ 15N value of 8‰, as did plant community diversity. This soil δ15N value clearly separated the occurrence of plants with low nitrogen tolerance (e.g. Salix polaris) from those predominating on high N content soils (e.g. Cerastium arcticum, Poa alpina). Large colonies of planktivorous little auks have a great influence on Arctic tundra vegetation, either through enhancing plant abundance or in shaping plant community composition at a local scale.	0
Title: The acarbose-biosynthetic enzyme AcbO from Actinoplanes sp. SE 50/110 is a 2-epi-5-epi-valiolone-7-phosphate 2-epimerase Abstract: The C7-cyclitol 2-epi-5-epi-valiolone is the first precursor of the cyclitol moiety of the alpha-glucosidase inhibitor acarbose in Actinoplanes sp. SE50. The 2-epi-5-epi-valiolone becomes phosphorylated at C7 by the ATP dependent kinase AcbM prior to the next modifications. Preliminary data gave evidences that the AcbO protein could catalyse the first modification step of 2-epi-5-epi-valiolone-7-phosphate. Therefore, the AcbO protein, the encoding gene of which is also part of the acbKMLNOC operon, was overproduced and purified. Indeed the purified protein catalysed the 2-epimerisation of 2-epi-5-epi-valiolone-7-phosphate. The chemical structure of the purified reaction product was proven by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy to be 5-epi-valiolone-7-phosphate.	1
Title: Competitive activity-based protein profiling identifies aza-β-lactams as a versatile chemotype for serine hydrolase inhibition Abstract: Serine hydrolases are one of the largest and most diverse enzyme classes in Nature. Most serine hydrolases lack selective inhibitors, which are valuable probes for assigning functions to these enzymes. We recently discovered a set of aza-β-lactams (ABLs) that act as potent and selective inhibitors of the mammalian serine hydrolase protein-phosphatase methylesterase-1 (PME-1). The ABLs inactivate PME-1 by covalent acylation of the enzyme's serine nucleophile, suggesting that they could offer a general scaffold for serine hydrolase inhibitor discovery. Here, we have tested this hypothesis by screening ABLs more broadly against cell and tissue proteomes by competitive activity-based protein profiling (ABPP), leading to the discovery of lead inhibitors for several serine hydrolases, including the uncharacterized enzyme α,β-hydrolase domain-containing 10 (ABHD10). ABPP-guided medicinal chemistry yielded a compound ABL303 that potently (IC(50) ≈ 30 nM) and selectively inactivated ABHD10 in vitro and in living cells. A comparison of optimized inhibitors for PME-1 and ABHD10 indicates that modest structural changes that alter steric bulk can tailor the ABL to selectively react with distinct, distantly related serine hydrolases. Our findings, taken together, designate the ABL as a versatile reactive group for creating first-in-class serine hydrolase inhibitors.	0
Title: Generation of complexity in fungal terpene biosynthesis: discovery of a multifunctional cytochrome P450 in the fumagillin pathway Abstract: Fumagillin (1), a meroterpenoid from Aspergillus fumigatus, is known for its antiangiogenic activity due to binding to human methionine aminopeptidase 2. 1 has a highly oxygenated structure containing a penta-substituted cyclohexane that is generated by oxidative cleavage of the bicyclic sesquiterpene β-trans-bergamotene. The chemical nature, order, and biochemical mechanism of all the oxygenative tailoring reactions has remained enigmatic despite the identification of the biosynthetic gene cluster and the use of targeted-gene deletion experiments. Here, we report the identification and characterization of three oxygenases from the fumagillin biosynthetic pathway, including a multifunctional cytochrome P450 monooxygenase, a hydroxylating nonheme-iron-dependent dioxygenase, and an ABM family monooxygenase for oxidative cleavage of the polyketide moiety. Most significantly, the P450 monooxygenase is shown to catalyze successive hydroxylation, bicyclic ring-opening, and two epoxidations that generate the sesquiterpenoid core skeleton of 1. We also characterized a truncated polyketide synthase with a ketoreductase function that controls the configuration at C-5 of hydroxylated intermediates.	1
Title: Selective Transformation of Nickel-Bound Formate to CO or C-C Coupling Products Triggered by Deprotonation and Steered by Alkali-Metal Ions Abstract: The complexes [LtBu Ni(OCO-κ2 O,C)]M3 [N(SiMe3 )2 ]2 (M=Li, Na, K), synthesized by deprotonation of a nickel formate complex [LtBu NiOOCH] with the corresponding amides M[N(SiMe3 )2 ], feature a NiII -CO2 2- core surrounded by Lewis-acidic cations (M+ ) and the influence of the latter on the behavior and reactivity was studied. The results point to a decrease of CO2 activation within the series Li, Na, and K, which is also reflected in the reactivity with Me3 SiOTf leading to the liberation of CO and formation of a Ni-OSiMe3 complex. Furthermore, in case of K+ , the {[K3 [N(SiMe3 )2 ]2 }+ shell around the Ni-CO2 2- entity was shown to have a large impact on its stabilization and behavior. If the number of K[N(SiMe3 )2 ] equivalents used in the reaction with [LtBu NiOOCH] is decreased from 3 to 0.5, the deprotonated part of the precursor enters a complex reaction sequence with formation of [LtBu NiI (μ-OOCH)NiI LtBu ]K and [LtBu Ni(C2 O4 )NiLtBu ]. The same reaction at higher concentrations additionally led to the formation of a unique hexanuclear NiII complex containing both oxalate and mesoxalate ([O2 C-CO2 -CO2 ]4- ) ligands.	0
Title: Gausemycins A,B: Cyclic Lipoglycopeptides from Streptomyces sp.* Abstract: We report a novel family of natural lipoglycopeptides produced by Streptomyces sp. INA-Ac-5812. Two major components of the mixture, named gausemycins A and B, were isolated, and their structures were elucidated. The compounds are cyclic peptides with a unique peptide core and several remarkable structural features, including unusual positions of d-amino acids, lack of the Ca2+ -binding Asp-X-Asp-Gly (DXDG) motif, tyrosine glycosylation with arabinose, presence of 2-amino-4-hydroxy-4-phenylbutyric acid (Ahpb) and chlorinated kynurenine (ClKyn), and N-acylation of the ornithine side chain. Gausemycins have pronounced activity against Gram-positive bacteria. Mechanistic studies highlight significant differences compared to known glyco- and lipopeptides. Gausemycins exhibit only slight Ca2+ -dependence of activity and induce no pore formation at low concentrations. Moreover, there is no detectable accumulation of cell wall biosynthesis precursors under treatment with gausemycins.	1
Title: Binding Methylarginines and Methyllysines as Free Amino Acids: A Comparative Study of Multiple Host Classes Abstract: Methylated free amino acids are an important class of targets for host-guest chemistry that have recognition properties distinct from those of methylated peptides and proteins. We present comparative binding studies for three different host classes that are each studied with multiple methylated arginines and lysines to determine fundamental structure-function relationships. The hosts studied are all anionic and include three calixarenes, two acyclic cucurbiturils, and two other cleft-like hosts, a clip and a tweezer. We determined the binding association constants for a panel of methylated amino acids using indicator displacement assays. The acyclic cucurbiturils display stronger binding to the methylated amino acids, and some unique patterns of selectivity. The two other cleft-like hosts follow two different trends, shallow host (clip) following similar trends to the calixarenes, and the other more closed host (tweezer) binding certain less-methylated amino acids stronger than their methylated counterparts. Molecular modelling sheds some light on the different preferences of the various hosts. The results identify hosts with new selectivities and with affinities in a range that could be useful for biomedical applications. The overall selectivity patterns are explained by a common framework that considers the geometry, depth of binding pockets, and functional group participation across all host classes.	0
Title: Andrimid producers encode an acetyl-CoA carboxyltransferase subunit resistant to the action of the antibiotic Abstract: Andrimid is a hybrid nonribosomal peptide-polyketide antibiotic that blocks the carboxyl-transfer reaction of bacterial acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) and thereby inhibits fatty acid biosynthesis with submicromolar potency. The andrimid biosynthetic gene cluster from Pantoea agglomerans encodes an admT gene with homology to the acetyl-CoA carboxyltransferase (CT) beta-subunit gene accD. Escherichia coli cells overexpressing admT showed resistance to andrimid. Co-overproduction of AdmT with E. coli CT alpha-subunit AccA allowed for the in vitro reconstitution of an active heterologous tetrameric CT A(2)T(2) complex. A subsequent andrimid-inhibition assay revealed an IC(50) of 500 nM for this hybrid A(2)T(2) in contrast to that of 12 nM for E. coli CT A(2)D(2). These results validated that AdmT is an AccD homolog that confers resistance in the andrimid producer. Mutagenesis studies guided by the x-ray crystal structure of the E. coli A(2)D(2) complex disclosed a single amino acid mutation of AdmT (L203M) responsible for 5-fold andrimid sensitivity (IC(50) = 100 nM). Complementarily, the E. coli AccD mutant M203L became 5-fold more resistant in the CT assays. This observation allowed for bioinformatic identification of several Vibrio cholerae strains in which accD genes encode the Met<-->Leu switches, and their occurrences correlate predictively with sensitivities to andrimid in vivo.	1
Title: DNA-Catalyzed Amide Hydrolysis Abstract: DNA catalysts (deoxyribozymes) for a variety of reactions have been identified by in vitro selection. However, for certain reactions this identification has not been achieved. One important example is DNA-catalyzed amide hydrolysis, for which a previous selection experiment instead led to DNA-catalyzed DNA phosphodiester hydrolysis. Subsequent efforts in which the selection strategy deliberately avoided phosphodiester hydrolysis led to DNA-catalyzed ester and aromatic amide hydrolysis, but aliphatic amide hydrolysis has been elusive. In the present study, we show that including modified nucleotides that bear protein-like functional groups (any one of primary amino, carboxyl, or primary hydroxyl) enables identification of amide-hydrolyzing deoxyribozymes. In one case, the same deoxyribozyme sequence without the modifications still retains substantial catalytic activity. Overall, these findings establish the utility of introducing protein-like functional groups into deoxyribozymes for identifying new catalytic function. The results also suggest the longer-term feasibility of deoxyribozymes as artificial proteases.	0
Title: Two Cooperative Glycosyltransferases Are Responsible for the Sugar Diversity of Saquayamycins Isolated from Streptomyces sp. KY 40-1 Abstract: Glycosyltransferases are key enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of valuable natural products providing an excellent drug-tailoring tool. Herein, we report the identification of two cooperative glycosyltransferases from the sqn gene cluster directing the biosynthesis of saquayamycins in Streptomyces sp. KY40-1: SqnG1 and SqnG2. Gene inactivation of sqnG1 leads to 50-fold decrease in saquayamycin production, while inactivation of sqnG2 leads to complete production loss, suggesting that SqnG2 acts as dual O- and C-glycosyltransferase. Gene inactivation of a third putative glycosyltransferase-encoding gene, sqnG3, does not affect saquayamycin production in a major way, suggesting that SqnG3 has no or a supportive role in glycosylation. The data indicate that SqnG1 and SqnG2 are solely and possibly cooperatively responsible for the sugar diversity observed in saquayamycins 1-7. This is the first evidence of a glycosyltransferase system showing codependence to achieve dual O- and C-glycosyltransferase activity, utilizing NDP-activated d-olivose, l-rhodinose, as well as an unusual amino sugar, presumably 3,6-dideoxy-l-idosamine.	1
Title: In vitro activity of plant extracts and alkaloids against clinical isolates of extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing strains Abstract: The antibacterial activity of 80% ethanol extracts of 10 medicinal plants collected in Yunnan (Southwest China), was tested against clinical isolates of extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing strains. Their MIC values ranged between 1.56-12.50 mg/mL. The most active plant extract was Chelidonium majus L. (MIC = 1.56 mg/mL). Two potent isoquinoline alkaloids, 8-hydroxydihydrosanguinarine and 8-hydroxydihydrochelerythrine, were identified as the major active principles through bioassay-guided fractionation and identification of the active ethyl acetate fraction from C. majus, with minimum MIC/MBC values of 15.63/62.50 mg/mL.	0
Title: Energy Transfer between Spatially Separated Entangled Molecules Abstract: Light-matter strong coupling allows for the possibility of entangling the wave functions of different molecules through the light field. We hereby present direct evidence of non-radiative energy transfer well beyond the Förster limit for spatially separated donor and acceptor cyanine dyes strongly coupled to a cavity. The transient dynamics and the static spectra show an energy transfer efficiency approaching 37 % for donor-acceptor distances ≥100 nm. In such systems, the energy transfer process becomes independent of distance as long as the coupling strength is maintained. This is consistent with the entangled and delocalized nature of the polaritonic states.	0
Title: Modular Chemoenzymatic Synthesis of GE81112 B1 and Related Analogues Enables Elucidation of Its Key Pharmacophores Abstract: The GE81112 complex has garnered much interest due to its broad antimicrobial properties and unique ability to inhibit bacterial translation initiation. Herein we report the use of a chemoenzymatic strategy to complete the first total synthesis of GE81112 B1. By pairing iron and α-ketoglutarate dependent hydroxylases found in GE81112 biosynthesis with traditional synthetic methodology, we were able to access the natural product in 11 steps (longest linear sequence). Following this strategy, 10 GE81112 B1 analogues were synthesized, allowing for identification of its key pharmacophores. A key feature of our medicinal chemistry effort is the incorporation of additional biocatalytic hydroxylations in modular analogue synthesis to rapidly enable exploration of relevant chemical space.	0
Title: Production of a new thiopeptide antibiotic, TP-1161, by a marine Nocardiopsis species Abstract: Twenty-seven marine sediment- and sponge-derived actinomycetes with a preference for or dependence on seawater for growth were classified at the genus level using molecular taxonomy. Their potential to produce bioactive secondary metabolites was analyzed by PCR screening for genes involved in polyketide and nonribosomal peptide antibiotic synthesis. Using microwell cultures, conditions for the production of antibacterial and antifungal compounds were identified for 15 of the 27 isolates subjected to this screening. Nine of the 15 active extracts were also active against multiresistant gram-positive bacterial and/or fungal indicator organisms, including vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium and multidrug-resistant Candida albicans. Activity-guided fractionation of fermentation extracts of isolate TFS65-07, showing strong antibacterial activity and classified as a Nocardiopsis species, allowed the identification and purification of the active compound. Structure elucidation revealed this compound to be a new thiopeptide antibiotic with a rare aminoacetone moiety. The in vitro antibacterial activity of this thiopeptide, designated TP-1161, against a panel of bacterial strains was determined.	1
Title: Fully reagent-controlled asymmetric synthesis of (-)-spongidepsin via the Zr-catalyzed asymmetric carboalumination of alkenes (ZACA reaction) Abstract: The ZACA reaction has been shown to proceed satisfactorily with internally OH-substituted 1-alkenes, provided that the OH group is unprotected and non-allylic. This reaction was used for reagent-controlled asymmetric construction of 3. Allylic alcohol was converted to 2 in seven steps via iterative ZACA processes and simple chromatography. (-)-Spongidepsin (1) was synthesized by using 2 and 3 through application of the esterification-amidation-ring-closing metathesis protocol previously reported.	0
Title: Targeting folded RNA: a branched peptide boronic acid that binds to a large surface area of HIV-1 RRE RNA Abstract: On-bead high-throughput screening of a medium-sized (1000-2000 Da) branched peptide boronic acid (BPBA) library consisting of 46,656 unique sequences against HIV-1 RRE RNA generated peptides with binding affinities in the low micromolar range. In particular, BPBA1 had a K(d) of 1.4 μM with RRE IIB, preference for RNA over DNA (27 fold), and selectivity of up to >75 fold against a panel of RRE IIB variants. Structure-activity studies suggest that the boronic acid moiety and "branching" in peptides are key structural features for efficient binding and selectivity for the folded RNA target. BPBA1 was efficiently taken up by HeLa and A2780 cells. RNA-footprinting studies revealed that the BPBA1 binding site encompasses a large surface area that spans both the upper stem as well as the internal loop regions of RRE IIB.	0
Title: Characterization of the nocardiopsin biosynthetic gene cluster reveals similarities to and differences from the rapamycin and FK-506 pathways Abstract: Macrolide-pipecolate natural products, such as rapamycin (1) and FK-506 (2), are renowned modulators of FK506-binding proteins (FKBPs). The nocardiopsins, from Nocardiopsis sp. CMB-M0232, are the newest members of this structural class. Here, the biosynthetic pathway for nocardiopsins A-D (4-7) is revealed by cloning, sequencing, and bioinformatic analyses of the nsn gene cluster. In vitro evaluation of recombinant NsnL revealed that this lysine cyclodeaminase catalyzes the conversion of L-lysine into the L-pipecolic acid incorporated into 4 and 5. Bioinformatic analyses supported the conjecture that a linear nocardiopsin precursor is equipped with the hydroxy group required for macrolide closure in a previously unobserved manner by employing a P450 epoxidase (NsnF) and limonene epoxide hydrolase homologue (NsnG). The nsn cluster also encodes candidates for tetrahydrofuran group biosynthesis. The nocardiopsin pathway provides opportunities for engineering of FKBP-binding metabolites and for probing new enzymology in nature's polyketide tailoring arsenal.	1
Title: Characterization of the Aspergillus nidulans monodictyphenone gene cluster Abstract: Deletion of cclA, a component of the COMPASS complex of Aspergillus nidulans, results in the production of monodictyphenone and emodin derivatives. Through a set of targeted deletions in a cclA deletion strain, we have identified the genes required for monodictyphenone and emodin analog biosynthesis. Identification of an intermediate, endocrocin, from an mdpHDelta strain suggests that mdpH might encode a decarboxylase. Furthermore, by replacing the promoter of mdpA (a putative aflJ homolog) and mdpE (a putative aflR homolog) with the inducible alcA promoter, we have confirmed that MdpA functions as a coactivator. We propose a biosynthetic pathway for monodictyphenone and emodin derivatives based on bioinformatic analysis and characterization of biosynthetic intermediates.	1
Title: Identification of functionally clustered nystatin-like biosynthetic genes in a rare actinomycetes, Pseudonocardia autotrophica Abstract: The polyene antibiotics, including nystatin, pimaricin, amphotericin, and candicidin, comprise a family of very valuable antifungal polyketide compounds, and they are typically produced by soil actinomycetes. Previously, using a polyene cytochrome P450 hydroxylase-specific genome screening strategy, Pseudonocardia autotrophica KCTC9441 was determined to contain genes potentially encoding polyene biosynthesis. Here, sequence information of an approximately 125.7-kb contiguous DNA region in five overlapping cosmids isolated from the P. autotrophica KCTC9441 genomic library revealed a total of 23 open reading frames, which are presumably involved in the biosynthesis of a nystatin-like compound tentatively named NPP. The deduced roles for six multi-modular polyketide synthase (PKS) catalytic domains were found to be highly homologous to those of previously identified nystatin biosynthetic genes. Low NPP productivity suggests that the functionally clustered NPP biosynthetic pathway genes are tightly regulated in P. autotrophica. Disruption of a NPP PKS gene completely abolished both NPP biosynthesis and antifungal activity against Candida albicans, suggesting that polyene-specific genome screening may constitute an efficient method for isolation of potentially valuable previously identified polyene genes and compounds from various rare actinomycetes widespread in nature.	1
Title: High-level genomic integration, epigenetic changes, and expression of sleeping beauty transgene Abstract: Sleeping Beauty transposon (SB-Tn) has emerged as an important nonviral vector for integrating transgenes into mammalian genomes. We report here a novel dual fluorescent reporter cis SB-Tn system that permitted nonselective fluorescent-activated cell sorting for SB-Tn-transduced K562 erythroid cells. Using an internal ribosome entry site element, the green fluorescent protein (eGFP) was linked to the SB10 transposase gene as an indirect marker for the robust expression of SB10 transposase. Flourescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) by eGFP resulted in significant enrichment (>60%) of cells exhibiting SB-Tn-mediated genomic insertions and long-term expression of a DsRed transgene. The hybrid erythroid-specific promoter of DsRed transgene was verified in erythroid or megakaryocyte differentiation of K562 cells. Bisulfite-mediated genomic analyses identified different DNA methylation patterns between DsRed(+) and DsRed(-) cell clones, suggesting a critical role in transgene expression. Moreover, although the host genomic copy of the promoter element showed no CpG methylation, the same sequence carried by the transgene was markedly hypermethylated. Additional evidence also suggested a role for histone deacetylation in the regulation of DsRed transgene. The presence of SB transgene affected the expression of neighboring host genes at distances >45 kb. Our data suggested that a fluorescent reporter cis SB-Tn system can be used to enrich mammalian cells harboring SB-mediated transgene insertions. The observed epigenetic changes also demonstrated that transgenes inserted by SB could be selectively modified by endogenous factors. In addition, long-range activation of host genes must now be recognized as a potential consequence of an inserted transgene cassette containing enhancer elements.	0
Title: Characterization of biosynthetic gene cluster for the production of virginiamycin M, a streptogramin type A antibiotic, in Streptomyces virginiae Abstract: Virginiamycin M (VM) of Streptomyces virginiae is a hybrid polyketide-peptide antibiotic with peptide antibiotic virginiamycin S (VS) as its synergistic counterpart. VM and VS belong to the Streptogramin family, which is characterized by strong synergistic antibacterial activity, and their water-soluble derivatives are a new therapeutic option for combating vancomycin-resistant Gram-positive bacteria. Here, the VM biosynthetic gene cluster was isolated from S. virginiae in the 62-kb region located in the vicinity of the regulatory island for virginiamycin production. Sequence analysis revealed that the region consists of 19 complete open reading frames (ORFs) and one C-terminally truncated ORF, encoding hybrid polyketide synthase (PKS)-nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS), typical PKS, enzymes synthesizing precursors for VM, transporters for resistance, regulatory proteins, and auxiliary enzymes. The involvement of the cloned gene cluster in VM biosynthesis was confirmed by gene disruption of virA encoding a hybrid PKS-NRPS megasynthetase, which resulted in complete loss of VM production without any effect on VS production. To assemble the VM core structure, VirA, VirF, VirG, and VirH consisting, as a whole, of 24 domains in 8 PKS modules and 7 domains in 2 NRPS modules were predicted to act as an acyltransferase (AT)-less hybrid PKS-NRPS, whereas VirB, VirC, VirD, and VirE are likely to be essential for the incorporation of the methyl group into the VM framework by a HMG-CoA synthase-based reaction. Among several uncommon features of gene organization in the VM gene cluster, the lack of AT domain in every PKS module and the presence of a discrete AT encoded by virI are notable. AT-overexpression by an additional copy of virI driven by ermEp() resulted in 1.5-fold increase of VM production, suggesting that the amount of VirI is partly limiting VM biosynthesis.	1
Title: Accessing Both Retention and Inversion Pathways in Stereospecific, Nickel-Catalyzed Miyaura Borylations of Allylic Pivalates Abstract: We have developed a stereospecific, nickel-catalyzed Miyaura borylation of allylic pivalates, which delivers highly enantioenriched α-stereogenic γ-aryl allylboronates with good yields and regioselectivities. Our complementary sets of conditions enable access to either enantiomer of allylboronate product from a single enantiomer of readily prepared allylic pivalate substrate. Excellent functional group tolerance, yields, regioselectivities, and stereochemical fidelities are observed. The stereochemical switch from stereoretention to stereoinversion largely depends upon solvent and can be explained by competitive pathways for the oxidative addition step. Our mechanistic investigations support a stereoretentive pathway stemming from a directed oxidative addition and a stereoinvertive pathway that is dominant when MeCN blocks coordination of the directing group by binding the nickel catalyst.	0
Title: Metabolic suppression identifies new antibacterial inhibitors under nutrient limitation Abstract: Characterizing new drugs and chemical probes of biological systems is hindered by difficulties in identifying the mechanism of action (MOA) of biologically active molecules. Here we present a metabolite suppression approach to explore the MOA of antibacterial compounds under nutrient restriction. We assembled an array of metabolites that can be screened for suppressors of inhibitory molecules. Further, we identified inhibitors of Escherichia coli growth under nutrient limitation and charted their interactions with our metabolite array. This strategy led to the discovery and characterization of three new antibacterial compounds, MAC168425, MAC173979 and MAC13772. We showed that MAC168425 interferes with glycine metabolism, MAC173979 is a time-dependent inhibitor of p-aminobenzoic acid biosynthesis and MAC13772 inhibits biotin biosynthesis. We conclude that metabolite suppression profiling is an effective approach to focus MOA studies on compounds impairing metabolic capabilities. Such bioactives can serve as chemical probes of bacterial physiology and as leads for antibacterial drug development.	0
Title: Mining the cinnabaramide biosynthetic pathway to generate novel proteasome inhibitors Abstract: The cinnabaramides and salinosporamides are mixed PKS/NRPS natural products isolated from a terrestrial streptomycete and a marine actinomycete, respectively. They interfere with the proteasome and thus potentially inhibit the growth of cancer cells. The compounds exhibit a γ-lactam-β-lactone bicyclic ring structure attached to a cyclohexenyl unit and a PKS side chain. As a first step towards improving anticancer activity and permitting genetic approaches to novel analogues, we have cloned and characterized the cinnabaramide biosynthetic genes from Streptomyces sp. JS360. In addition to the expected PKS and NRPS genes, the cluster encodes functionalities for the assembly of the hexyl side chain precursor. The corresponding enzymes exhibit relaxed substrate specificities towards a number of synthesized precursors, enabling production of novel chlorinated cinnabaramides. These were isolated and analyzed for activity, revealing that derivatives bearing a chlorine atom in the PKS side chain show higher inhibitory potentials towards the proteasome's proteolytic subunits (especially the trypsin and chymotrypsin units) and higher cytotoxicities towards human tumor cell lines than the parent cinnabaramide A. Although their activities towards the proteasome were weaker than that of salinosporamide A, the cinnabaramides were found to inhibit the growth of various fungi with greater potency.	1
Title: Wireless activation of neurons in brain slices using nanostructured semiconductor photoelectrodes Abstract: Light rather than electrical current: The inner or outer surfaces of glass micropipettes can be coated with nanoparticles of a narrow-band-gap semiconductor. When visible or near-infrared light is used for excitation, these micropipettes (labeled PE Stim in the image) can activate nearby neurons (labeled *) in brain tissue without the damage associated with electrical stimulation.	0
Title: Fusarium Tri4 encodes a key multifunctional cytochrome P450 monooxygenase for four consecutive oxygenation steps in trichothecene biosynthesis Abstract: Fusarium Tri4 encodes a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase (CYP) for hydroxylation at C-2 of the first committed intermediate trichodiene (TDN) in the biosynthesis of trichothecenes. To examine whether this CYP further participates in subsequent oxygenation steps leading to isotrichotriol (4), we engineered Saccharomyces cerevisiae for de novo production of the early intermediates by introducing cDNAs of Fusarium graminearum Tri5 (FgTri5 encoding TDN synthase) and Tri4 (FgTri4). From a culture of the engineered yeast grown on induction medium (final pH 2.7), we identified two intermediates, 2alpha-hydroxytrichodiene (1) and 12,13-epoxy-9,10-trichoene-2alpha-ol (2), and a small amount of non-Fusarium trichothecene 12,13-epoxytrichothec-9-ene (EPT). Other intermediates isotrichodiol (3) and 4 were identified in the transgenic yeasts grown on phosphate-buffered induction medium (final pH 5.5-6.0). When Trichothecium roseum Tri4 (TrTri4) was used in place of FgTri4, 4 was not detected in the culture. The three intermediates, 1, 2, and 3, were converted to 4,15-diacetylnivalenol (4,15-diANIV) when fed to a toxin-deficient mutant of F. graminearum with the FgTri4+ genetic background (viz., by introducing a FgTri5- mutation), but were not metabolized by an FgTri4- mutant. These results provide unambiguous evidence that FgTri4 encodes a multifunctional CYP for epoxidation at C-12,13, hydroxylation at C-11, and hydroxylation at C-3 in addition to hydroxylation at C-2.	1
Title: Short-duration low-direct-current electrical field treatment is a practical tool for considerably reducing counts of gram-negative bacteria entrapped in gel beads Abstract: Application of a direct-current electrical field for very short times can serve as a practical nonthermal procedure to reduce or modify the microbial distribution in gel beads. The viability of Escherichia coli and Serratia marcescens entrapped in alginate and agarose beads decreases as the field intensity and duration of electrical field increase.	0
Title: Novel genomic locus with atypical G+C content that is required for extracellular polysaccharide production and virulence in Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae Abstract: Three exopolysaccharide (EPS)- and virulence-deficient mutants of Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae, the causal agent of bacterial leaf blight of rice, were isolated by Tn5 mutagenesis. These insertions are not located within the gum gene cluster. A 40-kb cosmid clone that restored EPS production and virulence to all three mutants was isolated, and the three transposon insertions were localized to contiguous 4.3- and 3.5-kb EcoRI fragments that are included in this clone. Sequence data indicate that two of the transposon insertions are in genes that encode a putative sugar nucleotide epimerase and a putative glycosyl transferase, respectively; the third insertion is located between the glycosyl transferase gene and a novel open reading frame (ORF). A 5.5-kb genomic region in which these three ORFs are located has a G+C content of 5-1.7%, quite different from the G+C content of approximately 65.0% that is typical of X. oryzae pv. oryzae. Homologues of this locus have not yet been reported in any other xanthomonad.	1
Title: Distance-dependent translational coupling and interference in Lactococcus lactis Abstract: The possibility of raising the expression level of a heterologous gene in Lactococcus lactis by exploiting the principle of translational coupling was investigated. For this purpose, the Escherichia coli lacZ gene was transcriptionally fused to a short open reading frame (ORF) of lactococcal origin. A Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence was introduced at the boundary of the two ORFs. In a series of otherwise identical plasmids, the relative positions of the translational stop codon of the upstream ORF and the translational start codon of the downstream ORF (lacZ) were varied. The expression of lacZ gradually increased as the stop and start codons were placed in closer proximity. A concomitant switch from translational interference to translational coupling was observed. Best results were obtained with partially overlapping stop and start codons. It is concluded that the principle of translational coupling offers good possibilities to increase the level of heterologous gene expression in L. lactis.	0
Title: Visualizing the stoichiometry of industrial-style Co-Mo-S catalysts with single-atom sensitivity Abstract: The functional properties of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) may be promoted by the inclusion of other elements. Here, we studied the local stoichiometry of single cobalt promoter atoms in an industrial-style MoS2-based hydrotreating catalyst. Aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy and electron energy loss spectroscopy show that the Co atoms occupy sites at the (-100) S edge terminations of the graphite-supported MoS2 nanocrystals in the catalyst. Specifically, each Co atom has four neighboring S atoms that are arranged in a reconstructed geometry, which reflects an equilibrium state. The structure agrees with complementary studies of catalysts that were prepared under vastly different conditions and on other supports. In contrast, a small amount of residual Fe in the graphite is found to compete for the S edge sites, so that promotion by Co is strongly sensitive to the purity of the raw materials. The present single-atom-sensitive analytical method therefore offers a guide for advancing preparative methods for promoted TMD nanomaterials.	0
Title: Allenamide hydro-hydroxyalkylation: 1,2-amino alcohols via ruthenium-catalyzed carbonyl anti-aminoallylation Abstract: Exposure of alcohols to allenamides in the presence of RuHCl(CO)(PPh(3))(3) and dippf [dippf = bis(diisopropylphosphino)ferrocene] results in hydrogen transfer to generate aldehyde-allylruthenium pairs, which engage in C-C coupling to form products of carbonyl aminoallylation as single anti-diastereomers.	0
Title: Functional analysis of genes responsible for the synthesis of the B-band O antigen of Pseudomonas aeruginosa serotype O6 lipopolysaccharide Abstract: This study reports the organization of the wbp gene cluster and characterization of a number of genes that are essential for B-band O antigen biosynthesis in the clinically prevalent Pseudomonas aeruginosa serotype 06. Twelve genes were identified that share homology with other LPS and polysaccharide biosynthetic genes. This cluster contains homologues of wzx (encoding the O antigen flippase/translocase) and wzz (which modulates O antigen chain length distribution) genes, typical of a wzy-dependent pathway. However, a complete wzy gene (encoding the O-polymerase) was not found within the cluster. Four biosynthetic genes, wbpO, wbpP, wbpV and wbpM, and four putative glycosyltransferase genes, wbpR, wbpT, wbpU and wbpL, were identified in the cluster. To characterize their roles in LPS biosynthesis, null mutants of wbpO, wbpP, wbpV, wbpL and wbpM were generated using a gene-replacement strategy. Mutations in each of these genes caused deficiency in B-band synthesis. The wbpL mutant was deficient in both A-band and B-band LPS. WbpL(O6) is a bi-functional enzyme which could initiate B-band synthesis through the addition of QuiNAc to undecaprenol phosphate, and A-band synthesis by transferring either a GalNAc or a GlcNAc residue. Another approach used to assign function to the wbp(O6) genes was by complementation analysis. Two genes from Salmonella typhi, wcdA and wcdB, responsible for the synthesis of a homopolymer of GalNAcA called Vi antigen were used in complementation experiments to verify the functions of wbpO and wbpP. wcdA and wcdB restored B-band synthesis in wbpO and wbpP mutants respectively, implying that wbpO and wbpP are involved in UDP-GalNAcA synthesis. Although wbpV has homology to wbpK of the serotype O5 B-band LPS synthesis cluster, complementation analysis using the respective null mutants showed that the genes are not interchangeable. A knockout mutation of wbpN (located downstream of wbpM) did not abrogate LPS synthesis in either 05 or 06; therefore, it has been renamed orf48.5. These results establish the organization of genes involved in P. aeruginosa B-band O antigen synthesis and provide the evidence to assign functions to a number of LPS biosynthetic genes.	1
Title: GacS sensor domains pertinent to the regulation of exoproduct formation and to the biocontrol potential of Pseudomonas fluorescens CHA0 Abstract: In the root-colonizing biocontrol strain CHA0 of Pseudomonas fluorescens, cell density-dependent synthesis of extracellular, plant-beneficial secondary metabolites and enzymes is positively regulated by the GacS/GacA two-component system. Mutational analysis of the GacS sensor kinase using improved single-copy vectors showed that inactivation of each of the three conserved phosphate acceptor sites caused an exoproduct null phenotype (GacS-), whereas deletion of the periplasmic loop domain had no significant effect on the expression of exoproduct genes. Strain CHA0 is known to synthesize a solvent-extractable extracellular signal that advances and enhances the expression of exoproduct genes during the transition from exponential to stationary growth phase when maximal exoproduct formation occurs. Mutational inactivation of either GacS or its cognate response regulator GacA abolished the strain's response to added signal. Deletion of the linker domain of the GacS sensor kinase caused signal-independent, strongly elevated expression of exoproduct genes at low cell densities. In contrast to the wild-type strain CHA0, the gacS linker mutant and a gacS null mutant were unable to protect tomato plants from crown and root rot caused by Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. radicis-lycopersici in a soil-less microcosm, indicating that, at least in this plant-pathogen system, there is no advantage in using a signal-independent biocontrol strain.	0
Title: Chalcomycin biosynthesis gene cluster from Streptomyces bikiniensis: novel features of an unusual ketolide produced through expression of the chm polyketide synthase in Streptomyces fradiae Abstract: Chalcomycin, a 16-membered macrolide antibiotic made by the bacterium Streptomyces bikiniensis, contains a 2,3-trans double bond and the neutral sugar D-chalcose in place of the amino sugar mycaminose found in most other 16-membered macrolides. Degenerate polyketide synthase (PKS)-specific primers were used to amplify DNA fragments from S. bikiniensis with very high identity to a unique ketosynthase domain of the tylosin PKS. The resulting amplimers were used to identify two overlapping cosmids encompassing the chm PKS. Sequencing revealed a contiguous segment of >60 kb carrying 25 putative genes for biosynthesis of the polyketide backbone, the two deoxysugars, and enzymes involved in modification of precursors of chalcomycin or resistance to it. The chm PKS lacks the ketoreductase and dehydratase domains in the seventh module expected to produce the 2,3-double bond in chalcomycin. Expression of PKS in the heterologous host Streptomyces fradiae, from which the tyl genes encoding the PKS had been removed, resulted in production of at least one novel compound, characterized as a 3-keto 16-membered macrolactone in equilibrium with its 3-trans enol tautomer and containing the sugar mycaminose at the C-5 position, in agreement with the structure predicted on the basis of the domain organization of the chm PKS. The production of a 3-keto macrolide from the chm PKS indicates that a discrete set of enzymes is responsible for the introduction of the 2,3-trans double bond in chalcomycin. From comparisons of the open reading frames to sequences in databases, a pathway for the synthesis of nucleoside diphosphate-D-chalcose was proposed.	1
Title: A Two-Dimensional Zirconium Carbide by Selective Etching of Al3C3 from Nanolaminated Zr3Al3C5 Abstract: The room-temperature synthesis of a new two-dimensional (2D) zirconium-containing carbide, Zr3C2T(z) MXene is presented. In contrast to traditional preparation of MXene, the layered ternary Zr3Al3C5 material instead of MAX phases is used as source under hydrofluoric acid treatment. The structural, mechanical, and electronic properties of the synthesized 2D carbide are investigated, combined with first-principles density functional calculations. A comparative study on the structrual stability of our obtained 2D Zr3C2T(z) and Ti3C2T(z) MXenes at elevated temperatures is performed. The obtained 2D Zr3C2T(z) exhibits relatively better ability to maintain 2D nature and strucural integrity compared to Ti-based Mxene. The difference in structural stability under high temperature condition is explained by a theoretical investigation on binding energy.	0
Title: Protein Patterns and Oscillations on Lipid Monolayers and in Microdroplets Abstract: The Min proteins from E.coli position the bacterial cell-division machinery through pole-to-pole oscillations. In vitro, Min protein self-organization can be reconstituted in the presence of a lipid membrane as a catalytic surface. However, Min dynamics have so far not been reconstituted in fully membrane-enclosed volumes. Microdroplets interfaced by lipid monolayers were employed as a simple 3D mimic of cellular compartments to reconstitute Min protein oscillations. We demonstrate that lipid monolayers are sufficient to fulfil the catalytic role of the membrane and thus represent a facile platform to investigate Min protein regulated dynamics of the cell-division protein FtsZ-mts. In particular, we show that droplet containers reveal distinct Min oscillation modes, and reveal a dependence of FtsZ-mts structures on compartment size. Finally, co-reconstitution of Min proteins and FtsZ-mts in droplets yields antagonistic localization, thus demonstrating that droplets indeed support the analysis of complex bacterial self-organization in confined volumes.	0
Title: Development of a Multifunctional Benzophenone Linker for Peptide Stapling and Photoaffinity Labelling Abstract: Photoaffinity labelling is a useful method for studying how proteins interact with ligands and biomolecules, and can help identify and characterise new targets for the development of new therapeutics. We present the design and synthesis of a novel multifunctional benzophenone linker that serves as both a photo-crosslinking motif and a peptide stapling reagent. Using double-click stapling, we attached the benzophenone to the peptide via the staple linker, rather than by modifying the peptide sequence with a photo-crosslinking amino acid. When applied to a p53-derived peptide, the resulting photoreactive stapled peptide was able to preferentially crosslink with MDM2 in the presence of competing protein. This multifunctional linker also features an extra alkyne handle for downstream applications such as pull-down assays, and can be used to investigate the target selectivity of stapled peptides.	0
Title: Structure and regulation of the omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid synthase genes from the deep-sea bacterium Photobacterium profundum strain SS9 Abstract: Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) such as eicosapentaenoic acid (20:5n-3; EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (22:6n-3; DHA) have been shown to be of major importance in the promotion of cardiovascular health, proper human development and the prevention of some cancers. A high proportion of bacterial isolates from low-temperature and high-pressure marine environments produce EPA or DHA. This paper presents the sequence of a 33 kbp locus from the deep-sea bacterium Photobacterium profundum strain SS9 which includes four of the five genes required for EPA biosynthesis. As with other bacterial pfa (polyunsaturated fatty acid) genes, the deduced amino acid sequences encoded by the SS9 genes reveal large multidomain proteins that are likely to catalyse EPA biosynthesis by a novel polyketide synthesis mechanism. RNase protection experiments separated the SS9 pfa genes into two transcriptional units, pfaA-C and pfaD. The pfaA transcriptional start site was identified. Cultivation at elevated hydrostatic pressure or reduced temperature did not increase pfa gene expression despite the resulting increase in percentage composition of EPA under these conditions. However, a regulatory mutant was characterized which showed both increased expression of pfaA-D and elevated EPA percentage composition. This result suggests that a regulatory factor exists which coordinates pfaA-D transcription. Additional consideration regarding the activities required for PUFA synthesis is provided together with comparative analyses of bacterial pfa genes and gene products.	1
Title: Promoting Molecular Exchange on Rare-Earth Oxycarbonate Surfaces to Catalyze the Water-Gas Shift Reaction Abstract: It is highly desirable to fabricate an accessible catalyst surface that can efficiently activate reactants and desorb products to promote the local surface reaction equilibrium in heterogeneous catalysis. Herein, rare-earth oxycarbonates (Ln2O2CO3, where Ln = La and Sm), which have molecular-exchangeable (H2O and CO2) surface structures according to the ordered layered arrangement of Ln2O22+ and CO32- ions, are unearthed. On this basis, a series of Ln2O2CO3-supported Cu catalysts are prepared through the deposition precipitation method, which provides excellent catalytic activity and stability for the water-gas shift (WGS) reaction. Density functional theory calculations combined with systematic experimental characterizations verify that H2O spontaneously dissociates on the surface of Ln2O2CO3 to form hydroxyl by eliminating the carbonate through the release of CO2. This interchange efficiently promotes the WGS reaction equilibrium shift on the local surface and prevents the carbonate accumulation from hindering the active sites. The discovery of the unique layered structure provides a so-called "self-cleaning" active surface for the WGS reaction and opens new perspectives about the application of rare-earth oxycarbonate nanomaterials in C1 chemistry.	0
Title: Biosynthesis of lycosantalonol, a cis-prenyl derived diterpenoid Abstract: Terpenoid natural products are generally derived from isoprenyl diphosphate precursors with trans double-bond configuration, and no diterpenoid derived from the cisoid precursor (Z,Z,Z)-nerylneryl diphosphate (1) has yet been identified. Here further investigation of a terpenoid biosynthetic gene cluster from tomato is reported, which resulted in identification of a biosynthetic pathway from 1, in a pathway featuring a number of interesting transformations. Compound 1 is first cyclized to a tricyclene core ring structure analogous to that found in α-santalene, with the resulting diterpene termed here lycosantalene (2). Quantum chemical calculations indicate a role for the diphosphate anion coproduct in this cyclization reaction. Subsequently, the internal cis double bond of the neryl side chain in 2 is then further transformed to an α-hydroxy ketone moiety via an epoxide intermediate (3). Oxygen labeling studies indicate 3 undergoes oxidative conversion to lycosantalonol (4). Thus, in addition to elucidating the cisoid origins of 4, this work has further provided mechanistic insight into the interesting transformations required for its production.	0
Title: Multi-Homologous Recombination-Based Gene Manipulation in the Rice Pathogen Fusarium fujikuroi Abstract: Gene disruption by homologous recombination is widely used to investigate and analyze the function of genes in Fusarium fujikuroi, a fungus that causes bakanae disease and root rot symptoms in rice. To generate gene deletion constructs, the use of conventional cloning methods, which rely on restriction enzymes and ligases, has had limited success due to a lack of unique restriction enzyme sites. Although strategies that avoid the use of restriction enzymes have been employed to overcome this issue, these methods require complicated PCR steps or are frequently inefficient. Here, we introduce a cloning system that utilizes multi-fragment assembly by In-Fusion to generate a gene disruption construct. This method utilizes DNA fragment fusion and requires only one PCR step and one reaction for construction. Using this strategy, a gene disruption construct for Fusarium cyclin C1 (FCC1 ), which is associated with fumonisin B1 biosynthesis, was successfully created and used for fungal transformation. In vivo and in vitro experiments using confirmed fcc1 mutants suggest that fumonisin production is closely related to disease symptoms exhibited by F. fujikuroi strain B14. Taken together, this multi-fragment assembly method represents a simpler and a more convenient process for targeted gene disruption in fungi.	1
Title: Insights into xanthomonas axonopodis pv. citri biofilm through proteomics Abstract: Background:                       Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. citri (X. a. pv. citri) causes citrus canker that can result in defoliation and premature fruit drop with significant production losses worldwide. Biofilm formation is an important process in bacterial pathogens and several lines of evidence suggest that in X. a. pv. citri this process is a requirement to achieve maximal virulence since it has a major role in host interactions. In this study, proteomics was used to gain further insights into the functions of biofilms.                  Results:                       In order to identify differentially expressed proteins, a comparative proteomic study using 2D difference gel electrophoresis was carried out on X. a. pv. citri mature biofilm and planktonic cells. The biofilm proteome showed major variations in the composition of outer membrane proteins and receptor or transport proteins. Among them, several porins and TonB-dependent receptor were differentially regulated in the biofilm compared to the planktonic cells, indicating that these proteins may serve in maintaining specific membrane-associated functions including signaling and cellular homeostasis. In biofilms, UDP-glucose dehydrogenase with a major role in exopolysaccharide production and the non-fimbrial adhesin YapH involved in adherence were over-expressed, while a polynucleotide phosphorylase that was demonstrated to negatively control biofilm formation in E. coli was down-regulated. In addition, several proteins involved in protein synthesis, folding and stabilization were up-regulated in biofilms. Interestingly, some proteins related to energy production, such as ATP-synthase were down-regulated in biofilms. Moreover, a number of enzymes of the tricarboxylic acid cycle were differentially expressed. In addition, X. a. pv. citri biofilms also showed down-regulation of several antioxidant enzymes. The respective gene expression patterns of several identified proteins in both X. a. pv. citri mature biofilm and planktonic cells were evaluated by quantitative real-time PCR and shown to consistently correlate with those deduced from the proteomic study.                  Conclusions:                       Differentially expressed proteins are enriched in functional categories. Firstly, proteins that are down-regulated in X. a. pv. citri biofilms are enriched for the gene ontology (GO) terms 'generation of precursor metabolites and energy' and secondly, the biofilm proteome mainly changes in 'outer membrane and receptor or transport'. We argue that the differentially expressed proteins have a critical role in maintaining a functional external structure as well as enabling appropriate flow of nutrients and signals specific to the biofilm lifestyle.	0
Title: Exploration of solid-state nanopores in characterizing reaction mixtures generated from a catalytic DNA assembly circuit Abstract: Recent advances have proven that using solid-state nanopores is a promising single molecular technique to enrich the DNA assembly signaling library. Other than using them for distinguishing structures, here we innovatively adapt solid-state nanopores for use in analyzing assembly mixtures, which is usually a tougher task for either traditional characterization techniques or nanopores themselves. A trigger induced DNA step polymerization (SP-CHA), producing three-way-DNA concatemers, is designed as a model. Through counting and integrating the translocation-induced current block when each concatemer passes through a glass conical glass nanopore, we propose an electrophoresis-gel like, but homogeneous, quantitative method that can comprehensively profile the "base-pair distribution" of SP-CHA concatemer mixtures. Due to the higher sensitivity, a number of super long concatemers that were previously difficult to detect via gel electrophoresis are also revealed. These ultra-concatemers, longer than 2 kbp, could provide a much enhanced signal-to-noise ratio for nanopores and are thus believed to be more accurate indicators for the existence of a trigger, which may be of benefit for further applications, such as molecular machines or biosensors.	0
Title: Glycopeptide carboxamides active against vancomycin-resistant enterococci Abstract: Glycopeptide antibiotics were synthesized via the PyBOP mediated condensation of aliphatic, heterocyclic and aromatic amines with the C-terminus of vancomycin, LY264826 (A82846B) and semi-synthetic derivatives of these natural products. Amides of LY264826 and vancomycin demonstrated excellent activity against staphylococci and streptococci as compared to the parent natural product. However, the amides of N-alkylated LY264826 and N-alkylated vancomycin were active against vancomycin-resistant enterococci as well as other gram-positive pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus, S. haemolyticus, S. epidermidis and Streptococcus pneumoniae.	0
Title: Increasing the reaction rate of hydroxynitrile lyase from Hevea brasiliensis toward mandelonitrile by copying active site residues from an esterase that accepts aromatic esters Abstract: The natural substrate of hydroxynitrile lyase from rubber tree (HbHNL, Hevea brasiliensis) is acetone cyanohydrin, but synthetic applications usually involve aromatic cyanohydrins such as mandelonitrile. To increase the activity of HbHNL toward this unnatural substrate, we replaced active site residues in HbHNL with the corresponding ones from esterase SABP2 (salicylic acid binding protein 2). Although this enzyme catalyzes a different reaction (hydrolysis of esters), its natural substrate (methyl salicylate) contains an aromatic ring. Three of the eleven single-amino-acid-substitution variants of HbHNL reacted more rapidly with mandelonitrile. The best was HbHNL-L121Y, with a kcat 4.2 times higher and high enantioselectivity. Site-saturation mutagenesis at position 121 identified three other improved variants. We hypothesize that the smaller active site orients the aromatic substrate more productively.	0
Title: Ribosomally derived lipopeptides containing distinct fatty acyl moieties Abstract: Lipopeptides represent a large group of microbial natural products that include important antibacterial and antifungal drugs and some of the most-powerful known biosurfactants. The vast majority of lipopeptides comprise cyclic peptide backbones N-terminally equipped with various fatty acyl moieties. The known compounds of this type are biosynthesized by nonribosomal peptide synthetases, giant enzyme complexes that assemble their products in a non-gene-encoded manner. Here, we report the genome-guided discovery of ribosomally derived, fatty-acylated lipopeptides, termed selidamides. Heterologous reconstitution of three pathways, two from cyanobacteria and one from an arctic, ocean-derived alphaproteobacterium, allowed structural characterization of the probable natural products and suggest that selidamides are widespread over various bacterial phyla. The identified representatives feature cyclic peptide moieties and fatty acyl units attached to (hydroxy)ornithine or lysine side chains by maturases of the GCN5-related N-acetyltransferase superfamily. In contrast to nonribosomal lipopeptides that are usually produced as congener mixtures, the three selidamides are selectively fatty acylated with C10, C12, or C16 fatty acids, respectively. These results highlight the ability of ribosomal pathways to emulate products with diverse, nonribosomal-like features and add to the biocatalytic toolbox for peptide drug improvement and targeted discovery.	1
Title: Microbiota and mitobiota. Putting an equal sign between mitochondria and bacteria Abstract: The recent revival of old theories and setting them on modern scientific rails to a large extent are also relevant to mitochondrial science. Given the widespread belief that mitochondria are symbionts of ancient bacterial origin, the processes inherent to mitochondrial physiology can be revised based on their comparative analysis with possible involvement of bacteria. Such comparison combined with discussion of the role of microbiota in pathogenesis allows discussion of the role of "mitobiota" (we introduce this term) as the combination of different phenotypic manifestations of mitochondria in the organism reflecting pathological changes in the mitochondrial genome. When putting an equal sign between mitochondria and bacteria, we find similarity between the mitochondrial and bacterial theories of cancer. The presence of the term "bacterial infection" suggests "mitochondrial infection", and mitochondrial (oxidative) theory of aging can in some way be transformed into a "bacterial theory of aging". The possible existence of such processes and the data confirming their presence are discussed in this review. If such a comparison has the right to exist, the homeostasis of "mitobiota" is of not lesser physiological importance than homeostasis of microbiota, which has been so intensively discussed recently.	0
Title: Intermolecular Anti-Markovnikov Hydroamination of Unactivated Alkenes with Sulfonamides Enabled by Proton-Coupled Electron Transfer Abstract: Here we report a catalytic method for the intermolecular anti-Markovnikov hydroamination of unactivated alkenes using primary and secondary sulfonamides. These reactions occur at room temperature under visible light irradiation and are jointly catalyzed by an iridium(III) photocatalyst, a dialkyl phosphate base, and a thiol hydrogen atom donor. Reaction outcomes are consistent with the intermediacy of an N-centered sulfonamidyl radical generated via proton-coupled electron transfer activation of the sulfonamide N-H bond. Studies outlining the synthetic scope (>60 examples) and mechanistic features of the reaction are presented.	0
Title: Bifacial PNA complexation inhibits enzymatic access to DNA and RNA Abstract: FULL STOP: Herein we report the effective in vitro inhibition of transcription, reverse-transcription and exonuclease function by formation of synthetic bPNA-nucleic acid triplex structures. Selective bPNA targeting of both DNA and RNA substrates suggests possible application of bPNAs as synthetic regulators of nucleic acid function.	0
Title: Reciprocal Regulation of ERα and ERβ Stability and Activity by Diptoindonesin G Abstract: ERβ is regarded as a "tumor suppressor" in breast cancer due to its anti-proliferative effects. However, unlike ERα, ERβ has not been developed as a therapeutic target in breast cancer due to loss of ERβ in aggressive cancers. In a small-molecule library screen for ERβ stabilizers, we identified Diptoindonesin G (Dip G), which significantly increases ERβ protein stability while decreasing ERα protein levels. Dip G enhances the transcription and anti-proliferative activities of ERβ, while attenuating the transcription and proliferative effects of ERα. Further investigation revealed that instead of targeting ER, Dip G targets the CHIP E3 ubiquitin ligase shared by ERα and ERβ. Thus, Dip G is a dual-functional moiety that reciprocally controls ERα and ERβ protein stability and activities via an indirect mechanism. The ERβ stabilization effects of Dip G may enable the development of ERβ-targeted therapies for human breast cancers.	0
Title: Growth of Toxoplasma gondii is inhibited by aryloxyphenoxypropionate herbicides targeting acetyl-CoA carboxylase Abstract: Aryloxyphenoxypropionates, inhibitors of the plastid acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) of grasses, also inhibit Toxoplasma gondii ACC. Clodinafop, the most effective of the herbicides tested, inhibits growth of T. gondii in human fibroblasts by 70% at 10 microM in 2 days and effectively eliminates the parasite in 2-4 days at 10-100 microM. Clodinafop is not toxic to the host cell even at much higher concentrations. Parasite growth inhibition by different herbicides is correlated with their ability to inhibit ACC enzyme activity, suggesting that ACC is a target for these agents. Fragments of genes encoding the biotin carboxylase domain of multidomain ACCs of T. gondii, Plasmodium falciparum, Plasmodium knowlesi, and Cryptosporidium parvum were sequenced. One T. gondii ACC (ACC1) amino acid sequence clusters with P. falciparum ACC, P. knowlesi ACC, and the putative Cyclotella cryptica chloroplast ACC. Another sequence (ACC2) clusters with that of C. parvum ACC, probably the cytosolic form.	0
Title: ISEcp1-mediated transposition and homologous recombination can explain the context of bla(CTX-M-62) linked to qnrB2 Abstract: bla(CTX-M-62), a C508T variant of bla(CTX-M-3b), was transferred from Klebsiella pneumoniae JIE137 on a conjugative plasmid together with a class 1 integron containing the dfrA12-gcuF-aadA2 cassette array, ISCR1, and qnrB2. bla(CTX-M-62) lies between intact and rearranged copies of ISEcp1 in a configuration that can be explained by a combination of transposition and homologous recombination and which also illustrates the ability of ISEcp1 to mobilize an adjacent gene as part of transposition units of different sizes.	0
Title: Streptococcus rattus strain BHT produces both a class I two-component lantibiotic and a class II bacteriocin Abstract: Streptococcus rattus strain BHT is a species representative and strong bacteriocin producer. Here we report that S. rattus BHT produces two quite different types of bacteriocin activity, named BHT-A and BHT-B. The two bacteriocins were purified and analysed for activity and by MALDI-TOF mass spectrophotometry. BHT-A was found to be a variant of the two-component lantibiotic, Smb. BHT-B is a non-modified 5195Da peptide with some similarity to the tryptophan-rich Staphylococcus aureus bacteriocin, aureocin A53. Six S. rattus and two S. mutans strains were found to contain both the BHT-A and BHT-B genetic loci.	1
Title: Nucleotide Binding Modes in a Motor Protein Revealed by 31 P- and 1 H-Detected MAS Solid-State NMR Spectroscopy Abstract: Protein-nucleic acid interactions play important roles not only in energy-providing reactions, such as ATP hydrolysis, but also in reading, extending, packaging, or repairing genomes. Although they can often be analyzed in detail with X-ray crystallography, complementary methods are needed to visualize them in complexes, which are not crystalline. Here, we show how solid-state NMR spectroscopy can detect and classify protein-nucleic interactions through site-specific 1 H- and 31 P-detected spectroscopic methods. The sensitivity of 1 H chemical-shift values on noncovalent interactions involved in these molecular recognition processes is exploited allowing us to probe directly the chemical bonding state, an information, which is not directly accessible from an X-ray structure. We show that these methods can characterize interactions in easy-to-prepare sediments of the 708 kDa dodecameric DnaB helicase in complex with ADP:AlF4- :DNA, and this despite the very challenging size of the complex.	0
Title: Characterization of a regulatory gene essential for the production of the angucycline-like polyketide antibiotic auricin in Streptomyces aureofaciens CCM 3239 Abstract: A gene, aur1P, encoding a protein similar to the response regulators of bacterial two-component signal transduction systems, was identified upstream of the aur1 polyketide gene cluster involved in biosynthesis of the angucycline-like antibiotic auricin in Streptomyces aureofaciens CCM 3239. Expression of the gene was directed by a single promoter, aur1Pp, which was transcribed at low levels during the exponential phase and induced just before the stationary phase. A divergently transcribed gene, aur1R, has been identified upstream of aur1P, encoding a protein homologous to transcriptional repressors of the TetR family. The aur1P gene was disrupted in the S. aureofaciens CCM 3239 chromosome by homologous recombination. The mutation in the aur1P gene had no effect on growth and differentiation. However, biochromatographic analysis of culture extracts from the S. aureofaciens aur1P-disrupted strain revealed that auricin was not produced in the mutant. This indicated that aur1P is essential for auricin production. Transcription from the previously characterized aur1Ap promoter, directing expression of the first gene, aur1A, in the auricin gene cluster, was dramatically decreased in the S. aureofaciens CCM 3239 aur1P mutant strain. Moreover, the Aur1P protein, overproduced in Escherichia coli, was shown to bind specifically upstream of the aur1Ap promoter region. The results indicated that the Aur1P regulator activates expression of the auricin biosynthesis genes.	1
Title: Towards reassigning the rare AGG codon in Escherichia coli Abstract: The rare AGG codon in Escherichia coli has been reassigned to code non-canonical amino acids (ncAAs) by using the PylRS-tRNA(Pyl)(CCU) pair. When N(ε) -alloc-lysine was used as a PylRS substrate, almost quantitative occupancy of N(ε) -alloc-lysine at an AGG codon site was achieved in minimal medium. ncAAs can be potentially incorporated at the AGG codon with varying efficiencies, depending on their activities towards corresponding enzymes. As AGG is a sense codon, the approach reported here resolves the typical low ncAA incorporation issue that has been associated with ncAA mutagenesis and therefore allows bulk preparation of proteins with site-selectively incorporated ncAAs for applications such as therapeutic protein production.	0
Title: Azotobacter vinelandii gene clusters for two types of peptidic and catechol siderophores produced in response to molybdenum Abstract: Aim:                       To characterize the complementary production of two types of siderophores in Azotobacter vinelandii.                  Methods and results:                       In an iron-insufficient environment, nitrogen-fixing A. vinelandii produces peptidic (azotobactin) and catechol siderophores for iron uptake to be used as a nitrogenase cofactor. Molybdenum, another nitrogenase cofactor, was also found to affect the production level of siderophores. Wild-type cells excreted azotobactin into molybdenum-supplemented and iron-insufficient medium, although catechol siderophores predominate in molybdenum-free environments. Two gene clusters were identified to be involved in the production of azotobactin and catechol siderophores through gene annotation and disruption. Azotobactin-deficient mutant cells produced catechol siderophores under the molybdenum-supplemented and iron-insufficient conditions, whereas catechol siderophore-deficient mutant cells extracellularly secreted excess azotobactin under iron-deficient condition independent of the concentration of molybdenum. This evidence suggests that a complementary siderophore production system exists in A. vinelandii.                  Conclusions:                       Molybdenum was found to regulate the production level of two types of siderophores. Azotobacter vinelandii cells are equipped with a complementary production system for nitrogen fixation in response to a limited quantity of metals.                  Significance and impact of the study:                       This is the first study identifying A. vinelandii gene clusters for the biosynthesis of two types of siderophores and clarifying the relationship between them.	1
Title: Organization of the biosynthetic gene cluster for the polyketide antitumor macrolide, pladienolide, in Streptomyces platensis Mer-11107 Abstract: Pladienolides are novel 12-membered macrolides produced by Streptomyces platensis Mer-11107. They show strong antitumor activity and are a potential lead in the search for novel antitumor agents. We sequenced the 65-kb region covering the biosynthetic gene cluster, and found four polyketide synthase genes (pldAI-pldAIV) composed of 11 modules, three genes involved in post-modifications (pldB-D), and a luxR-family regulatory gene (pldR). The thioesterase domain of pldAIV was more dissimilar to that of polyketide synthase systems synthesizing 12/14-membered macrolide polyketides than to that of systems synthesizing other cyclic polyketides. The pldB gene was identified as a 6-hydroxylase belonging to a cytochrome P450 of the CYP107 family. This was clarified by a disruption experiment on pldB, in which the disruptant produced 6-dehydroxy pladienolide B. Two genes located downstream of pldB, designated pldC and pldD, are thought to be a probable genes for 7-O-acetylase and 18, 19-epoxydase respectively.	1
Title: Co-linearity and divergence of the A subgenome of Brassica juncea compared with other Brassica species carrying different A subgenomes Abstract: Background:                       There are three basic Brassica genomes (A, B, and C) and three parallel sets of subgenomes distinguished in the diploid Brassica (i.e.: B. rapa, A(r)A(r); B. nigra, B(ni)B(ni); B. oleracea, C(o)C(o)) and the derived allotetraploid species (i.e.: B. juncea, A(j)A(j)B(j)B(j); B. napus, A(n)A(n)C(n)C(n); B. carinata, B(c)B(c)C(c)C(c)). To understand subgenome differentiation in B. juncea in comparison to other A genome-carrying Brassica species (B. rapa and B. napus), we constructed a dense genetic linkage map of B. juncea, and conducted population genetic analysis on diverse lines of the three A-genome carrying Brassica species using a genotyping-by-sequencing approach (DArT-seq).                  Results:                       A dense genetic linkage map of B. juncea was constructed using an F2 population derived from Sichuan Yellow/Purple Mustard. The map included 3329 DArT-seq markers on 18 linkage groups and covered 1579 cM with an average density of two markers per cM. Based on this map and the alignment of the marker sequences with the physical genome of Arabidopsis thaliana, we observed strong co-linearity of the ancestral blocks among the different A subgenomes but also considerable block variation. Comparative analyses at the level of genome sequences of B. rapa and B. napus, and marker sequence anchored on the genetic map of B. juncea, revealed a total of 30 potential inversion events across large segments and 20 potential translocation events among the three A subgenomes. Population genetic analysis on 26 accessions of the three A genome-carrying Brassica species showed that the highest genetic distance were estimated when comparing A(j)-A(n) than between A(n)-A(r) and A(j)-A(r) subgenome pairs.                  Conclusions:                       The development of the dense genetic linkage map of B. juncea with informative DArT-seq marker sequences and availability of the reference sequences of the A(r), and A(n)C(n) genomes allowed us to compare the A subgenome structure of B. juncea (A(j)) . Our results suggest that strong co-linearity exists among the three A Brassica genomes (A(r), A(n) and A(j)) but with apparent subgenomic variation. Population genetic analysis on three A-genome carrying Brassica species support the idea that B. juncea has distinct genomic diversity, and/or evolved from a different A genome progenitor of B. napus.	0
Title: Automated genome mining of ribosomal peptide natural products Abstract: Ribosomally synthesized and posttranslationally modified peptides (RiPPs), especially from microbial sources, are a large group of bioactive natural products that are a promising source of new (bio)chemistry and bioactivity.1 In light of exponentially increasing microbial genome databases and improved mass spectrometry (MS)-based metabolomic platforms, there is a need for computational tools that connect natural product genotypes predicted from microbial genome sequences with their corresponding chemotypes from metabolomic data sets. Here, we introduce RiPPquest, a tandem mass spectrometry database search tool for identification of microbial RiPPs, and apply it to lanthipeptide discovery. RiPPquest uses genomics to limit search space to the vicinity of RiPP biosynthetic genes and proteomics to analyze extensive peptide modifications and compute p-values of peptide-spectrum matches (PSMs). We highlight RiPPquest by connecting multiple RiPPs from extracts of Streptomyces to their gene clusters and by the discovery of a new class III lanthipeptide, informatipeptin, from Streptomyces viridochromogenes DSM 40736 to reflect that it is a natural product that was discovered by mass spectrometry based genome mining using algorithmic tools rather than manual inspection of mass spectrometry data and genetic information. The presented tool is available at cyclo.ucsd.edu.	1
Title: Activity screening of carrier domains within nonribosomal peptide synthetases using complex substrate mixtures and large molecule mass spectrometry Abstract: For screening a pool of potential substrates that load carrier domains found in nonribosomal peptide synthetases, large molecule mass spectrometry is shown to be a new, unbiased assay. Combining the high resolving power of Fourier transform mass spectrometry with the ability of adenylation domains to select their own substrates, the mass change that takes place upon formation of a covalent intermediate thus identifies the substrate. This assay has an advantage over traditional radiochemical assays in that many substrates, the substrate pool, can be screened simultaneously. Using proteins on the nikkomycin, clorobiocin, coumermycin A1, yersiniabactin, pyochelin, and enterobactin biosynthetic pathways as proof of principle, preferred substrates are readily identified from substrate pools. Furthermore, this assay can be used to provide insight into the timing of tailoring events of biosynthetic pathways as demonstrated using the bromination reaction found on the jamaicamide biosynthetic pathway. Finally, this assay can provide insight into the role and function of orphan gene clusters for which the encoded natural product is unknown. This is demonstrated by identifying the substrates for two NRPS modules from the pksN and pksJ genes that are found on an orphan NRPS/PKS hybrid cluster from Bacillus subtilis. This new assay format is especially timely for activity screening in an era when new types of thiotemplate assembly lines that defy classification are being discovered at an accelerating rate.	1
Title: A pathway-specific transcriptional activator regulates late steps of clavulanic acid biosynthesis in Streptomyces clavuligerus Abstract: A Streptomyces clavuligerus gene (designated claR) located downstream from the gene encoding clavaminate synthase in the clavulanic acid biosynthetic gene cluster is involved in regulation of the late steps in clavulanic acid biosynthesis. Nucleotide sequence analysis and database searching of ClaR identified a significant similarity to the helix-turn-helix motif (HTH) region of LysR transcriptional regulators. A gene replacement mutant disrupted in claR was unable to produce clavulanic acid, suggesting that claR is essential for clavulanic acid biosynthesis. Furthermore, the accumulation of clavaminic acid in the claR mutant suggested that ClaR regulates the late steps in the clavulanic acid pathway, i.e. those involved in the conversion of clavaminic acid to clavulanic acid. Transcriptional analysis using RNA isolated from the wild type and the claR mutant showed that the expression of the putative late genes, but not the early genes, was regulated by ClaR. High-resolution S1 nuclease analysis of claR suggested that it is expressed as a monocistronic transcript and also as a bicistronic transcript along with the late gene orf-9. The transcription start site of the monocistronic claR transcript was identified as a C residue 155 nucleotides upstream from the claR start codon.	1
Title: Discovery and Elucidation of the Biosynthesis of Aspernidgulenes: Novel Polyenes from Aspergillus Nidulans by Using Serial Promoter Replacement Abstract: Through serial promoter exchanges, we isolated several novel polyenes, the aspernidgulenes, from Aspergillus nidulans and uncovered their succinct biosynthetic pathway involving only four enzymes. An enoyl reductase (ER)-less highly reducing polyketide synthase (HR-PKS) putatively produces a 5,6-dihydro-α-pyrone polyene, which undergoes bisepoxidation, epoxide ring opening, cyclization, and hydrolytic cleavage by three tailoring enzymes to generate aspernidgulene A1 and A2. Our findings demonstrate the prowess of fungal-tailoring enzymes to transform a polyketide scaffold concisely and efficiently into complex structures. Moreover, comparison with citreoviridin and aurovertin biosynthesis suggests that methylation of the α-pyrone hydroxy group by methyltransferase (CtvB or AurB) is the branching point at which the biosynthesis of these two classes of compounds diverge. Therefore, scanning for the presence or absence of the gatekeeping α-pyrone methyltransferase gene in homologous clusters might be a potential way to classify the product bioinformatically as belonging to methylated α-pyrone polyenes or polyenes containing rings derived from the cyclization of the unmethylated 5,6-dihydro-α-pyrone, such as 2,3-dimethyl-γ-lactone and oxabicyclo[2.2.1]heptane.	1
Title: Microbe Profile: Euglena gracilis: photogenic, flexible and hardy Abstract: Euglena gracilis is a unicellular photosynthetic eukaryotic flagellate of the Discoba supergroup, which also encompasses Kinetoplastida and Diplonema. Plastids have green algal origin and are secondarily acquired. The nuclear genome is extremely large and many genes suggest multiple endosymbiotic/gene transfer events, i.e. derivation from prokaryotes of various lineages. E. gracilis is remarkably robust and can proliferate in environments contaminated with heavy metals and acids. Extraordinary metabolic plasticity and a mixotrophic lifestyle confers an ability to thrive in a broad range of environments, as well as facilitating production of many novel metabolites, making Euglena of considerable biotechnological importance.	0
Title: An indigoidine biosynthetic gene cluster from Streptomyces chromofuscus ATCC 49982 contains an unusual IndB homologue Abstract: A putative indigoidine biosynthetic gene cluster was located in the genome of Streptomyces chromofuscus ATCC 49982. The silent 9.4-kb gene cluster consists of five open reading frames, named orf1, Sc-indC, Sc-indA, Sc-indB, and orf2, respectively. Sc-IndC was functionally characterized as an indigoidine synthase through heterologous expression of the enzyme in both Streptomyces coelicolor CH999 and Escherichia coli BAP1. The yield of indigoidine in E. coli BAP1 reached 2.78 g/l under the optimized conditions. The predicted protein product of Sc-indB is unusual and much larger than any other reported IndB-like protein. The N-terminal portion of this enzyme resembles IdgB and the C-terminal portion is a hypothetical protein. Sc-IndA and/or Sc-IndB were co-expressed with Sc-IndC in E. coli BAP1, which demonstrated the involvement of Sc-IndB, but not Sc-IndA, in the biosynthetic pathway of indigoidine. The yield of indigoidine was dramatically increased by 41.4 % (3.93 g/l) when Sc-IndB was co-expressed with Sc-IndC in E. coli BAP1. Indigoidine is more stable at low temperatures.	1
Title: Methylsulfonyl benzothiazole (MSBT): a selective protein thiol blocking reagent Abstract: A new thiol blocking reagent, methylsulfonyl benzothiazole, was discovered. This reagent showed good selectivity and high reactivity for protein thiols.	0
Title: Isolation of the lysolipin gene cluster of Streptomyces tendae Tü 4042 Abstract: Streptomyces tendae Tü 4042 produces the aromatic polyketide antibiotic lysolipin. Lysolipin has strong antibacterial activity against a variety of multidrug-resistant pathogens. The complete lysolipin biosynthetic gene cluster was isolated and fully sequenced. Within a 42-kb genomic region, 42 genes were identified that code for a type II polyketide synthase (llpF, E, and D), cyclases (llpCI-CIII), methyltransferases (llpMI-MVI), a halogenase (llpH), an amidotransferase (llpA), a ferredoxin (llpK), a transporter (llpN) and regulatory proteins (llpRI-RV). In addition, 15 genes encoding enzymes involved in redox modifications of the polyketide precursor molecule (llpOI-OVIII, ZI-ZIV, U, L, and S) were present in the lysolipin biosynthetic gene cluster. With this high number of oxidoreductases, lysolipin is among the most highly modified aromatic polyketides known to date. The heterologous expression of the cluster in Streptomyces albus led to lysolipin production with a yield comparable to that of wild-type, indicating that all biosynthetic genes were successfully cloned.	1
Title: Catalytic Synthesis of 1 H-2-Benzoxocins: Cobalt(III)-Carbene Radical Approach to 8-Membered Heterocyclic Enol Ethers Abstract: The metallo-radical activation of ortho-allylcarbonyl-aryl N-arylsulfonylhydrazones with the paramagnetic cobalt(II) porphyrin catalyst [CoII(TPP)] (TPP = tetraphenylporphyrin) provides an efficient and powerful method for the synthesis of novel 8-membered heterocyclic enol ethers. The synthetic protocol is versatile and practical and enables the synthesis of a wide range of unique 1H-2-benzoxocins in high yields. The catalytic cyclization reactions proceed with excellent chemoselectivities, have a high functional group tolerance, and provide several opportunities for the synthesis of new bioactive compounds. The reactions are shown to proceed via cobalt(III)-carbene radical intermediates, which are involved in intramolecular hydrogen transfer (HAT) from the allylic position to the carbene radical, followed by a near-barrierless radical rebound step in the coordination sphere of cobalt. The proposed mechanism is supported by experimental observations, density functional theory (DFT) calculations, and spin trapping experiments.	0
Title: Mechanistic insight with HBCH2CoA as a probe to polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) synthases Abstract: Polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) synthases catalyze the polymerization of 3-(R)-hydroxybutyrate coenzyme A (HBCoA) to produce polyoxoesters of 1-2 MDa. A substrate analogue HBCH2CoA, in which the S in HBCoA is replaced with a CH2 group, was synthesized in 13 steps using a chemoenzymatic approach in a 7.5% overall yield. Kinetic studies reveal it is a competitive inhibitor of a class I and a class III PHB synthases, with Kis of 40 and 14 μM, respectively. To probe the elongation steps of the polymerization, HBCH2CoA was incubated with a synthase acylated with a [(3)H]-saturated trimer-CoA ([(3)H]-sTCoA). The products of the reaction were shown to be the methylene analogue of [(3)H]-sTCoA ([(3)H]-sT-CH2-CoA), saturated dimer-([(3)H]-sD-CO2H), and trimer-acid ([(3)H]-sT-CO2H), distinct from the expected methylene analogue of [(3)H]-saturated tetramer-CoA ([(3)H]-sTet-CH2-CoA). Detection of [(3)H]-sT-CH2-CoA and its slow rate of formation suggest that HBCH2CoA may be reporting on the termination and repriming process of the synthases, rather than elongation.	0
Title: Antifungal hydrogels Abstract: Fungi are increasingly identified as major pathogens in bloodstream infections, often involving indwelling devices. Materials with antifungal properties may provide an important deterrent to these infections. Here we describe amphogel, a dextran-based hydrogel into which amphotericin B is adsorbed. Amphogel kills fungi within 2 h of contact and can be reused for at least 53 days without losing its effectiveness against Candida albicans. The antifungal material is biocompatible in vivo and does not cause hemolysis in human blood. Amphogel inoculated with C. albicans and implanted in mice prevents fungal infection. Amphogel also mitigates fungal biofilm formation. An antifungal matrix with these properties could be used to coat a variety of medical devices such as catheters as well as industrial surfaces.	0
Title: Expression analysis of the colibactin gene cluster coding for a novel polyketide in Escherichia coli Abstract: The recently described hybrid nonribosomal peptide-polyketide colibactin, found in various Escherichia coli strains, invokes a cytopathic effect in HeLa cells upon cocultivation with these bacteria. However, not much is known so far about the transcriptional organization of the colibactin genes (clb) or the regulation of their transcription. Here, the operon structure of the colibactin gene cluster of E. coli strain Nissle 1917 was investigated by means of reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR and seven transcripts were found of which four are transcribed polycistronically. The polycistrons comprise the genes clbC to clbG, clbI to clbN, clbO to clbP, and clbR to clbA and span 6.3, 23.3, 3.9, and 0.9 kb, respectively. Furthermore, transcript levels for different cultivation conditions were determined by RT-PCR of the whole cluster as well as by luciferase reporter gene assays of the genes clbA, clbB, clbQ, and clbR. RT-PCR revealed an overall increased transcription in shaking cultures as well as of the genes clbA to clbH in general. Luciferase reporter gene fusions indicated an influence of the carbon source on clb gene expression.	1
Title: Characterization of the maduropeptin biosynthetic gene cluster from Actinomadura madurae ATCC 39144 supporting a unifying paradigm for enediyne biosynthesis Abstract: The biosynthetic gene cluster for the enediyne antitumor antibiotic maduropeptin (MDP) from Actinomadura madurae ATCC 39144 was cloned and sequenced. Cloning of the mdp gene cluster was confirmed by heterologous complementation of enediyne polyketide synthase (PKS) mutants from the C-1027 producer Streptomyces globisporus and the neocarzinostatin producer Streptomyces carzinostaticus using the MDP enediyne PKS and associated genes. Furthermore, MDP was produced, and its apoprotein was isolated and N-terminal sequenced; the encoding gene, mdpA, was found to reside within the cluster. The biosynthesis of MDP is highlighted by two iterative type I PKSs--the enediyne PKS and a 6-methylsalicylic acid PKS; generation of (S)-3-(2-chloro-3-hydroxy-4-methoxyphenyl)-3-hydroxypropionic acid derived from L-alpha-tyrosine; a unique type of enediyne apoprotein; and a convergent biosynthetic approach to the final MDP chromophore. The results demonstrate a platform for engineering new enediynes by combinatorial biosynthesis and establish a unified paradigm for the biosynthesis of enediyne polyketides.	1
Title: Protective effect of probiotics on Salmonella infectivity assessed with combined in vitro gut fermentation-cellular models Abstract: Background:                       Accurate assessment of probiotics with targeted anti-Salmonella activity requires suitable models accounting for both, microbe-microbe and host-microbe interactions in gut environments. Here we report the combination of two original in vitro intestinal models closely mimicking the complex in vivo conditions of the large intestine. Effluents from continuous in vitro three-stage fermentation colonic models of Salmonella Typhimurium infection inoculated with immobilized child microbiota and Salmonella were directly applied to confluent mucus-secreting HT29-MTX cell layers. The effects of Salmonella, addition of two bacteriocinogenic strains, Bifidobacterium thermophilum RBL67 (thermophilicin B67) and Escherichia coli L1000 (microcin B17), and inulin were tested on Salmonella growth and interactions with epithelial cell layers. Salmonella adhesion and invasion were investigated and epithelial integrity assessed by transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) measurements and confocal microscopy observation. Data from complex effluents were compared with pure Salmonella cultures.                  Results:                       Salmonella in effluents of all reactors of the colonic fermentation model stabilized at mean values of 5.3 ± 0.8 log10 cfu/ml effluent. Invasion of cell-associated Salmonella was up to 50-fold lower in complex reactor samples compared to pure Salmonella cultures. It further depended on environmental factors, with 0.2 ± 0.1% being measured with proximal, 0.6 ± 0.2% with transverse and 1.3 ± 0.7% with distal reactor effluents, accompanied by a similar high decrease of TER across cell monolayers (minus 45%) and disruption of tight junctions. Subsequent addition of E. coli L1000 stimulated Salmonella growth (6.4 ± 0.6 log10 cfu/ml effluent of all 3 reactors) and further decreased TER, but led to 10-fold decreased invasion efficiency when tested with distal reactor samples. In contrast, presence of B. thermophilum RBL67 revealed a protective effect on epithelial integrity compared to previous E. coli L1000 periods, as reflected by a significant mean increase of TER by 58% in all reactors. Inulin addition enhanced Salmonella growth and invasion when tested with distal and proximal reactor samples, respectively, but induced a limited decrease of TER (minus 18%) in all reactors.                  Conclusions:                       Our results highlight the benefits of combining suitable cellular and colonic fermentation models to assess strain-specific first-level host protection properties of probiotics during Salmonella infection, providing an efficient system biology tool for preclinical development of new antimicrobials.	0
Title: A solute-binding protein for iron transport in Streptococcus iniae Abstract: Background:                       Streptococcus iniae (S. iniae) is a major pathogen that causes considerable morbidity and mortality in cultured fish worldwide. The pathogen's ability to adapt to the host affects the extent of infection, hence understanding the mechanisms by which S. iniae overcomes physiological stresses during infection will help to identify potential virulence determinants of streptococcal infection. Grow S. iniae under iron-restricted conditions is one approach for identifying host-specific protein expression. Iron plays an important role in many biological processes but it has low solubility under physiological condition. Many microorganisms have been shown to be able to circumvent this nutritional limitation by forming direct contacts with iron-containing proteins through ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters. The ABC transporter superfamilies constitute many different systems that are widespread among living organisms with different functions, such as ligands translocation, mRNA translation, and DNA repair.                  Results:                       An ABC transporter system, named as mtsABC (metal transport system) was cloned from S. iniae HD-1, and was found to be involved in heme utilization. mtsABC is cotranscribed by three downstream genes, i.e., mtsA, mtsB, and mtsC. In this study, we cloned the first gene of the mtsABC transporter system (mtsA), and purified the corresponding recombinant protein MtsA. The analysis indicated that MtsA is a putative lipoprotein which binds to heme that can serve as an iron source for the microorganism, and is expressed in vivo during Kunming mice infection by S. iniae HD-1.                  Conclusions:                       This is believed to be the first report on the cloning the ABC transporter lipoprotein from S. iniae genomic DNA. Together, our data suggested that MtsA is associated with heme, and is expressed in vivo during Kunming mice infection by S. iniae HD-1 which indicated that it can be a potential candidate for S. iniae subunit vaccine.	0
Title: Lantibiotics from Geobacillus thermodenitrificans Abstract: The lantibiotic nisin has been used as an effective food preservative to combat food-borne pathogens for over 40 y. Despite this successful use, nisin's stability at pH 7 is limited. Herein, we describe a nisin analog encoded on the genome of the thermophilic bacterium Geobacillus thermodenitrificans NG80-2. This analog termed geobacillin I was obtained by heterologous expression in Escherichia coli and subsequent purification. Extensive NMR characterization demonstrated that geobacillin I contains seven thioether cross-links, two more than the five cross-links found in nisin and the most cross-links found in any lantibiotic to date. The antimicrobial spectrum of geobacillin I was generally similar to that of nisin A, with increased activity against Streptococcus dysgalactiae, one of the causative agents of bovine mastitis. Geobacillin I demonstrated increased stability compared to nisin A. In addition to geobacillin I, the genome of G. thermodenitrificans NG80-2 also contains a class II lantibiotic biosynthetic gene cluster. The corresponding compound was produced in E. coli, and has a ring topology different than that of any known lantibiotic as determined by tandem mass spectrometry. Interestingly, geobacillin II only demonstrated antimicrobial activity against Bacillus strains. Seven Geobacillus strains were screened for production of the geobacillins using whole-cell MALDI-MS and five were shown to produce geobacillin I, but none produced geobacillin II.	1
Title: New Vocabulary for Bacterial Communication Abstract: Quorum sensing (QS) is widely accepted as a procedure that bacteria use to converse. However, prevailing thinking places acyl homoserine lactones (AHLs) at the forefront of this communication pathway in Gram-negative bacteria. With the advent of high-throughput genomics and the subsequent influx of bacterial genomes, bioinformatics analysis has determined that the genes encoding AHL biosynthesis, originally discovered to be indispensable for QS (LuxI-like proteins and homologues), are often absent in QS-capable bacteria. Instead, the sensing protein (LuxR-like proteins) is present with an apparent inability to produce any outgoing AHL signal. Recently, several signals for these LuxR solos have been identified. Herein, advances in the field of QS are discussed, with a particular focus on recent research in the field of bacterial cell-cell communication.	0
Title: Modelling of photosynthesis, respiration, and nutrient yield coefficients in Scenedemus almeriensis culture as a function of nitrogen and phosphorus Abstract: Photo-respirometric tecniques are applied for evaluating photosynthetic activity in phototrophic organisms. These methods allow to evaluate photosynthetic response under different conditions. In this work, the influence of nutrient availability (nitrate, ammonium, and phosphate) on the photosynthesis and respiration of Scenedesmus almeriensis was studied using short photo-respirometric measurements. Both photosynthesis and respiration increasing until saturation value and consecutively diminishing, presenting inhibition by high concentrations. Regarding the influence of phosphorus concentration in microalgae cells, a similar hyperbolic trend was observed but no inhibition was observed at high concentration. Based on these experimental data, the respiration, and the photosynthesis rate of S. almeriensis were modelled using Haldane equation for nitrate and ammonium data, and Monod equation for phosphate data. In addition, experiments were performed to determine the yield coefficients for both nitrogen and phosphorus in S. almeriensis cultures. The data showed that the nitrogen and phosphorous coefficient yields are not constant, being modified as a function of nutrients concentration, presenting the luxury uptake phenomena. Finally, the proposed models were incorporated into a simulation tool to evaluate the photosynthetic activity and the nutrient yield coefficients of S. almeriensis when different culture media and wastewaters are used as a nitrogen and phosphorous source for its growth. Key points • Microalgal photosynthesis/respiration vary as a function of nutrients availability. • Photosynthesis inhibition appears at high N-NO 3 - and N-NH4+ concentrations. • Nutrient yield coefficients are influenced by luxury uptake phenomenon.	0
Title: Constructing de novo H2O2 signaling via induced protein proximity Abstract: A new chemical strategy has been developed to generate de novo signaling pathways that link a signaling molecule, H2O2, to different downstream cellular events in mammalian cells. This approach combines the reactivity-based H2O2 sensing with the chemically induced protein proximity technology. By chemically modifying abscisic acid with an H2O2-sensitive boronate ester probe, novel H2O2 signaling pathways can be engineered to induce transcription, protein translocation and membrane ruffle formation upon exogenous or endogenous H2O2 stimulation. This strategy has also been successfully applied to gibberellic acid, which provides the potential to build signaling networks based on orthogonal cell stimuli.	0
Title: Possible transmission of Streptococcus iniae from wild fish to cultured marine fish Abstract: Streptococcus iniae was isolated from diseased wild fish collected near a mariculture facility where gilthead sea bream and European sea bass exhibited a similar infection. Species-specific PCR and ribotyping confirmed that wild and cultured fish were infected by a single S. iniae clone. Wild fish are therefore potential amplifiers of pathogenic S. iniae strains.	0
Title: Saccharochelins A-H, Cytotoxic Amphiphilic Siderophores from the Rare Marine Actinomycete Saccharothrix sp. D09 Abstract: Siderophores are secreted by microorganisms to survive in iron-depleted conditions, and they also possess tremendous therapeutic potential. Genomic-inspired isolation facilitated the identification of eight amphiphilic siderophores, saccharochelins A-H (1-8), from a rare marine-derived Saccharothrix species. Saccharochelins feature a series of fatty acyl groups appended to the same tetrapeptide skeleton. With the help of gene disruption and heterologous expression, we identified the saccharochelin biosynthetic pathway. The diversity of saccharochelins originates from the flexible specificity of the starter condensation (CS) domain at the beginning of the nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) toward various fatty acyl substrates. Saccharochelins showed cytotoxicity against several human tumor cell lines, with IC50 values ranging from 2.3 to 17 μM. Additionally, the fatty acid side chains of the saccharochelins remarkably affected the cytotoxicity, suggesting changing the N-terminal acyl groups of lipopeptides may be a promising approach to produce more potent derivatives.	1
Title: Pressure-tuning the quantum spin Hamiltonian of the triangular lattice antiferromagnet Cs2CuCl4 Abstract: Quantum triangular-lattice antiferromagnets are important prototype systems to investigate numerous phenomena of the geometrical frustration in condensed matter. Apart from highly unusual magnetic properties, they possess a rich phase diagram (ranging from an unfrustrated square lattice to a quantum spin liquid), yet to be confirmed experimentally. One major obstacle in this area of research is the lack of materials with appropriate (ideally tuned) magnetic parameters. Using Cs2CuCl4 as a model system, we demonstrate an alternative approach, where, instead of the chemical composition, the spin Hamiltonian is altered by hydrostatic pressure. The approach combines high-pressure electron spin resonance and r.f. susceptibility measurements, allowing us not only to quasi-continuously tune the exchange parameters, but also to accurately monitor them. Our experiments indicate a substantial increase of the exchange coupling ratio from 0.3 to 0.42 at a pressure of 1.8 GPa, revealing a number of emergent field-induced phases.	0
Title: Guttation capsules containing hydrogen peroxide: an evolutionarily conserved NADPH oxidase gains a role in wars between related fungi Abstract: When resources are limited, the hypocrealean fungus Trichoderma guizhouense can overgrow another hypocrealean fungus Fusarium oxysporum, cause sporadic cell death and arrest growth. A transcriptomic analysis of this interaction shows that T. guizhouense undergoes a succession of metabolic stresses while F. oxysporum responded relatively neutrally but used the constitutive expression of several toxin-encoding genes as a protective strategy. Because of these toxins, T. guizhouense cannot approach it is potential host on the substrate surface and attacks F. oxysporum from above. The success of T. guizhouense is secured by the excessive production of hydrogen peroxide (H2 O2 ), which is stored in microscopic bag-like guttation droplets hanging on the contacting hyphae. The deletion of NADPH oxidase nox1 and its regulator, nor1 in T. guizhouense led to a substantial decrease in H2 O2 formation with concomitant loss of antagonistic activity. We envision the role of NOX proteins in the antagonism of T. guizhouense as an example of metabolic exaptation evolved in this fungus because the primary function of these ancient proteins was probably not linked to interfungal relationships. In support of this, F. oxysporum showed almost no transcriptional response to T. guizhouense Δnox1 strain indicating the role of NOX/H2 O2 in signalling and fungal communication.	0
Title: Amylocyclicin, a novel circular bacteriocin produced by Bacillus amyloliquefaciens FZB42 Abstract: Bacillus amyloliquefaciens FZB42 is a Gram-positive plant growth-promoting bacterium with an impressive capacity to synthesize nonribosomal secondary metabolites with antimicrobial activity. Here we report on a novel circular bacteriocin which is ribosomally synthesized by FZB42. The compound displayed high antibacterial activity against closely related Gram-positive bacteria. Transposon mutagenesis and subsequent site-specific mutagenesis combined with matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectroscopy revealed that a cluster of six genes covering 4,490 bp was responsible for the production, modification, and export of and immunity to an antibacterial compound, here designated amylocyclicin, with a molecular mass of 6,381 Da. Peptide sequencing of the fragments obtained after tryptic digestion of the purified peptide revealed posttranslational cleavage of an N-terminal extension and head-to-tail circularization of the novel bacteriocin. Homology to other putative circular bacteriocins in related bacteria let us assume that this type of peptide is widespread among the Bacillus/Paenibacillus taxon.	1
Title: Dendritic growth gated by a steroid hormone receptor underlies increases in activity in the developing Drosophila locomotor system Abstract: As animals grow, their nervous systems also increase in size. How growth in the central nervous system is regulated and its functional consequences are incompletely understood. We explored these questions, using the larval Drosophila locomotor system as a model. In the periphery, at neuromuscular junctions, motoneurons are known to enlarge their presynaptic axon terminals in size and strength, thereby compensating for reductions in muscle excitability that are associated with increases in muscle size. Here, we studied how motoneurons change in the central nervous system during periods of animal growth. We find that within the central nervous system motoneurons also enlarge their postsynaptic dendritic arbors, by the net addition of branches, and that these scale with overall animal size. This dendritic growth is gated on a cell-by-cell basis by a specific isoform of the steroid hormone receptor ecdysone receptor-B2, for which functions have thus far remained elusive. The dendritic growth is accompanied by synaptic strengthening and results in increased neuronal activity. Electrical properties of these neurons, however, are independent of ecdysone receptor-B2 regulation. We propose that these structural dendritic changes in the central nervous system, which regulate neuronal activity, constitute an additional part of the adaptive response of the locomotor system to increases in body and muscle size as the animal grows.	0
Title: Selective Neutral pH Inhibitor of Cathepsin B Designed Based on Cleavage Preferences at Cytosolic and Lysosomal pH Conditions Abstract: Cathepsin B is a cysteine protease that normally functions within acidic lysosomes for protein degradation, but in numerous human diseases, cathepsin B translocates to the cytosol having neutral pH where the enzyme activates inflammation and cell death. Cathepsin B is active at both the neutral pH 7.2 of the cytosol and the acidic pH 4.6 within lysosomes. We evaluated the hypothesis that cathepsin B may possess pH-dependent cleavage preferences that can be utilized for design of a selective neutral pH inhibitor by (1) analysis of differential cathepsin B cleavage profiles at neutral pH compared to acidic pH using multiplex substrate profiling by mass spectrometry (MSP-MS), (2) design of pH-selective peptide-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (AMC) substrates, and (3) design and validation of Z-Arg-Lys-acyloxymethyl ketone (AOMK) as a selective neutral pH inhibitor. Cathepsin B displayed preferences for cleaving peptides with Arg in the P2 position at pH 7.2 and Glu in the P2 position at pH 4.6, represented by its primary dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase and modest endopeptidase activity. These properties led to design of the substrate Z-Arg-Lys-AMC having neutral pH selectivity, and its modification with the AOMK warhead to result in the inhibitor Z-Arg-Lys-AOMK. This irreversible inhibitor displays nanomolar potency with 100-fold selectivity for inhibition of cathepsin B at pH 7.2 compared to pH 4.6, shows specificity for cathepsin B over other cysteine cathepsins, and is cell permeable and inhibits intracellular cathepsin B. These findings demonstrate that cathepsin B possesses pH-dependent cleavage properties that can lead to development of a potent, neutral pH inhibitor of this enzyme.	0
Title: Moving posttranslational modifications forward to biosynthesize the glycosylated thiopeptide nocathiacin I in Nocardia sp. ATCC202099 Abstract: Characterization of the biosynthetic gene cluster of glycosylated antibiotic nocathiacin I (NOC-I) here adds new insights to thiopeptide biosynthesis, showing the NOC-specific tailoring and unusual sugar formation. NOC-I biosynthesis shares the paradigm for forming a common thiopeptide core and the generality for converting to an e series member, as that of the parent compound nosiheptide (NOS). This may permit the production of NOC-I in the genetically amenable, NOS-producing strain by building NOC-specific genes for pathway engineering.	1
Title: The Phormidolide Biosynthetic Gene Cluster: A trans-AT PKS Pathway Encoding a Toxic Macrocyclic Polyketide Abstract: Phormidolide is a polyketide produced by a cultured filamentous marine cyanobacterium and incorporates a 16-membered macrolactone. Its complex structure is recognizably derived from a polyketide synthase pathway, but possesses unique and intriguing structural features that prompted interest in investigating its biosynthetic origin. Stable isotope incorporation experiments confirmed the polyketide nature of this compound. We further characterized the phormidolide gene cluster (phm) through genome sequencing followed by bioinformatic analysis. Two discrete trans-type acyltransferase (trans-AT) ORFs along with KS-AT adaptor regions (ATd) within the polyketide synthase (PKS) megasynthases, suggest that the phormidolide gene cluster is a trans-AT PKS. Insights gained from analysis of the mode of acetate incorporation and ensuing keto reduction prompted our reevaluation of the stereochemistry of phormidolide hydroxy groups located along the linear polyketide chain.	1
Title: Cognitive requirements of cumulative culture: teaching is useful but not essential Abstract: The cumulative nature of human culture is unique in the animal kingdom. Progressive improvements in tools and technologies have facilitated humanity's spread across the globe and shaped human evolution, but the cognitive mechanisms enabling cultural change remain unclear. Here we show that, contrary to theoretical predictions, cumulative improvements in tools are not dependent on specialised, high-fidelity social learning mechanisms. Participants were tasked with building a basket to carry as much rice as possible using a set of everyday materials and divided into treatment groups with differing opportunities to learn asocially, imitate, receive teaching or emulate by examining baskets made by previous chain members. Teaching chains produced more robust baskets, but neither teaching nor imitation were strictly necessary for cumulative improvements; emulation chains generated equivalent increases in efficacy despite exhibiting relatively low copying fidelity. People used social information strategically, choosing different materials to make their baskets if the previous basket in the chain performed poorly. Together, these results suggest that cumulative culture does not rest on high-fidelity social learning mechanisms alone. Instead, the roots of human cultural prowess may lie in the interplay of strategic social learning with other cognitive traits including the ability to reverse engineer artefacts through causal reasoning.	0
Title: Glutathione boosting the cytotoxicity of a magnetic platinum(iv) nano-prodrug in tumor cells Abstract: Superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) are potential vehicles for targeted drug delivery and viable contrast agents for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). A PtIV prodrug (HSPt) derived from functionalization of cisplatin with hydroxyl and succinate is conjugated with a poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)-modified SPION for cancer therapy and monitoring of therapeutic responses. The relaxivity of HSPt-PEG-SPIONs is larger than that of commercial contrast agent Feridex, and a tumor-selective negative contrast is observed in MRI in a magnetic field. HSPt-PEG-SPIONs can be dissociated and reduced into PtII species by glutathione (GSH). Instead of forming DNA-Pt crosslinks, the reduced product induces direct DNA single- or double-strand breaks, which is uncommon for Pt drugs. The cytotoxicity of HSPt-PEG-SPIONs is positively correlated with the GSH level of tumor cells, which is opposite to the scenario of current Pt drugs. HSPt-PEG-SPIONs are as cytotoxic as cisplatin against cancer cells but are almost nontoxic towards normal cells. Since the mechanism of action of the nanocomposite is different from the established paradigm for Pt drugs, it may become a special theranostic agent for cancer treatment.	0
Title: Halorhabdus tiamatea: proteogenomics and glycosidase activity measurements identify the first cultivated euryarchaeon from a deep-sea anoxic brine lake as potential polysaccharide degrader Abstract: Euryarchaea from the genus Halorhabdus have been found in hypersaline habitats worldwide, yet are represented by only two isolates: Halorhabdus utahensis AX-2(T) from the shallow Great Salt Lake of Utah, and Halorhabdus tiamatea SARL4B(T) from the Shaban deep-sea hypersaline anoxic lake (DHAL) in the Red Sea. We sequenced the H. tiamatea genome to elucidate its niche adaptations. Among sequenced archaea, H. tiamatea features the highest number of glycoside hydrolases, the majority of which were expressed in proteome experiments. Annotations and glycosidase activity measurements suggested an adaptation towards recalcitrant algal and plant-derived hemicelluloses. Glycosidase activities were higher at 2% than at 0% or 5% oxygen, supporting a preference for low-oxygen conditions. Likewise, proteomics indicated quinone-mediated electron transport at 2% oxygen, but a notable stress response at 5% oxygen. Halorhabdus tiamatea furthermore encodes proteins characteristic for thermophiles and light-dependent enzymes (e.g. bacteriorhodopsin), suggesting that H. tiamatea evolution was mostly not governed by a cold, dark, anoxic deep-sea habitat. Using enrichment and metagenomics, we could demonstrate presence of similar glycoside hydrolase-rich Halorhabdus members in the Mediterranean DHAL Medee, which supports that Halorhabdus species can occupy a distinct niche as polysaccharide degraders in hypersaline environments.	0
Title: Identification and catalytic characterization of a nonribosomal peptide synthetase-like (NRPS-like) enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of echosides from Streptomyces sp. LZ35 Abstract: Echosides, isolated from Streptomyces sp. LZ35, represent a class of para-terphenyl natural products that display DNA topoisomerase I and IIα inhibitory activities. By analyzing the genome draft of strain LZ35, the ech gene cluster was identified to be responsible for the biosynthesis of echosides, which was further confirmed by gene disruption and HPLC analysis. Meanwhile, the biosynthetic pathway for echosides was proposed. Furthermore, the echA-gene, encoding a tri-domain nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS)-like enzyme, was identified as a polyporic acid synthetase and biochemically characterized in vitro. This is the first study to our knowledge on the biochemical characterization of an Actinobacteria quinone synthetase, which accepts phenylpyruvic acid as a native substrate. Therefore, our results may help investigate the function of other NRPS-like enzymes in Actinobacteria.	1
Title: Elucidation of the hrp clusters of Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzicola that control the hypersensitive response in nonhost tobacco and pathogenicity in susceptible host rice Abstract: Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzicola, the cause of bacterial leaf streak in rice, possesses clusters of hrp genes that determine its ability to elicit a hypersensitive response (HR) in nonhost tobacco and pathogenicity in host rice. A 27-kb region of the genome of X. oryzae pv. oryzicola (RS105) was identified and sequenced, revealing 10 hrp, 9 hrc (hrp conserved), and 8 hpa (hrp-associated) genes and 7 regulatory plant-inducible promoter boxes. While the region from hpa2 to hpaB and the hrpF operon resembled the corresponding genes of other xanthomonads, the hpaB-hrpF region incorporated an hrpE3 gene that was not present in X. oryzae pv. oryzae. We found that an hrpF mutant had lost the ability to elicit the HR in tobacco and pathogenicity in adult rice plants but still caused water-soaking symptoms in rice seedlings and that Hpa1 is an HR elicitor in nonhost tobacco whose expression is controlled by an hrp regulator, HrpX. Using an Hrp phenotype complementation test, we identified a small hrp cluster containing the hrpG and hrpX regulatory genes, which is separated from the core hrp cluster. In addition, we identified a gene, prhA (plant-regulated hrp), that played a key role in the Hrp phenotype of X. oryzae pv. oryzicola but was neither in the core hrp cluster nor in the hrp regulatory cluster. A prhA mutant failed to reduce the HR in tobacco and pathogenicity in rice but caused water-soaking symptoms in rice. This is the first report that X. oryzae pv. oryzicola possesses three separate DNA regions for HR induction in nonhost tobacco and pathogenicity in host rice, which will provide a fundamental base to understand pathogenicity determinants of X. oryzae pv. oryzicola compared with those of X. oryzae pv. oryzae.	0
Title: In vitro reconstitution of indolmycin biosynthesis reveals the molecular basis of oxazolinone assembly Abstract: The bacterial tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase inhibitor indolmycin features a unique oxazolinone heterocycle whose biogenetic origins have remained obscure for over 50 years. Here we identify and characterize the indolmycin biosynthetic pathway, using systematic in vivo gene inactivation, in vitro biochemical assays, and total enzymatic synthesis. Our work reveals that a phenylacetate-CoA ligase-like enzyme Ind3 catalyzes an unusual ATP-dependent condensation of indolmycenic acid and dehydroarginine, driving oxazolinone ring assembly. We find that Ind6, which also has chaperone-like properties, acts as a gatekeeper to direct the outcome of this reaction. With Ind6 present, the normal pathway ensues. Without Ind6, the pathway derails to an unusual shunt product. Our work reveals the complete pathway for indolmycin formation and sets the stage for using genetic and chemoenzymatic methods to generate indolmycin derivatives as potential therapeutic agents.	1
Title: polR, a pathway-specific transcriptional regulatory gene, positively controls polyoxin biosynthesis in Streptomyces cacaoi subsp. asoensis Abstract: The polyoxin (POL) biosynthetic gene cluster (pol) was recently cloned from Streptomyces cacaoi subsp. asoensis. A 3.3 kb DNA fragment carrying an obvious open reading frame (polR), whose deduced product shows sequence similarity to SanG of Streptomyces ansochromogenes and PimR of Streptomyces natalensis, was revealed within the pol gene cluster. Disruption of polR abolished POL production, which could be complemented by the integration of a single copy of polR into the chromosome of the non-producing mutant. The introduction of an extra copy of polR in the wild-type strain resulted in increased production of POLs. The transcription start point (tsp) of polR was determined by S1 mapping. Reverse transcriptase PCR experiments showed that PolR is required for the transcription of 18 structural genes in the pol gene cluster. Furthermore, we showed that polC and polB, the respective first genes of two putative operons (polC-polQ2 and polA-polB) consisting of 16 and 2 of these 18 genes, have similar promoter structures. Gel retardation assays indicated that PolR has specific DNA-binding activity for the promoter regions of polC and polB. Our data suggest that PolR acts in a positive manner to regulate POL production by activating the transcription of at least two putative operons in the pol gene cluster.	1
Title: Rapid screening for freshwater bacterial groups by using reverse line blot hybridization Abstract: The identification of phylogenetic clusters of bacteria that are common in freshwater has provided a basis for probe design to target important freshwater groups. We present a set of 16S ribosomal RNA gene-based oligonucleotide probes specific for 15 of these freshwater clusters. The probes were applied in reverse line blot hybridization, a simple method that enables the rapid screening of PCR products from many samples against an array of probes. The optimized assay was made stringent to discriminate at approximately the single-mismatch level. This made 10 of the probes highly specific, with at least two mismatches to the closest noncluster member in the global database. Screening of PCR products from bacterioplankton of 81 diverse lakes from Belgium, The Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden, and Norway showed that the respective probes were reactive against 5 to 100% of the lake samples. Positive reactivity of six highly specific probes showed that bacteria from actinobacterial clusters ACK-M1 and Sta2-30 and from verrucomicrobial cluster CLO-14 occurred in at least 90% of the investigated lakes. Furthermore, bacteria from alpha-proteobacterial cluster LD12 (closely related to the marine SAR11 cluster), beta-proteobacterial cluster LD28 and cyanobacterial cluster Synechococcus 6b occurred in more than 70% of the lakes. Reverse line blot hybridization is a new tool in microbial ecology that will facilitate research on distribution and habitat specificity of target species at relatively low costs.	0
Title: Effects of prophylactic administration of bacteriophages to immunosuppressed mice infected with Staphylococcus aureus Abstract: Background:                       Bacteriophages can be successfully applied to treat infections caused by antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Until now no attempts have been undertaken to treat infections in immunosuppressed patients with phages. In this work we investigated the prophylactic efficacy of specific bacteriophages in CBA mice treated with cyclophosphamide (CP) and infected with Staphylococcus aureus.                  Results:                       High numbers of bacterial colony-forming units in the organs as well as elevated tumor necrosis factor and interleukin-6 serum concentrations in CP-treated and S. aureus-infected mice were significantly lowered upon application of phages. The phages markedly increased the percentage of circulating neutrophils and immature cells from the myelocytic and lymphocytic lineages in CP-treated, S. aureus-infected mice as well as of myelocytes and immature neutrophils in the bone marrow. In addition, phages stimulated in such mice generation of specific agglutinins against S. aureus.                  Conclusion:                       Application of specific phages to immunosuppressed mice prior to infection with S. aureus proved very effective, suggesting a potential benefit of phage therapy in immunocompromised patients experiencing bacterial infections.	0
Title: Parvifoline AA Promotes Susceptibility of Hepatocarcinoma to Natural Killer Cell-Mediated Cytolysis by Targeting Peroxiredoxin Abstract: Natural killer (NK) cells play a crucial role in the surveillance of malignant cells. The engagement of NK group 2 member D (NKG2D) receptor with its ligands on target cells represents a promising therapeutic strategy against cancers. Here, we report that parvifoline AA (PAA), a natural ent-kaurane diterpenoid, markedly stimulates the expression of NKG2D ligands on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells, considerably enhancing their recognition and lysis by NK cells. We determined that PAA covalently binds to the conserved cysteine site of peroxiredoxins I/II (Prxs-I/II) and inhibits their catalytic activity, subsequently activating the ROS/ERK axis and the immunogenicity of HCC toward NK cells. Robust tumor growth inhibition by PAA dependent on NK cell activation was detected in vivo. Our data suggest Prxs-I/II as a promising cancer immune therapeutic target and provide a compelling rationale for further development of the inhibitor PAA as a sensitizer agent for NK cell-mediated HCC immunotherapy.	0
Title: A Unique Tryptophan C-Prenyltransferase from the Kawaguchipeptin Biosynthetic Pathway Abstract: Cyanobactins are a rapidly growing family of linear and cyclic peptides produced by cyanobacteria. Kawaguchipeptins A and B, two macrocyclic undecapeptides reported earlier from Microcystis aeruginosa NIES-88, are shown to be products of the cyanobactin biosynthetic pathway. The 9 kb kawaguchipeptin (kgp) gene cluster was identified in a 5.26 Mb draft genome of Microcystis aeruginosa NIES-88. We verified that this gene cluster is responsible for the production of the kawaguchipeptins through heterologous expression of the kgp gene cluster in Escherichia coli. The KgpF prenyltransferase was overexpressed and was shown to prenylate C-3 of Trp residues in both linear and cyclic peptides in vitro. Our findings serve to further enhance the structural diversity of cyanobactins to include tryptophan-prenylated cyclic peptides.	1
Title: Activities of ten essential oils towards Propionibacterium acnes and PC-3, A-549 and MCF-7 cancer cells Abstract: Ten essential oils, namely, mint (Mentha spicata L., Lamiaceae), ginger (Zingiber officinale Rosc., Zingiberaceae), lemon (Citrus limon Burm.f., Rutaceae), grapefruit (Citrus paradisi Macf., Rutaceae), jasmine (Jasminum grandiflora L., Oleaceae), lavender (Mill., Lamiaceae), chamomile (Matricaria chamomilla L., Compositae), thyme (Thymus vulgaris L., Lamiaceae), rose (Rosa damascena Mill., Rosaceae) and cinnamon (Cinnamomum zeylanicum N. Lauraceae) were tested for their antibacterial activities towards Propionibacterium acnes and in vitro toxicology against three human cancer cell lines. Thyme, cinnamon and rose essential oils exhibited the best antibacterial activities towards P. acnes, with inhibition diameters of 40 +/- 1.2 mm, 33.5 +/- 1.5 mm and 16.5 +/- 0.7 mm, and minimal inhibitory concentrations of 0.016% (v/v), 0.016% (v/v) and 0.031% (v/v), respectively. Time-kill dynamic procedures showed that thyme, cinnamon, rose, and lavender essential oils exhibited the strongest bactericidal activities at a concentration of 0.25% (v/v), and P. acnes was completely killed after 5 min. The thyme essential oil exhibited the strongest cytotoxicity towards three human cancer cells. Its inhibition concentration 50% (IC(50)) values on PC-3, A549 and MCF-7 tumor cell lines were 0.010% (v/v), 0.011% (v/v) and 0.030% (v/v), respectively. The cytotoxicity of 10 essential oils on human prostate carcinoma cell (PC-3) was significantly stronger than on human lung carcinoma (A549) and human breast cancer (MCF-7) cell lines.	0
Title: Cloning and characterization of the biosynthetic gene cluster for tomaymycin, an SJG-136 monomeric analog Abstract: Tomaymycin produced by Streptomyces achromogenes is a naturally produced pyrrolobenzodiazepine (PBD). The biosynthetic gene cluster for tomaymycin was identified and sequenced. The gene cluster analysis reveals a novel biosynthetic pathway for the anthranilate moiety of PBDs. Gene replacement and chemical complementation studies were used to confirm the proposed biosynthetic pathway.	1
Title: Analysis of the carbapenem gene cluster of Erwinia carotovora: definition of the antibiotic biosynthetic genes and evidence for a novel beta-lactam resistance mechanism Abstract: Members of two genera of Gram-negative bacteria, Serratia and Erwinia, produce a beta-lactam antibiotic, 1-carbapen-2-em-3-carboxylic acid. We have reported previously the cloning and sequencing of the genes responsible for production of this carbapenem in Erwinia carotovora. These genes are organized as an operon, carA--H, and are controlled by a LuxR-type transcriptional activator, encoded by the linked carR gene. We report in this paper the genetic dissection of this putative operon to determine the function of each of the genes. We demonstrate by mutational analysis that the products of the first five genes of the operon are involved in the synthesis of the carbapenem molecule. Three of these, carABC, are absolutely required. In addition, we provide evidence for the existence of a novel carbapenem resistance mechanism, encoded by the CarF and carG genes. Both products of these overlapping and potentially translationally coupled genes have functional, N-terminal signal peptides. Removal of these genes from the Erwinia chromosome results in a carbapenem-sensitive phenotype. We assume that these novel beta-lactam resistance genes have evolved in concert with the biosynthetic genes to ensure 'self-resistance' in the Erwinia carbapenem producer.	1
Title: Ligand-controlled asymmetric arylation of aliphatic α-amino anion equivalents Abstract: A palladium-catalyzed asymmetric arylation of 9-aminofluorene-derived imines using a chiral dialkylbiaryl phosphine as the supporting ligand has been developed. This transformation allows for enantioselective access to a diverse range of α-branched benzylamines.	0
Title: A combined experimental and theoretical study of the thermal cycloaddition of aryl azides with activated alkenes Abstract: Reactions were performed from aryl azides on the one hand, and activated alkenes coming from β-dicarbonyl compounds or malonodinitrile on the other hand, either with recourse to conventional heating or to microwave activation, to afford 1-aryl-1H-1,2,3-triazoles. The mechanism and the regioselectivity of the reactions involving β-dicarbonyl compounds have been theoretically studied using DFT methods at the B3LYP/6-31G* level: they are domino processes comprising a tautomeric equilibrium of the β-dicarbonyl compounds with their enol forms, a 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition of the enol forms with the aryl azides (high activation energy), and a dehydration process (lower activation energy). The effect of non-conventional activation methods on the degradation of 1,2,3-triazolines was next studied experimentally. Finally, some of the 1,2,3-triazoles such synthesized were evaluated for their bactericidal and cytotoxic activities.	0
Title: CmlI is an N-oxygenase in the biosynthesis of chloramphenicol Abstract: The N-oxygenation of an amine group is one of the steps in the biosynthesis of the antibiotic chloramphenicol. The non-heme di-iron enzyme CmlI was identified as the enzyme catalyzing this reaction through bioinformatics studies and reconstitution of enzymatic activity. In vitro reconstitution was achieved using phenazine methosulfate and NADH as electron mediators, while in vivo activity was demonstrated in Escherichia coli using two substrates. Kinetic analysis showed a biphasic behavior of the enzyme. Oxidized hydroxylamine and nitroso compounds in the reaction were detected both in vitro and in vivo based on LC-MS. The active site metal was confirmed to be iron based on a ferrozine assay. These findings provide new insights into the biosynthesis of chloramphenicol and could lead to further development of CmlI as a useful biocatalyst.	1
Title: Noninvasive photoacoustic microscopy of living cells in two and three dimensions through enhancement by a metabolite dye Abstract: Photoacoustic microscopy (PAM) is a powerful imaging modality that can generate high-resolution, three-dimensional (3D) images non-invasively. However, most types of cells cannot be imaged and quantified by PAM due to the lack of an absorption-based contrast mechanism. Here we demonstrate that this problem could be solved by employing 1-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-3,5-diphenylformazan (MTT formazan), a cellular metabolite of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT), as the contrast agent. The as-formed MTT formazan crystals inside the cells have a strong absorption in the spectral region of 500-700 nm, and are generally nontoxic. It could serve as a superb contrast agent for PAM in imaging various types of cells cultured on two-dimensional (2D) substrates and in 3D porous scaffolds. This contrast mechanism is general, and can be applied to essentially all types of metabolically active cells including stem cells and tumor cells, which would be very useful for a number of biological and biomedical applications.	0
Title: Hapalindole/Ambiguine Biogenesis Is Mediated by a Cope Rearrangement, C-C Bond-Forming Cascade Abstract: Hapalindoles are bioactive indole alkaloids with fascinating polycyclic ring systems whose biosynthetic assembly mechanism has remained unknown since their initial discovery in the 1980s. In this study, we describe the fam gene cluster from the cyanobacterium Fischerella ambigua UTEX 1903 encoding hapalindole and ambiguine biosynthesis along with the characterization of two aromatic prenyltransferases, FamD1 and FamD2, and a previously undescribed cyclase, FamC1. These studies demonstrate that FamD2 and FamC1 act in concert to form the tetracyclic core ring system of the hapalindoles from cis-indole isonitrile and geranyl pyrophosphate through a presumed biosynthetic Cope rearrangement and subsequent 6-exo-trig cyclization/electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction.	1
Title: Prevention of peroxidative stress in rats fed on a low vitamin E-containing diet by supplementing with a fermented bovine milk whey preparation: effect of lactic acid and beta-lactoglobulin on the antiperoxidative action Abstract: We examined the antiperoxidative properties of a fermented bovine milk whey preparation in rats fed on a low vitamin E-containing diet and identified the active principle in the preparation. An exogenous supply of either lactic acid or an amino acid mixture simulated the unfermented whey proteins to prevent red blood cell (RBC) hemolysis and to lower liver thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS). The supply of either whey proteins or beta-lactoglobulin resulted in an increase in liver GSH and prevented iron-mediated lipoprotein peroxidation. These protein effects were reproduced in rats orally administered with either GSH or its precursor, gamma-glutamylcysteine. The amount of TBARS formed during in vitro lipoprotein peroxidation were positively correlated with liver TBARS. These results suggest that fermented milk products containing lactic acid and bovine milk whey proteins can ameliorate peroxidative stress in tissues subjected to vitamin E deficiency.	0
Title: Biosynthesis of fluopsin C, a copper-containing antibiotic from Pseudomonas aeruginosa Abstract: Metal-binding natural products contribute to metal acquisition and bacterial virulence, but their roles in metal stress response are underexplored. We show that a five-enzyme pathway in Pseudomonas aeruginosa synthesizes a small-molecule copper complex, fluopsin C, in response to elevated copper concentrations. Fluopsin C is a broad-spectrum antibiotic that contains a copper ion chelated by two minimal thiohydroxamates. Biosynthesis of the thiohydroxamate begins with cysteine and requires two lyases, two iron-dependent enzymes, and a methyltransferase. The iron-dependent enzymes remove the carboxyl group and the α carbon from cysteine through decarboxylation, N-hydroxylation, and methylene excision. Conservation of the pathway in P. aeruginosa and other bacteria suggests a common role for fluopsin C in the copper stress response, which involves fusing copper into an antibiotic against other microbes.	1
Title: New technology and resources for cryptococcal research Abstract: Rapid advances in molecular biology and genome sequencing have enabled the generation of new technology and resources for cryptococcal research. RNAi-mediated specific gene knock down has become routine and more efficient by utilizing modified shRNA plasmids and convergent promoter RNAi constructs. This system was recently applied in a high-throughput screen to identify genes involved in host-pathogen interactions. Gene deletion efficiencies have also been improved by increasing rates of homologous recombination through a number of approaches, including a combination of double-joint PCR with split-marker transformation, the use of dominant selectable markers and the introduction of Cre-Loxp systems into Cryptococcus. Moreover, visualization of cryptococcal proteins has become more facile using fusions with codon-optimized fluorescent tags, such as green or red fluorescent proteins or, mCherry. Using recent genome-wide analytical tools, new transcriptional factors and regulatory proteins have been identified in novel virulence-related signaling pathways by employing microarray analysis, RNA-sequencing and proteomic analysis.	0
Title: Ecology of Thioploca spp.: nitrate and sulfur storage in relation to chemical microgradients and influence of Thioploca spp. on the sedimentary nitrogen cycle Abstract: Microsensors, including a recently developed NO3(-) biosensor, were applied to measure O(2) and NO3(-) profiles in marine sediments from the upwelling area off central Chile and to investigate the influence of Thioploca spp. on the sedimentary nitrogen metabolism. The studies were performed in undisturbed sediment cores incubated in a small laboratory flume to simulate the environmental conditions of low O(2), high NO3(-), and bottom water current. On addition of NO3(-) and NO2(-), Thioploca spp. exhibited positive chemotaxis and stretched out of the sediment into the flume water. In a core densely populated with Thioploca, the penetration depth of NO3(-) was only 0.5 mm and a sharp maximum of NO3(-) uptake was observed 0.5 mm above the sediment surface. In sediments with only few Thioploca spp., NO3(-) was detectable down to a depth of 2 mm and the maximum consumption rates were observed within the sediment. No chemotaxis toward nitrous oxide (N2O) was observed, which is consistent with the observation that Thioploca does not denitrify but reduces intracellular NO3(-) to NH(4)(+). Measurements of the intracellular NO3(-) and S(0) pools in Thioploca filaments from various depths in the sediment gave insights into possible differences in the migration behavior between the different species. Living filaments containing significant amounts of intracellular NO3(-) were found to a depth of at least 13 cm, providing final proof for the vertical shuttling of Thioploca spp. and nitrate transport into the sediment.	0
Title: Actinopolysporins A-C and tubercidin as a Pdcd4 stabilizer from the halophilic actinomycete Actinopolyspora erythraea YIM 90600 Abstract: Our current natural product program utilizes new actinomycetes originating from unexplored and underexplored ecological niches, employing cytotoxicity against a selected panel of cancer cell lines as the preliminary screen to identify hit strains for natural product dereplication, followed by mechanism-based assays of the purified natural products to discover potential anticancer drug leads. Three new linear polyketides, actinopolysporins A (1), B (2), and C (3), along with the known antineoplastic antibiotic tubercidin (4), were isolated from the halophilic actinomycete Actinopolyspora erythraea YIM 90600, and the structures of the new compounds were elucidated on the basis of spectroscopic data interpretation. All four compounds were assayed for their ability to stabilize the tumor suppressor programmed cell death protein 4 (Pdcd4), which is known to antagonize critical events in oncogenic pathways. Only 4 significantly inhibited proteasomal degradation of a model Pdcd4-luciferase fusion protein, with an IC50 of 0.88±0.09 μM, unveiling a novel biological activity for this well-studied natural product.	0
Title: Lrp binds to two regions in the dadAX promoter region of Escherichia coli to repress and activate transcription directly Abstract: The dadAX operon is expressed by multiple promoters that are repressed by leucine-responsive regulatory protein (Lrp) and activated by cyclic AMP-CRP. In previous work, we found that alanine or leucine acted as inducers to antagonize Lrp repression of the three major promoters directly. Here, we identify 11 Lrp binding sites located within 350 bp of dad DNA. A mutational analysis, coupled with in vivo and in vitro transcription experiments, indicated that Lrp sites that overlap the dad promoters were involved in repression. In contrast, sites upstream of the promoters did not appear to be necessary for repression, but were required for activation by Lrp plus alanine or leucine of one of the major dad promoters, P2. This activation by alanine or leucine was not simply relief of repression, as P2 transcription from a constitutive template was increased fivefold compared with the basal level of transcription found in the absence of Lrp and the co-activator cyclic AMP-CRP. Alanine or leucine decreased the affinity of Lrp to repressor sites, while having little or no effect on the binding of Lrp to activator sites. This differential effect of alanine and leucine on Lrp binding helps to explain how these modifiers influence both repression and activation of the dad operon.	0
Title: A gene located downstream of the clavulanic acid gene cluster in Streptomyces clavuligerus ATCC 27064 encodes a putative response regulator that affects clavulanic acid production Abstract: Three open reading frames denoted as orf21, orf22, and orf23 were identified from downstream of the currently recognized gene cluster for clavulanic acid biosynthesis in Streptomyces clavuligerus ATCC 27064. The new orfs were annotated after in silico analysis as genes encoding a putative sigma factor, a sensor kinase, and a response regulator. The roles of the individual genes were explored by disruption of the corresponding orfs, and the morphological and antibiotic production phenotypes of the resulting mutants were compared. In orf21 and orf22 mutants, no growth or morphological differences were noted, but modest reduction of cephamycin C (orf21), or both cephamycin C and clavulanic acid production (orf22) compared with wild-type, were observed. In orf23 mutant, cell growth and sporulation was retarded, and clavulanic acid and cephamycin C production were reduced to 40 and 47% of wild-type levels, respectively. Conversely, overexpression of orf23 caused precocious hyperproduction of spores on solid medium, and antibiotic production was increased above the levels seen in plasmid control cultures. Transcriptional analyses were also carried out on orf23 and showed that mutation had little effect on transcription of genes associated with the early stages of cephamycin C or clavulanic acid production but transcription of claR, which regulates the late stages of clavulanic acid production, was reduced in orf23 mutants. These observations suggest that the orf23 product may enable S. clavuligerus to respond to environmental changes by altering cell growth and differentiation. In addition, the effects of ORF23 on growth might indirectly regulate the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites such as clavulanic acid and cephamycin C.	1
Title: RP-1776, a novel cyclic peptide produced by Streptomyces sp., inhibits the binding of PDGF to the extracellular domain of its receptor Abstract: RP-1776, a novel cyclic peptide, was isolated from the culture broth of Streptomyces sp. KY11784. RP-1776 selectively inhibited the binding of PDGF BB to the extracellular domain of the PDGF beta-receptor with an IC50 value of 11 +/- 6 microM. Detailed binding experiments suggested that RP-1776 directly interacts with PDGF BB. RP-1776 inhibited the phosphorylation of the PDGF beta-receptor induced by PDGF BB. These results suggested that RP-1776 antagonizes the signaling of PDGF BB probably through the inhibition of PDGF BB binding to the PDGF beta-receptor.	1
Title: A seventeen kilodaltons peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase of the cyclosporin-producer Tolypocladium inflatum is sensitive to cyclosporin A Abstract: A peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase (PPIase) was purified to homogeneity about 24-fold from the cyclosporin-producing fungus Tolypocladium inflatum. The molecular mass of the enzyme was in the range of 17 kdaltons. Remarkably, the enzyme could be inhibited by cyclosporin A in the nanomolar range as has been shown for numerous other cyclophilins from eukaryotic organisms. This indicates, that Tolypocladium inflatum must possess a self protection system in order to survive in the presence of cyclosporin.	0
Title: Genome sequences of four divergent multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii strains isolated from patients with sepsis or osteomyelitis Abstract: Acinetobacter baumannii is a Gram-negative bacterium that causes nosocomial infections worldwide, with recent prevalence and higher frequency in wounded military personnel. Four A. baumannii strains from the Walter Reed Army Medical Center (WRAMC) isolated between 2008 and 2009 were sequenced, representing diverse, multidrug-resistant isolates from osteomyelitis or septic patients.	0
Title: A Genomic View of Lactobacilli and Pediococci Demonstrates that Phylogeny Matches Ecology and Physiology Abstract: Lactobacilli are used widely in food, feed, and health applications. The taxonomy of the genus Lactobacillus, however, is confounded by the apparent lack of physiological markers for phylogenetic groups of lactobacilli and the unclear relationships between the diverse phylogenetic groups. This study used the core and pan-genomes of 174 type strains of Lactobacillus and Pediococcus to establish phylogenetic relationships and to identify metabolic properties differentiating phylogenetic groups. The core genome phylogenetic tree separated homofermentative lactobacilli and pediococci from heterofermentative lactobacilli. Aldolase and phosphofructokinase were generally present in homofermentative but not in heterofermentative lactobacilli; a two-domain alcohol dehydrogenase and mannitol dehydrogenase were present in most heterofermentative lactobacilli but absent in most homofermentative organisms. Other genes were predominantly present in homofermentative lactobacilli (pyruvate formate lyase) or heterofermentative lactobacilli (lactaldehyde dehydrogenase and glycerol dehydratase). Cluster analysis of the phylogenomic tree and the average nucleotide identity grouped the genus Lactobacillus sensu lato into 24 phylogenetic groups, including pediococci, with stable intra- and intergroup relationships. Individual groups may be differentiated by characteristic metabolic properties. The link between phylogeny and physiology that is proposed in this study facilitates future studies on the ecology, physiology, and industrial applications of lactobacilli.	0
Title: Studies on cephalosporin antibiotics. IV. Synthesis, antibacterial activity and oral absorption of new 3-(2-substituted-vinylthio)-7 beta-[(Z)-2-(2-aminothiazol-4-yl)-2- (carboxymethoxyimino)acetamido]cephalosporins Abstract: A series of new 7 beta-[(Z)-2-(2-aminothiazol-4-yl)-2-(carboxymethoxyimino)ace tamido] cephalosporins (1) having various substituted-vinylthio groups at the C-3 position of the cephen nucleus was synthesized and evaluated for antibacterial activity and oral absorption in rats in comparison with cefixime. Of these, the cephalosporins (1a and 1c) with a lower alkoxycarbonylvinylthio group (Z-form) at the C-3 position showed a potent antibacterial activity against Gram-negative bacteria, improved activity against Staphylococcus aureus as well as good oral absorption in rats. The structure-activity relationships of 1 are also presented.	0
Title: A new family of ATP-dependent oligomerization-macrocyclization biocatalysts Abstract: Oligomerization and macrocyclization reactions are key steps in the biosynthesis of many bioactive natural products. Important macrocycles include the antibiotic daptomycin (1; ref. 1), the immunosuppressant FK-506 (2; ref. 2), the anthelmintic avermectin B1a (3; ref. 3) and the insecticide spinosyn A (4; ref. 4); important oligomeric macrocycles include the siderophores enterobactin (5; ref. 5) and desferrioxamine E (6; ref. 6). Biosynthetic oligomerization and macrocyclization reactions typically involve covalently tethered intermediates and are catalyzed by thioesterase domains of polyketide synthase and nonribosomal peptide synthetase multienzymes. Here we report that the purified recombinant desferrioxamine siderophore synthetase DesD from Streptomyces coelicolor M145 catalyzes ATP-dependent trimerization-macrocyclization of a chemically synthesized 10-aminocarboxylic acid substrate via noncovalently bound intermediates. DesD is dissimilar to other known synthetase families but is similar to other enzymes known or proposed to be required for the biosynthesis of omega-aminocarboxylic acid-derived cyclodimeric siderophores. This suggests that DesD is the first biochemically characterized member of a new family of oligomerizing and macrocyclizing synthetases.	1
Title: Evolution of the terminal regions of the Streptomyces linear chromosome Abstract: Comparative analysis of the Streptomyces chromosome sequences, between Streptomyces coelicolor, Streptomyces avermitilis, and Streptomyces ambofaciens ATCC23877 (whose partial sequence is released in this study), revealed a highly compartmentalized genetic organization of their genome. Indeed, despite the presence of specific genomic islands, the central part of the chromosome appears highly syntenic. In contrast, the chromosome of each species exhibits large species-specific terminal regions (from 753 to 1,393 kb), even when considering closely related species (S. ambofaciens and S. coelicolor). Interestingly, the size of the central conserved region between species decreases as the phylogenetic distance between them increases, whereas the specific terminal fraction reciprocally increases in size. Between highly syntenic central regions and species-specific chromosomal parts, there is a notable degeneration of synteny due to frequent insertions/deletions. This reveals a massive and constant genomic flux (from lateral gene transfer and DNA rearrangements) affecting the terminal contingency regions. We speculate that a gradient of recombination rate (i.e., insertion/deletion events) toward the extremities is the force driving the exclusion of essential genes from the terminal regions (i.e., chromosome compartmentalization) and generating a fast gene turnover for strong adaptation capabilities.	1
Title: Preferential selection of deletion mutations of the outer membrane lipoprotein gene of Escherichia coli by globomycin Abstract: Globomycin is an antibiotic which inhibits the processing of the prolipoprotein. Eighty globomycin-resistant mutants were independently isolated from Escherichia coli K-12 which had a deletion mutation in chromosomal lipoprotein gene (lpp), but contained a plasmid carrying the wild-type lpp gene. Twenty-six of the mutants did not have the lipoprotein in the membrane fractions. From the analysis of the plasmids of these mutants, all of the lipoprotein-deficient mutations were found to be due to deletion mutations around the lpp gene.	0
Title: Bioactive Antimicrobial Peptides: A New Weapon to Counteract Zoonosis Abstract: Zoonoses have recently become the center of attention of the general population and scientific community. Notably, more than 30 new human pathogens have been identified in the last 30 years, 75% of which can be classified as zoonosis. The complete eradication of such types of infections is far out of reach, considering the limited understanding of animal determinants in zoonoses and their causes of emergence. Therefore, efforts must be doubled in examining the spread, persistence, and pathogenicity of zoonosis and studying possible clinical interventions and antimicrobial drug development. The search for antimicrobial bioactive compounds has assumed great emphasis, considering the emergence of multi-drug-resistant microorganisms. Among the biomolecules of emerging scientific interest are antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), potent biomolecules that can potentially act as important weapons against infectious diseases. Moreover, synthetic AMPs are easily tailored (bioinformatically) to target specific features of the pathogens to hijack, inducing no or very low resistance. Although very promising, previous studies on SAMPs' efficacy are still at their early stages. Indeed, further studies and better characterization on their mechanism of action with in vitro and in vivo assays are needed so as to proceed to their clinical application on human beings.	0
Title: Sequence analysis and functional characterization of the violacein biosynthetic pathway from Chromobacterium violaceum Abstract: Violacein is a purple-colored, broad-spectrum antibacterial pigment that has a dimeric structure composed of 5-hydroxyindole, oxindole and 2-pyyrolidone subunits formed by the condensation of two modified tryptophan molecules. The violacein biosynthetic gene cluster from Chromobacterium violaceum was characterized by DNA sequencing, transposon mutagenesis, and chemical analysis of the pathway intermediates produced heterologously in Escherichia. coli. The violacein biosynthetic gene cluster spans eight kilobases and is comprised of the four genes, vioABCD, that are necessary for violacein production. Sequence analysis suggests that the products of vioA, vioC and vioD are nucleotide-dependent monooxygenases. Disruption of vioA or vioB completely abrogates the biosynthesis of violacein intermediates, while disruption of the vioC or vioD genes results in the production of violacein precursors.	1
Title: Identification of a biosynthetic gene cluster for the polyene macrolactam sceliphrolactam in a Streptomyces strain isolated from mangrove sediment Abstract: Streptomyces are a genus of Actinobacteria capable of producing structurally diverse natural products. Here we report the isolation and characterization of a biosynthetically talented Streptomyces (Streptomyces sp. SD85) from tropical mangrove sediments. Whole-genome sequencing revealed that Streptomyces sp. SD85 harbors at least 52 biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs), which constitute 21.2% of the 8.6-Mb genome. When cultivated under lab conditions, Streptomyces sp. SD85 produces sceliphrolactam, a 26-membered polyene macrolactam with unknown biosynthetic origin. Genome mining yielded a putative sceliphrolactam BGC (sce) that encodes a type I modular polyketide synthase (PKS) system, several β-amino acid starter biosynthetic enzymes, transporters, and transcriptional regulators. Using the CRISPR/Cas9-based gene knockout method, we demonstrated that the sce BGC is essential for sceliphrolactam biosynthesis. Unexpectedly, the PKS system encoded by sce is short of one module required for assembling the 26-membered macrolactam skeleton according to the collinearity rule. With experimental data disfavoring the involvement of a trans-PKS module, the biosynthesis of sceliphrolactam seems to be best rationalized by invoking a mechanism whereby the PKS system employs an iterative module to catalyze two successive chain extensions with different outcomes. The potential violation of the collinearity rule makes the mechanism distinct from those of other polyene macrolactams.	1
Title: Pathway for the Biosynthesis of the Pigment Chrysogine by Penicillium chrysogenum Abstract: Chrysogine is a yellow pigment produced by Penicillium chrysogenum and other filamentous fungi. Although the pigment was first isolated in 1973, its biosynthetic pathway has so far not been resolved. Here, we show that deletion of the highly expressed nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) gene Pc21g12630 (chyA) resulted in a decrease in the production of chrysogine and 13 related compounds in the culture broth of P. chrysogenum Each of the genes of the chyA-containing gene cluster was individually deleted, and corresponding mutants were examined by metabolic profiling in order to elucidate their function. The data suggest that the NRPS ChyA mediates the condensation of anthranilic acid and alanine into the intermediate 2-(2-aminopropanamido)benzoic acid, which was verified by feeding experiments of a ΔchyA strain with the chemically synthesized product. The remainder of the pathway is highly branched, yielding at least 13 chrysogine-related compounds.IMPORTANCEPenicillium chrysogenum is used in industry for the production of β-lactams, but also produces several other secondary metabolites. The yellow pigment chrysogine is one of the most abundant metabolites in the culture broth, next to β-lactams. Here, we have characterized the biosynthetic gene cluster involved in chrysogine production and elucidated a complex and highly branched biosynthetic pathway, assigning each of the chrysogine cluster genes to biosynthetic steps and metabolic intermediates. The work further unlocks the metabolic potential of filamentous fungi and the complexity of secondary metabolite pathways.	1
Title: Cloning, overexpression, and purification of novobiocic acid synthetase from Streptomyces spheroides NCIMB 11891 Abstract: Novobiocic acid synthetase, a key enzyme in the biosynthesis of the antibiotic novobiocin, was cloned from the novobiocin producer Streptomyces spheroides NCIMB 11891. The enzyme is encoded by the gene novL, which codes for a protein of 527 amino acids with a calculated mass of 56,885 Da. The protein was overexpressed as a His(6) fusion protein in Escherichia coli and purified to apparent homogeneity by affinity chromatography and gel chromatography. The purified enzyme catalyzed the formation of an amide bond between 3-dimethylallyl-4-hydroxybenzoic acid (ring A of novobiocin) and 3-amino-4,7-dihydroxy-8-methyl coumarin (ring B of novobiocin) in an ATP-dependent reaction. NovL shows homology to the superfamily of adenylate-forming enzymes, and indeed the formation of an acyl adenylate from ring A and ATP was demonstrated by an ATP-PP(i) exchange assay. The purified enzyme exhibited both activation and transferase activity, i.e. it catalyzed both the activation of ring A as acyl adenylate and the subsequent transfer of the acyl group to the amino group of ring B. It is active as a monomer as determined by gel filtration chromatography. The reaction was specific for ATP as nucleotide triphosphate and dependent on the presence of Mg(2+) or Mn(2+). Apparent K(m) values for ring A and ring B were determined as 19 and 131 micrometer respectively. Of several analogues of ring A, only 3-geranyl-4-hydroxybenzoate and to a lesser extent 3-methyl-4-aminobenzoate were accepted as substrates.	1
Title: Deletion and gene expression analyses define the paxilline biosynthetic gene cluster in Penicillium paxilli Abstract: The indole-diterpene paxilline is an abundant secondary metabolite synthesized by Penicillium paxilli. In total, 21 genes have been identified at the PAX locus of which six have been previously confirmed to have a functional role in paxilline biosynthesis. A combination of bioinformatics, gene expression and targeted gene replacement analyses were used to define the boundaries of the PAX gene cluster. Targeted gene replacement identified seven genes, paxG, paxA, paxM, paxB, paxC, paxP and paxQ that were all required for paxilline production, with one additional gene, paxD, required for regular prenylation of the indole ring post paxilline synthesis. The two putative transcription factors, PP104 and PP105, were not co-regulated with the pax genes and based on targeted gene replacement, including the double knockout, did not have a role in paxilline production. The relationship of indole dimethylallyl transferases involved in prenylation of indole-diterpenes such as paxilline or lolitrem B, can be found as two disparate clades, not supported by prenylation type (e.g., regular or reverse). This paper provides insight into the P. paxilli indole-diterpene locus and reviews the recent advances identified in paxilline biosynthesis.	1
Title: Albicidin pathotoxin produced by Xanthomonas albilineans is encoded by three large PKS and NRPS genes present in a gene cluster also containing several putative modifying, regulatory, and resistance genes Abstract: Xanthomonas albilineans, which causes leaf scald disease of sugarcane, produces a highly potent pathotoxin called albicidin. We report here sequencing and homology analysis of the major gene cluster, XALB1 (55,839 bp), and a second, smaller region, XALB2 (2,986 bp), involved in albicidin biosynthesis. XALB1 contains 20 open reading frames, including i) three large genes with a modular architecture characteristic of polyketide synthases (PKSs) and nonribosomal peptide synthases (NRPSs) and ii) several putative modifying, regulatory, and resistance genes. Sequencing and complementation studies of six albicidin-defective mutants enabled us to confirm the involvement of the three PKS and NRPS genes encoded by XALB1 in albicidin production. XALB2 contains only one gene that is required for post-translational activation of PKS and NRPS enzymes, confirming the involvement of these enzymes in albicidin biosynthesis. In silico analysis of these three PKS or NRPS enzymes allowed us to propose a model for the albicidin backbone assembly and to gain insight into the structural features of this pathotoxin. This is the first description of a complete mixed PKS-NRPS gene cluster for toxin production in the genus Xanthomonas.	1
Title: In vivo manipulation of the bleomycin biosynthetic gene cluster in Streptomyces verticillus ATCC15003 revealing new insights into its biosynthetic pathway Abstract: Bleomycin (BLM), an important clinically used antitumor compound, and its analogs are challenging to prepare by chemical synthesis. Genetic engineering of the biosynthetic pathway in the producer strain would provide an efficient and convenient method of generating new derivatives of this complex molecule in vivo. However, the BLM producing Streptomyces verticillus ATCC15003 has been refractory to all means of introducing plasmid DNA into its cells for nearly two decades. Several years after cloning and identification of the bleomycin biosynthetic gene cluster, this study demonstrates, for the first time, genetic accessibility of this pharmaceutically relevant producer strain by intergeneric Escherichia coli-Streptomyces conjugation. Gene replacement and in-frame deletion mutants were created by lambdaRED-mediated PCR targeting mutagenesis, and the secondary metabolite profile of the resultant mutants confirmed the identity of the BLM biosynthetic gene cluster and established its boundaries. Ultimately, the in-frame blmD deletion mutant strain S. verticillus SB5 resulted in the production of a bleomycin intermediate. The structure of this compound, decarbamoyl-BLM, was elucidated, and its DNA cleavage activity was compared with the parent compounds.	1
Title: Elusive metal-free primary amination of arylboronic acids: synthetic studies and mechanism by density functional theory Abstract: Herein, we disclose the first metal-free synthesis of primary aromatic amines from arylboronic acids, a reaction that has eluded synthetic chemists for decades. This remarkable transformation affords structurally diverse primary arylamines in good chemical yields, including a variety of halogenated primary anilines that often cannot be prepared via transition-metal-catalyzed amination. The reaction is operationally simple, requires only a slight excess of aminating agent, proceeds under neutral or basic conditions, and, importantly, can be scaled up to provide multigram quantities of primary anilines. Density functional calculations reveal that the most likely mechanism involves a facile 1,2-aryl migration and that the presence of an ortho nitro group in the aminating agent plays a critical role in lowering the free energy barrier of the 1,2-aryl migration step.	0
Title: Use of PCR-targeted mutagenesis to disrupt production of fusaricidin-type antifungal antibiotics in Paenibacillus polymyxa Abstract: Paenibacillus polymyxa (formerly Bacillus polymyxa) PKB1 has been identified as a potential agent for biocontrol of blackleg disease of canola, caused by the pathogenic fungus Leptosphaeria maculans. The factors presumed to contribute to disease suppression by strain PKB1 include the production of fusaricidin-type antifungal metabolites that appear around the onset of bacterial sporulation. The fusaricidins are a family of lipopeptide antibiotics consisting of a beta-hydroxy fatty acid linked to a cyclic hexapeptide. Using a reverse genetic approach based on conserved motifs of nonribosomal peptide synthetases, a DNA fragment that appears to encode the first two modules of the putative fusaricidin synthetase (fusA) was isolated from PKB1. To confirm the involvement of fusA in production of fusaricidins, a modified PCR targeting mutagenesis protocol was developed to create a fusA mutation in PKB1. A DNA fragment internal to fusA was replaced by a gene disruption cassette containing two antibiotic resistance genes for independent selection of apramycin resistance in Escherichia coli and chloramphenicol resistance in P. polymyxa. Inclusion of an oriT site in the disruption cassette allowed efficient transfer of the inactivated fusA allele to P. polymyxa by intergeneric conjugation. Targeted disruption of fusA led to the complete loss of antifungal activity against L. maculans, suggesting that fusA plays an essential role in the nonribosomal synthesis of fusaricidins.	1
Title: Phosphorylation as a tool to modulate aggregation propensity and to predict fibril architecture Abstract: Despite the importance of post-translational modifications in controlling the solubility and conformational properties of proteins and peptides, precisely how the aggregation propensity of different peptide sequences is modulated by chemical modification remains unclear. Here we have investigated the effect of phosphorylation on the aggregation propensity of a 13-residue synthetic peptide incorporating one or more phosphate groups at seven different sites at various pH values. Fibril formation was shown to be inhibited when a single phosphate group was introduced at all seven locations in the peptide sequence at pH 7.5, when the phosphate group is fully charged. By contrast, when the same peptides were analysed at pH 1.1, when the phosphate is fully protonated, fibrils from all seven peptide sequences form rapidly. At intermediate pH values (pH 3.6) when the phosphate group is mono-anionic, the aggregation propensity of the peptides was found to be highly dependent on the position of the phosphate group in the peptide sequence. Using this information, combined with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the peptide sequence, we provide evidence consistent with the peptide forming amyloid fibrils with a class 7 architecture. The results highlight the potential utility of phosphorylation as a method of reversibly controlling the aggregation kinetics of peptide sequences both during and after synthesis. Moreover, by exploiting the ability of the phosphate group to adopt different charge states as a function of pH, and combining experimental insights with atomistic information calculated from MD simulations as pH is varied, we show how the resulting information can be used to predict fibril structures consistent with both datasets, and use these to rationalise their sensitivity of fibrillation kinetics both to the location of the phosphate group and its charge state.	0
Title: Deciphering the biosynthetic codes for the potent anti-SARS-CoV cyclodepsipeptide valinomycin in Streptomyces tsusimaensis ATCC 15141 Abstract: Valinomycin was recently reported to be the most potent agent against severe acute respiratory-syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in infected Vero E6 cells. Aimed at generating analogues by metabolic engineering, the valinomycin biosynthetic gene cluster has been cloned from Streptomyces tsusimaensis ATCC 15141. Targeted disruption of a nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) gene abolishes valinomycin production, which confirms its predicted nonribosomal-peptide origin. Sequence analysis of the NRPS system reveals four distinctive modules, two of which contain unusual domain organizations that are presumably involved in the generation of biosynthetic precursors D-alpha-hydroxyisovaleric acid and L-lactic acid. The respective adenylation domains in these two modules contain novel substrate-specificity-conferring codes that might specify for a class of hydroxyl acids for the biosynthesis of the depsipeptide natural products.	1
Title: Uncovering the unusual D-ring construction in terretonin biosynthesis by collaboration of a multifunctional cytochrome P450 and a unique isomerase Abstract: Terretonin (1) is a fungal meroterpenoid isolated from Aspergillus terreus, and possesses a highly oxygenated and unique tetracyclic structure. Although the biosynthetic gene cluster for 1 has been identified and the biosynthesis has recently been studied by heterologous reconstitution and targeted-gene deletion experiments, the last few steps of the terretonin pathway after terrenoid (6) have yet to be elucidated. Notably, the mechanism for the D-ring expansion to afford the terretonin scaffold has been a long-standing mystery to solve. Here we report the characterization of three enzymes that convert 6 into 1, as well as the complete biosynthetic pathway of 1. In the proposed terretonin pathway, the cytochrome P450 Trt6 catalyzes three successive oxidations to transform 6 into an unstable intermediate, which then undergoes the D-ring expansion and unusual rearrangement of the methoxy group to afford the core skeleton of 1. This unprecedented rearrangement is catalyzed by a novel isomerase Trt14. Finally, the nonheme iron-dependent dioxygenase Trt7 accomplishes the last two oxidation reactions steps to complete the biosynthesis.	1
Title: Studies on cephalosporin antibiotics. VI. Synthesis, antibacterial activity and oral efficacy in mice of new 7 beta-[(Z)-2-(2-aminothiazol-4-yl)-2-(hydroxyimino)-acetamido]-3- (substituted alkylthio)cephalosporins Abstract: A series of new 7 beta-[(Z)-2-(2-aminothiazol-4-yl)-2-(hydroxyimino)acetamido] cephalosporins (1) having various substituted alkylthio groups at the C-3 position of the cephem nucleus were prepared and evaluated for antibacterial activity and oral absorption in rats. Of these, the cephalosporin with a cyanomethylthio group (1a) showed the greatest activity against Staphylococcus aureus and Gram-negative bacteria. Its pivaloyloxymethyl ester (6a), a representative prodrug, exhibited good in vivo efficacy in mice by oral administration. The structure-activity relationships of 1 are also presented.	0
Title: Diffusion-controlled ligand binding to spheres partially covered by receptors: an effective medium treatment Abstract: An effective medium treatment is used to extend Berg and Purcell's theory of diffusion-controlled ligand binding to a sphere partially covered by receptors. This treatment takes into account more completely the effects of interference between receptors. The results are in excellent agreement with computer simulations by Northrup.	0
Title: Molecular characterization of the enniatin synthetase gene encoding a multifunctional enzyme catalysing N-methyldepsipeptide formation in Fusarium scirpi Abstract: The gene encoding the multifunctional enzyme enniatin synthetase from Fusarium scirpi (esyn1) was isolated and characterized by transcriptional mapping and expression studies in Escherichia coli. This is the first example of a gene encoding an N-methyl peptide synthetase. The nucleotide sequence revealed an open reading frame of 9393 bp encoding a protein of 3131 amino acids (M(r) 346,900). Two domains designated EA and EB within the protein were identified which share similarity to each other and to microbial peptide synthetase domains. In contrast to the N-terminal domain EA, the carboxyl terminal domain EB is interrupted by a 434-amino-acid portion which shows local similarity to a motif apparently conserved within adenine and cytosine RNA and DNA methyltransferases and therefore seems to harbour the N-methyl-transferase function of the multienzyme.	1
Title: tRNA overexpression rescues peripheral neuropathy caused by mutations in tRNA synthetase Abstract: Heterozygous mutations in six transfer RNA (tRNA) synthetase genes cause Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) peripheral neuropathy. CMT mutant tRNA synthetases inhibit protein synthesis by an unknown mechanism. We found that CMT mutant glycyl-tRNA synthetases bound tRNAGly but failed to release it, resulting in tRNAGly sequestration. This sequestration potentially depleted the cellular tRNAGly pool, leading to insufficient glycyl-tRNAGly supply to the ribosome. Accordingly, we found ribosome stalling at glycine codons and activation of the integrated stress response (ISR) in affected motor neurons. Moreover, transgenic overexpression of tRNAGly rescued protein synthesis, peripheral neuropathy, and ISR activation in Drosophila and mouse CMT disease type 2D (CMT2D) models. Conversely, inactivation of the ribosome rescue factor GTPBP2 exacerbated peripheral neuropathy. Our findings suggest a molecular mechanism for CMT2D, and elevating tRNAGly levels may thus have therapeutic potential.	0
Title: Mapping tenascin-C interaction with toll-like receptor 4 reveals a new subset of endogenous inflammatory triggers Abstract: Pattern recognition underpins innate immunity; the accurate identification of danger, including infection, injury, or tumor, is key to an appropriately targeted immune response. Pathogen detection is increasingly well defined mechanistically, but the discrimination of endogenous inflammatory triggers remains unclear. Tenascin-C, a matrix protein induced upon tissue damage and expressed by tumors, activates toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)-mediated sterile inflammation. Here we map three sites within tenascin-C that directly and cooperatively interact with TLR4. We also identify a conserved inflammatory epitope in related proteins from diverse families, and demonstrate that its presence targets molecules for TLR detection, while its absence enables escape of innate immune surveillance. These data reveal a unique molecular code that defines endogenous proteins as inflammatory stimuli by marking them for recognition by TLRs.	0
Title: A gene cluster from Streptomyces galilaeus involved in glycosylation of aclarubicin Abstract: We have cloned and characterized a gene cluster for anthracycline biosynthesis from Streptomyces galilaeus. This cluster, 15-kb long, includes eight genes involved in the deoxyhexose biosynthesis pathway, a gene for a glycosyltransferase and one for an activator, as well as two genes involved in aglycone biosynthesis. Gene disruption targeted to the activator gene blocked production of aclacinomycins in S. galilaeus. Plasmid pSgs4, containing genes for a glycosyltransferase (aknS), an aminomethylase (aknX), a glucose-1-phosphate thymidylyltransferase (akn Y) and two genes for unidentified glycosylation functions (aknT and aknV), restored the production of aclacinomycins in the S. galilaeus mutants H063, which accumulates aklavinone, and H054, which produces aklavinone with rhodinose and deoxyfucose residues. Furthermore, pSgs4 directed the production of L-rhamnosyl-epsilon-rhodomycinone and L-daunosaminyl-epsilon-rhodomycinone in S. peucetius strains that produce epsilon-rhodomycinone endogenously. Subcloning of the gene cluster was carried out in order to further define the genes that are responsible for complementation and hybrid anthracycline generation.	1
Title: Microbial diversity and heterogeneity in sandy subsurface soils Abstract: Microbial community diversity and heterogeneity in saturated and unsaturated subsurface soils from Abbott's Pit in Virginia (1.57, 3.25, and 4.05 m below surface) and Dover Air Force Base in Delaware (6.00 and 7.50 m below surface) were analyzed using a culture-independent small-subunit (SSU) rRNA gene (rDNA)-based cloning approach. Four to six dominant operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were identified in 33 to 100 unique SSU rDNA clones (constituting about 40 to 50% of the total number of SSU rDNA clones in the clone library) from the saturated subsurface samples, whereas no dominant OTUs were observed in the unsaturated subsurface sample. Less than 10% of the clones among samples from different depths at the same location were identical, and the proportion of overlapping OTUs was lower for the samples that were vertically far apart than for adjacent samples. In addition, no OTUs were shared between the Abbott's Pit and Dover samples. The majority of the clones (80%) had sequences that were less than 5% different from those in the current databases. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that most of the bacterial clones were affiliated with members of the Proteobacteria family (90%), gram-positive bacteria (3%), and members of the Acidobacteria family (3%). Principal component analysis revealed that samples from different geographic locations were well separated and that samples from the same location were closely grouped together. In addition, the nonsaturated subsurface samples from Abbott's Pit clustered together and were well separated from the saturated subsurface soil sample. Finally, the overall diversity of the subsurface samples was much lower than that of the corresponding surface soil samples.	0
Title: Discovery of Polycyclic Macrolide Shuangdaolides by Heterologous Expression of a Cryptic trans-AT PKS Gene Cluster Abstract: A cryptic trans-acyltransferase polyketide synthase biosynthetic gene cluster sdl (80 kb) from Streptomyces sp. B59 was cloned and transferred into a heterologous host Streptomyces albus J1074, resulting in a class of polycyclic macrolide shuangdaolides A-D (1-4) and dumulmycin (5). Heterologous expression and gene inactivation experiments allowed the identification of two biosynthetic intermediates, 6 and 7, suggesting an unusual multidomain SDR oxidoreductase SdlR in charge of the formation of a rare 2-hydroxycyclopentenone moiety in this class of compounds.	1
Title: Strategies for Site-Specific Labeling of Receptor Proteins on the Surfaces of Living Cells by Using Genetically Encoded Peptide Tags Abstract: Fluorescence microscopy imaging enables receptor proteins to be investigated within their biological context. A key challenge is to site-specifically incorporate reporter moieties into proteins without interfering with biological functions or cellular networks. Small peptide tags offer the opportunity to combine inducible labeling with small tag sizes that avoid receptor perturbation. Herein, we review the current state of live-cell labeling of peptide-tagged cell-surface proteins. Considering their importance as targets in medicinal chemistry, we focus on membrane receptors such as G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs). We discuss peptide tags that i) are subject to enzyme-mediated modification reactions, ii) guide the complementation of reporter proteins, iii) form coiled-coil complexes, and iv) interact with metal complexes. Given our own contributions in the field, we place emphasis on peptide-templated labeling chemistry.	0
Title: Chemical reporter for visualizing metabolic cross-talk between carbohydrate metabolism and protein modification Abstract: Metabolic chemical reporters have been largely used to study posttranslational modifications. Generally, it was assumed that these reporters entered one biosynthetic pathway, resulting in labeling of one type of modification. However, because they are metabolized by cells before their addition onto proteins, metabolic chemical reporters potentially provide a unique opportunity to read-out on both modifications of interest and cellular metabolism. We report here the development of a metabolic chemical reporter 1-deoxy-N-pentynyl glucosamine (1-deoxy-GlcNAlk). This small-molecule cannot be incorporated into glycans; however, treatment of mammalian cells results in labeling of a variety proteins and enables their visualization and identification. Competition of this labeling with sodium acetate and an acetyltransferase inhibitor suggests that 1-deoxy-GlcNAlk can enter the protein acetylation pathway. These results demonstrate that metabolic chemical reporters have the potential to isolate and potentially discover cross-talk between metabolic pathways in living cells.	0
Title: Biochemical characterization of the beta-1,4-glucuronosyltransferase GelK in the gellan gum-producing strain Sphingomonas paucimobilis A.T.C.C. 31461 Abstract: Biosynthesis of bacterial polysaccharide-repeat units proceeds by sequential transfer of sugars, from the appropriate sugar donor to an activated lipid carrier, by committed glycosyltransferases (GTs). Few studies on the mechanism of action for this type of GT are available. Sphingomonas paucimobilis A.T.C.C. 31461 produces the industrially important polysaccharide gellan gum. We have cloned the gelK gene from S. paucimobilis A.T.C.C. 31461. GelK belongs to family 1 of the GT classification [Campbell, Davies, Bulone, Henrissat (1997) Biochem. J. 326, 929-939]. Sequence similarity studies suggest that GelK consists of two protein modules corresponding to the -NH(2) and -CO(2)H halves, the latter possibly harbouring the GT activity. The gelK gene and the open reading frames coding for the -NH(2) (GelK(NH2)) and -CO(2)H (GelK(COOH)) halves were overexpressed in Escherichia coli. GelK and GelK(NH2) were present in both the soluble and membrane fractions of E. coli, whereas GelK(COOH) was only present in the soluble fraction. GelK catalysed the transfer of [(14)C]glucuronic acid from UDP-[(14)C]glucuronic acid into a glycolipid extracted from S. paucimobilis or E. coli, even in the presence of EDTA, and the radioactive sugar was released from the glycolipid by beta-1,4-glucuronidase. GelK was not able to use synthetic glucosyl derivatives as acceptors, indicating that the PP(i)-lipid moiety is needed for enzymic activity. Recombinant GelK(NH2) and GelK(COOH) did not show detectable activity. Based on the biochemical characteristics of GelK and on sequence similarities with N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase, we propose that GT families 1 and 28 form a superfamily.	1
Title: Identification of ε-Poly-L-lysine as an Antimicrobial Product from an Epichloë Endophyte and Isolation of Fungal ε-PL Synthetase Gene Abstract: The endophytic fungus Epichloë festucae is known to produce bioactive metabolites, which consequently protect the host plants from biotic and abiotic stresses. We previously found that the overexpression of vibA (a gene for transcription factor) in E. festucae strain E437 resulted in the secretion of an unknown fungicide. In the present study, the active substance was purified and chemically identified as ε-poly-L-lysine (ε-PL), which consisted of 28-34 lysine units. The productivity was 3.7-fold compared with that of the wild type strain E437. The isolated ε-PL showed inhibitory activity against the spore germination of the plant pathogens Drechslera erythrospila, Botrytis cinerea, and Phytophthora infestans at 1-10 μg/mL. We also isolated the fungal gene "epls" encoding ε-PL synthetase Epls. Overexpression of epls in the wild type strain E437 resulted in the enhanced production of ε-PL by 6.7-fold. Interestingly, overexpression of epls in the different strain E. festucae Fl1 resulted in the production of shorter ε-PL with 8-20 lysine, which exhibited a comparable antifungal activity to the longer one. The results demonstrate the first example of ε-PL synthetase gene from the eukaryotic genomes and suggest the potential of enhanced expression of vibA or/and epls genes in the Epichloë endophyte for constructing pest-tolerant plants.	1
Title: An adaptable luminescence resonance energy transfer assay for measuring and screening protein-protein interactions and their inhibition Abstract: Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are central to biological processes and represent an important class of therapeutic targets. Here we show that the interaction between FK506-binding protein 12 fused to green fluorescent protein (GFP-FKBP) and the rapamycin-binding domain of mTor fused to Escherichia coli dihydrofolate reductase (FRB-eDHFR) can be sensitively detected (signal-to-background ratio (S/B)>100) and accurately quantified within an impure cell lysate matrix using a luminescence resonance energy transfer (LRET) assay. Ascomycin-mediated inhibition of GFP-FKBP-rapamycin-FRB-eDHFR complex formation was also detected at high S/B ratio (>80) and Z'-factor (0.89). The method leverages the selective, stable binding of trimethoprim (TMP)-terbium complex conjugates to eDHFR, and time-resolved, background-free detection of the long-lifetime (∼ms) terbium-to-GFP LRET signal that indicates target binding. TMP-eDHFR labeling can be adapted to develop high-throughput screening assays and complementary, quantitative counter-screens for a wide variety of PPI targets with a broad range of affinities that may not be amenable to purification.	0
Title: Discovery of Influenza Polymerase PA-PB1 Interaction Inhibitors Using an In Vitro Split-Luciferase Complementation-Based Assay Abstract: The limited therapeutic options and increasing drug-resistance call for next-generation influenza antivirals. Due to the essential function in viral replication and high sequence conservation among influenza viruses, influenza polymerase PA-PB1 protein-protein interaction becomes an attractive drug target. Here, we developed an in vitro split luciferase complementation-based assay to speed up screening of PA-PB1 interaction inhibitors. By screening 10,000 compounds, we identified two PA-PB1 interaction inhibitors, R160792 and R151785, with potent and broad-spectrum antiviral activity against a panel of influenza A and B viruses, including amantadine-, oseltamivir-, or dual resistant strains. Further mechanistic study reveals that R151785 inhibits PA nuclear localization, reduces the levels of viral RNAs and proteins, and inhibits viral replication at the intermediate stage, all of which are in line with its antiviral mechanism of action. Overall, we developed a robust high throughput-screening assay for screening broad-spectrum influenza antivirals targeting PA-PB1 interaction and identified R151785 as a promising antiviral drug candidate.	0
Title: The Neisseria gonorrhoeae Obg protein is an essential ribosome-associated GTPase and a potential drug target Abstract: Background:                       Neisseria gonorrhoeae (GC) is a Gram-negative pathogen that most commonly infects mucosal surfaces, causing sexually transmitted urethritis in men and endocervicitis in women. Serious complications associated with these infections are frequent and include pelvic inflammatory disease, ectopic pregnancy, and infertility. The incidence of gonorrhea cases remains high globally while antibiotic treatment options, the sole counter measures against gonorrhea, are declining due to the remarkable ability of GC to acquire resistance. Evaluating of potential drug targets is essential to provide opportunities for developing antimicrobials with new mechanisms of action. We propose the GC Obg protein, belonging to the Obg/CgtA GTPase subfamily, as a potential target for the development of therapeutic interventions against gonorrhea, and in this study perform its initial functional and biochemical characterization.                  Results:                       We report that NGO1990 encodes Obg protein, which is an essential factor for GC viability, associates predominantly with the large 50S ribosomal subunit, and is stably expressed under conditions relevant to infection of the human host. The anti-Obg antisera cross-reacts with a panel of contemporary GC clinical isolates, demonstrating the ubiquitous nature of Obg. The cellular levels of Obg reach a maximum in the early logarithmic phase and remain constant throughout bacterial growth. The in vitro binding and hydrolysis of the fluorescent guanine nucleotide analogs mant-GTP and mant-GDP by recombinant wild type and T192AT193A mutated variants of Obg are also assessed.                  Conclusions:                       Characterization of the GC Obg at the molecular and functional levels presented herein may facilitate the future targeting of this protein with small molecule inhibitors and the evaluation of identified lead compounds for bactericidal activity against GC and other drug-resistant bacteria.	0
Title: Fine-tuning the regulation of Cas9 expression levels for efficient CRISPR-Cas9 mediated recombination in Streptomyces Abstract: CRISPR-Cas9 has proven as a very powerful gene editing tool for Actinomyces, allowing scarless and precise genome editing in selected strains of these biotechnologically relevant microorganisms. However, its general application in actinomycetes has been limited due to its inefficacy when applying the system in an untested strain. Here, we provide evidence of how Cas9 levels are toxic for the model actinomycetes Streptomyces coelicolor M145 and Streptomyces lividans TK24, which show delayed or absence of growth. We overcame this toxicity by lowering Cas9 levels and have generated a set of plasmids in which Cas9 expression is either controlled by theophylline-inducible or constitutive promoters. We validated the targeting of these CRISPR-Cas9 system using the glycerol uptake operon and the actinorhodin biosynthesis gene cluster. Our results highlight the importance of adjusting Cas9 expression levels specifically in strains to gain optimum and efficient gene editing in Actinomyces.	0
Title: Resolving DNA at efficiencies of more than a million plates per meter using bare narrow open capillaries without sieving matrices Abstract: We report a novel approach for effectively separating DNA molecules in free solution. The method uses a bare narrow open capillary without any sieving matrices to resolve a wide size-range of DNA fragments at efficiencies of more than a million plates per meter routinely.	0
Title: Highly efficient Cu(I)-catalyzed oxidation of alcohols to ketones and aldehydes with diaziridinone Abstract: A novel and efficient Cu(I)-catalyzed oxidation of alcohols has been achieved with di-tert-butyldiaziridinone as the oxidant under mild conditions. A wide variety of primary and secondary alcohols with various functional groups can be oxidized to aldehydes and ketones in high yields. The reaction proceeds under neutral conditions making it compatible with acid- or base-sensitive substrates, and it is amenable to gram scale.	0
Title: In vitro characterization of echinomycin biosynthesis: formation and hydroxylation of L-tryptophanyl-S-enzyme and oxidation of (2S,3S) β-hydroxytryptophan Abstract: Quinoxaline-2-carboxylic acid (QXC) and 3-hydroxyquinaldic acid (HQA) feature in quinomycin family and confer anticancer activity. In light of the significant potency against cancer, the biosynthetic gene clusters have been reported from many different Streptomyces strains, and the biosynthetic pathway were proposed mainly based on the in vivo feeding experiment with isotope labeled putative intermediates. Herein we report another gene cluster from Streptomyces griseovariabilis subsp. bandungensis subsp. nov responsible for the biosynthesis of echinomycin (a member of quinomycin family, also named quinomycin A) and presented in vitro evidence to corroborate the previous hypothesis on QXC biosynthesis, showing that only with the assistance of a MbtH-like protein Qui5, did the didomain NRPS protein (Qui18) perform the loading of a L-tryptophan onto its own PCP domain. Particularly, it was found that Qui5 and Qui18 subunits form a functional tetramer through size exclusion chromatography. The subsequent hydroxylation on β-carbon of the loaded L-tryptophan proved in vitro to be completed by cytochrome P450-dependent hydroxylase Qui15. Importantly, only the Qui18 loaded L-tryptophan can be hydroxylated by Qui15 and the enzyme was inactive on free L-tryptophan. Additionally, the chemically synthesized (2S,3S) β-hydroxytryptophan was detected to be converted by the tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase Qui17 through LC-MS, which enriched our previous knowledge that tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase nearly exclusively acted on L-tryptophan and 6-fluoro-tryptophan.	1
Title: The BCCT family of carriers: from physiology to crystal structure Abstract: Increases in the environmental osmolarity are key determinants for the growth of microorganisms. To ensure a physiologically acceptable level of cellular hydration and turgor at high osmolarity, many bacteria accumulate compatible solutes. Osmotically controlled uptake systems allow the scavenging of these compounds from scarce environmental sources as effective osmoprotectants. A number of these systems belong to the BCCT family (betaine-choline-carnitine-transporter), sodium- or proton-coupled transporters (e.g. BetP and BetT respectively) that are ubiquitous in microorganisms. The BCCT family also contains CaiT, an L-carnitine/γ-butyrobetaine antiporter that is not involved in osmotic stress responses. The glycine betaine transporter BetP from Corynebacterium glutamicum is a representative for osmoregulated symporters of the BCCT family and functions both as an osmosensor and osmoregulator. The crystal structure of BetP in an occluded conformation in complex with its substrate glycine betaine and two crystal structures of CaiT in an inward-facing open conformation in complex with L-carnitine and γ-butyrobetaine were reported recently. These structures and the wealth of biochemical data on the activity control of BetP in response to osmotic stress enable a correlation between the sensing of osmotic stress by a transporter protein with the ensuing regulation of transport activity. Molecular determinants governing the high-affinity binding of the compatible solutes by BetP and CaiT, the coupling in symporters and antiporters, and the osmoregulatory properties are discussed in detail for BetP and various BCCT carriers.	0
Title: Probing Labdane-Related Diterpenoid Biosynthesis in the Fungal Genus Aspergillus Abstract: While terpenoid production is generally associated with plants, a variety of fungi contain operons predicted to lead to such biosynthesis. Notably, fungi contain a number of cyclases characteristic of labdane-related diterpenoid metabolism, which have not been much explored. These also are often found near cytochrome P450 (CYP) mono-oxygenases that presumably further decorate the ensuing diterpene, suggesting that these fungi might produce more elaborate diterpenoids. To probe the functional diversity of such biosynthetic capacity, an investigation of the phylogenetically diverse cyclases and associated CYPs from the fungal genus Aspergillus was undertaken, revealing their ability to produce isopimaradiene-derived diterpenoids. Intriguingly, labdane-related diterpenoid biosynthetic genes are largely found in plant-associated fungi, hinting that these natural products may play a role in such interactions. Accordingly, it is hypothesized here that isopimarane production may assist the plant-saprophytic lifestyle of Aspergillus fungi.	0
Title: NMR studies of the phosphotransfer domain of the histidine kinase CheA from Escherichia coli: assignments, secondary structure, general fold, and backbone dynamics Abstract: Multidimensional heteronuclear NMR techniques were applied to study the phosphotransfer domain, residues 1-134, of the histidine kinase CheA, from Escherichia coli, which contains the site of autophosphorylation, His48. Assignments of the backbone amide groups and side chain protons are nearly complete. Our studies show that this protein fragment consists of five alpha-helices (A-E) connected by turns. Analysis of NOE distance restraints provided by two-dimensional (2D) 1H-1H and three-dimensional (3D) 15N-edited NOESY spectra using model building and structure calculations indicates that the five helices form an antiparallel helix bundle with near-neighbor connectivity. The amino-terminal four helices are proposed to be arranged in a right-handed manner with helix E packing against helices C and D. From ideal hydrophobic helical packing and structure calculations, the site of autophosphorylation, His48, is nearly fully exposed to the solvent. We measured the NMR relaxation properties of the backbone 15N nuclei using inverse detected two-dimensional NMR spectroscopy. The protein backbone dynamics studies show that CheA1-134 is formed into a tight and compact structure with very limited flexibilities both in helices and turns.

Title: Crystal structure of the ECH2 catalytic domain of CurF from Lyngbya majuscula. Insights into a decarboxylase involved in polyketide chain beta-branching Abstract: Curacin A is a mixed polyketide/nonribosomal peptide possessing anti-mitotic and anti-proliferative activity. In the biosynthesis of curacin A, the N-terminal domain of the CurF multifunctional protein catalyzes decarboxylation of 3-methylglutaconyl-acyl carrier protein (ACP) to 3-methylcrotonyl-ACP, the postulated precursor of the cyclopropane ring of curacin A. This decarboxylase is encoded within an "HCS cassette" that is used by several other polyketide biosynthetic systems to generate chemical diversity by introduction of a beta-branch functional group to the natural product. The crystal structure of the CurF N-terminal ECH(2) domain establishes that the protein is a crotonase superfamily member. Ala(78) and Gly(118) form an oxyanion hole in the active site that includes only three polar side chains as potential catalytic residues. Site-directed mutagenesis and a biochemical assay established critical functions for His(240) and Lys(86), whereas Tyr(82) was nonessential. A decarboxylation mechanism is proposed in which His(240) serves to stabilize the substrate carboxylate and Lys(86) donates a proton to C-4 of the acyl-ACP enolate intermediate to form the Delta(2) unsaturated isopentenoyl-ACP product. The CurF ECH(2) domain showed a 20-fold selectivity for ACP-over CoA-linked substrates. Specificity for ACP-linked substrates has not been reported for any other crotonase superfamily decarboxylase. Tyr(73) may select against CoA-linked substrates by blocking a contact of Arg(38) with the CoA adenosine 5'-phosphate.	1
Title: Identification of a fluorometabolite from Streptomyces sp. MA37: (2 R 3 S 4 S)-5-fluoro-2,3,4-trihydroxypentanoic acid Abstract: (2R3S4S)-5-Fluoro-2,3,4-trihydroxypentanoic acid (5-FHPA) has been discovered as a new fluorometabolite in the soil bacterium Streptomyces sp. MA37. Exogenous addition of 5-fluoro-5-deoxy-d-ribose (5-FDR) into the cell free extract of MA37 demonstrated that 5-FDR was an intermediate to a range of unidentified fluorometabolites, distinct from fluoroacetate (FAc) and 4-fluorothreonine (4-FT). Bioinformatics analysis allowed identification of a gene cluster (fdr), encoding a pathway to the biosynthesis of 5-FHPA. Over-expression and in vitro assay of FdrC indicated that FdrC is a NAD+ dependent dehydrogenase responsible for oxidation of 5-FDR into 5-fluoro-5-deoxy-lactone, followed by hydrolysis to 5-FHPA. The identity of 5-FHPA in the fermentation broth was confirmed by synthesis of a reference compound and then co-correlation by 19F-NMR and GC-MS analysis. The occurrence of 5-FHPA proves the existence of a new fluorometabolite pathway.	1
Title: Radical-mediated enzymatic carbon chain fragmentation-recombination Abstract: The radical S-adenosylmethionine (S-AdoMet) superfamily contains thousands of proteins that catalyze highly diverse conversions, most of which are poorly understood, owing to a lack of information regarding chemical products and radical-dependent transformations. We here report that NosL, involved in forming the indole side ring of the thiopeptide nosiheptide (NOS), is a radical S-AdoMet 3-methyl-2-indolic acid (MIA) synthase. NosL catalyzed an unprecedented carbon chain reconstitution of L-tryptophan to give MIA, showing removal of the Cα-N unit and shift of the carboxylate to the indole ring. Dissection of the enzymatic process upon the identification of products and a putative glycyl intermediate uncovered a radical-mediated, unusual fragmentation-recombination reaction. This finding unveiled a key step in radical S-AdoMet enzyme-catalyzed structural rearrangements during complex biotransformations. Additionally, NosL tolerated fluorinated L-tryptophan as the substrate, allowing for production of a regiospecifically halogenated thiopeptide that has not been found among the more than 80 members of the naturally occurring thiopeptide family.	0
Title: Deposition Bias of Chromatin Proteins Inverts under DNA Replication Stress Conditions Abstract: Following DNA replication, equal amounts of chromatin proteins are distributed over sister chromatids by re-deposition of parental chromatin proteins and deposition of newly synthesized chromatin proteins. Molecular mechanisms balancing the allocation of new and old chromatin proteins remain largely unknown. Here, we studied the genome-wide distribution of new chromatin proteins relative to parental DNA template strands and replication initiation zones using the double-click-seq. Under control conditions, new chromatin proteins were preferentially found on DNA replicated by the lagging strand machinery. Strikingly, replication stress induced by hydroxyurea or curaxin treatment and inhibition of ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related protein (ATR) or p53 inactivation inverted the observed chromatin protein deposition bias to the strand replicated by the leading strand polymerase in line with previously reported effects on replication protein A occupancy. We propose that asymmetric deposition of newly synthesized chromatin proteins onto sister chromatids reflects differences in the processivity of leading and lagging strand synthesis.	0
Title: Cyanobacterial Dihydroxyacid Dehydratases Are a Promising Growth Inhibition Target Abstract: Microbes are essential to the global ecosystem, but undesirable microbial growth causes issues ranging from food spoilage and infectious diseases to harmful cyanobacterial blooms. The use of chemicals to control microbial growth has achieved significant success, while specific roles for a majority of essential genes in growth control remain unexplored. Here, we show the growth inhibition of cyanobacterial species by targeting an essential enzyme for the biosynthesis of branched-chain amino acids. Specifically, we report the biochemical, genetic, and structural characterization of dihydroxyacid dehydratase from the model cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 (SnDHAD). Our studies suggest that SnDHAD is an oxygen-stable enzyme containing a [2Fe-2S] cluster. Furthermore, we demonstrate that SnDHAD is selectively inhibited in vitro and in vivo by the natural product aspterric acid, which also inhibits the growth of representative bloom-forming Microcystis and Anabaena strains but has minimal effects on microbial pathogens with [4Fe-4S] containing DHADs. This study suggests DHADs as a promising target for the precise growth control of microbes and highlights the exploration of other untargeted essential genes for microbial management.	0
Title: Synthesis of the isoxazolo[4,3,2-de]phenanthridinone moiety of the parnafungins Abstract: A practical route to the labile tetracyclic isoxazolo[4,3,2-de]phenanthridinone moiety of the antifungal parnafungins has been developed. Zinc reduction of a methyl 2'-hydroxymethyl-2-nitro-3-biphenylcarboxylate, which was prepared by a Suzuki coupling, afforded a benzisoxazolone that was treated with MsCl and base to generate the labile tetracyclic ring system in 37-47% yield. This compound decomposes to the phenanthridine in CDCl(3) and the phenanthridine N-oxide in aqueous base.	0
Title: Insights into the bioactivity of mensacarcin and epoxide formation by MsnO8 Abstract: Mensacarcin, a potential antitumour drug, is produced by Streptomyces bottropensis. The structure consists of a three-membered ring system with many oxygen atoms. Of vital importance in this context is an epoxy moiety in the side chain of mensacarcin. Our studies with different mensacarcin derivatives have demonstrated that this epoxy group is primarily responsible for the cytotoxic effect of mensacarcin. In order to obtain further information about this epoxy moiety, inactivation experiments in the gene cluster were carried out to identify the epoxy-forming enzyme. Therefore the cosmid cos2, which covers almost the complete type II polyketide synthase (PKS) gene cluster, was heterologously expressed in Streptomyces albus. This led to production of didesmethylmensacarcin, due to the fact that methyltransferase genes are missing in the cosmid. Further gene inactivation experiments on this cosmid showed that MsnO8, a luciferase-like monooxygenase, introduces the epoxy group at the end of the biosynthesis of mensacarcin. In addition, the protein MsnO8 was purified, and its crystal structure was determined to a resolution of 1.80 Å.	1
Title: Identification of a monooxygenase from Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) involved in biosynthesis of actinorhodin: purification and characterization of the recombinant enzyme Abstract: The oxidation of phenols to quinones is an important reaction in the oxidative tailoring of many aromatic polyketides from bacterial and fungal systems. Sequence similarity between ActVA-Orf6 protein from the actinorhodin biosynthetic cluster and the previously characterized TcmH protein that is involved in tetracenomycin biosynthesis suggested that ActVA-Orf6 might catalyze this transformation as a step in actinorhodin biosynthesis. To investigate the role of ActVA-Orf6 in this oxidation, we have expressed the actVA-Orf6 gene in Escherichia coli and purified and characterized the recombinant protein. ActVA-Orf6 was shown to catalyze the monooxygenation of the tetracenomycin intermediate TcmF1 to TcmD3, strongly suggesting that it catalyzes oxidation of a similar intermediate in actinorhodin biosynthesis. The monooxygenase obeys simple reaction kinetics and has a Km of 4.8 +/- 0.9 microM, close to the figure reported for the homologous enzyme TcmH. The enzyme contains no prosthetic groups and requires only molecular oxygen to catalyze the oxidation. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to investigate the role of histidine residues thought to be important in the reaction; mutants lacking His-52 displayed much-reduced activity, consistent with the proposed mechanistic hypothesis that this histidine acts as a general base during catalysis.	1
Title: OxyR is involved in coordinate regulation of expression of fimA and sod genes in Porphyromonas gingivalis Abstract: Survival of Porphyromonas gingivalis in the constantly changing oral environment depends on its ability to alter gene expression. We demonstrate here that P. gingivalis activates superoxide dismutase expression in response to oxidative stress and represses expression of FimA, a subunit of major fimbriae. Coordinated expression of fimA and sod is regulated by the redox-sensing transcription factor OxyR. Mutations in the oxyR gene result in a decreased expression of sod and in an elevated expression of fimA. In addition, we provide evidence that regulation of expression of fimA and sod by OxyR is mediated by direct interaction of OxyR and the promoters of these two genes. These results suggest that OxyR plays an important role in regulation of expression of virulence genes in P. gingivalis.	0
Title: Analysis of protease-sensitive regions in the skeletal muscle sodium channel in vitro and implications for channel tertiary structure Abstract: The tertiary structure of the rat skeletal muscle sodium channel was probed in vitro by determining regions of sensitivity to V-8 protease, trypsin, and chymotrypsin. Resultant channel fragments were identified with antibodies to defined sequences distributed along the primary structure. The temporal pattern of proteolysis was followed with channel protein in either detergent-phospholipid micelles or membrane fragments as well as with channel exposed to sodium dodecyl sulfate. Proteolysis in micelles and membranes occurred in discrete, reproducible steps that were similar in both systems. Although the size of intermediates varied slightly, their sequence of appearance was similar for all enzymes, suggesting that the observed pattern was determined by the relative accessibility of selected sites in the tertiary structure. No major change in channel organization appeared to occur after solubilization of membranes in nonionic detergents. Highly accessible sites in the native structure included the carboxyl terminus and the region linking the second and third internal repeat domains, while the amino terminus and the repeat domains themselves were relatively resistant to proteolysis unless the protein was denatured. Kinetically, interdomain II-III was the most readily cleaved; interdomains I-II and especially III-IV were less easily accessible. While domains I and IV appeared to remain intact throughout our experiments, limit fragments for epitopes associated with domains II and III suggest that cleavage eventually occurs at sites between the putative S5 and S6 helices in these domains.	0
Title: Quantitative detection of Porphyromonas gingivalis fimA genotypes in dental plaque Abstract: We developed quantitative fimA genotype assays and applied them in a pilot study investigating the fimbrial genotype distribution of Porphyromonas gingivalis in European subjects with or without chronic periodontitis. P. gingivalis was found in 71% and 9% of the samples from patients and healthy subjects, respectively. Enumeration of total P. gingivalis cell numbers by polymerase chain reaction and immunofluorescence showed excellent correspondence (r = 0.964). 73% of positive samples contained multiple fimA genotypes, but generally one genotype predominated by one to three orders of magnitude. Genotype II predominated in 60% of the samples. Genotype IV occurred with similar prevalence (73%) as genotype II but predominated in only 20% of the samples. Genotypes I, III and V were of much lower prevalence and cell densities of the latter two remained sparse. Our results suggest marked differences among the fimA genotypes' ability to colonize host sites with high cell numbers.	0
Title: The biology of vision of Drosophila Abstract: Phototransduction systems in vertebrates and invertebrates share a great deal of similarity in overall strategy but differ significantly in the underlying molecular machinery. Both are rhodopsin-based G protein-coupled signaling cascades displaying exquisite sensitivity and broad dynamic range. However, light activation of vertebrate photoreceptors leads to activation of a cGMP-phosphodiesterase effector and the generation of a hyperpolarizing response. In contrast, activation of invertebrate photoreceptors, like Drosophila, leads to stimulation of phospholipase C and the generation of a depolarizing receptor potential. The comparative study of these two systems of phototransduction offers the opportunity to understand how similar biological problems may be solved by different molecular mechanisms of signal transduction. The study of this process in Drosophila, a system ideally suited to genetic and molecular manipulation, allows us to dissect the function and regulation of such a complex signaling cascade in its normal cellular environment. In this manuscript I review some of our recent findings and the strategies used to dissect this process.	0
Title: Beta hydroxylation of glycolipids from Ustilago maydis and Pseudozyma flocculosa by an NADPH-dependent β-hydroxylase Abstract: Flocculosin and ustilagic acid (UA), two highly similar antifungal cellobiose lipids, are respectively produced by Pseudozyma flocculosa, a biocontrol agent, and Ustilago maydis, a plant pathogen. Both glycolipids contain a short-chain fatty acid hydroxylated at the β position but differ in the long fatty acid, which is hydroxylated at the α position in UA and at the β position in flocculosin. In both organisms, the biosynthesis genes are arranged in large clusters. The functions of most genes have already been characterized, but those of the P. flocculosa fhd1 gene and its homolog from U. maydis, uhd1, have remained undefined. The deduced amino acid sequences of these genes show homology to those of short-chain dehydrogenases and reductases (SDR). We disrupted the uhd1 gene in U. maydis and analyzed the secreted UA. uhd1 deletion strains produced UA lacking the β-hydroxyl group of the short-chain fatty acid. To analyze the function of P. flocculosa Fhd1, the corresponding gene was used to complement U. maydis Δuhd1 mutants. Fhd1 was able to restore wild-type UA production, indicating that Fhd1 is responsible for β hydroxylation of the flocculosin short-chain fatty acid. We also investigated a P. flocculosa homolog of the U. maydis long-chain fatty-acid alpha hydroxylase Ahd1. The P. flocculosa ahd1 gene, which does not reside in the flocculosin gene cluster, was introduced into U. maydis Δahd1 mutant strains. P. flocculosa Ahd1 neither complemented the U. maydis Δahd1 phenotype nor resulted in the production of β-hydroxylated UA. This suggests that P. flocculosa Ahd1 is not involved in flocculosin hydroxylation.	1
Title: Two pathways for pyrrole formation in coumermycin A(1) biosynthesis: the central pyrrole moiety is formed from L-threonine Abstract: Coumermycin A(1) is an aminocoumarin antibiotic produced by Streptomyces rishiriensis. It contains three pyrrole rings, that is, two terminal 5-methyl-pyrrole-2-carboxyl moieties and a central 3-methylpyrrole-2,4-dicarboxylic acid moiety. The biosynthesis of the terminal pyrrole moieties has been elucidated previously. However, the biosynthetic precursors of the central pyrrole moiety have remained unknown, and none of the genes or enzymes involved in its formation has been identified. We now show that five genes, contained in a contiguous 4.7 kb region within the coumermycin biosynthetic gene cluster, are required for the biosynthesis of this central pyrrole moiety. Each of these genes was deleted individually, resulting in a strong reduction or an abolishment of coumermycin production. External feeding of the central pyrrole moiety restored coumermycin production. One of these genes shows similarity to L-threonine kinase genes. Feeding of [U-(13)C,(15) N]L-threonine and (13)C NMR analysis of the resulting compound unequivocally proved that threonine was incorporated intact into the central pyrrole (19 % enrichment) to provide the heterocyclic nitrogen as well as four of the seven carbons of this moiety. Therefore, this pyrrole is formed via a new, hitherto unknown biosynthetic pathway. A hypothesis for the reaction sequence leading to the central pyrrole moiety of coumermycin A(1) is presented.	1
Title: Nucleotide sequence of the Salmonella typhimurium origin of DNA replication Abstract: Construction of deletion derivative plasmids and cloning of restriction fragments from plasmids containing the Salmonella typhimurium origin of replication (ori) were used to locate the functional origin to within a DNA fragment of 296 base pairs between the genes uncB and asn. The nucleotide sequence of the S. typhimurium ori region was determined and compared with the Escherichia coli ori sequence. In the 296-base pair fragment, 85.8% of the bases are conserved between the two species. A nearly equal number of transition and transversion type differences, with no insertions or deletions, occurs between the two bacterial origins, such that the relatively high percentage (adenine plus thymine) of 59.5% is conserved. The 296-base pair fragment contains 14 GATC sequences, all of which are conserved. The high frequency of occurrence of GATC, which is the site of methylation under control of the dam gene, may explain in part why the bacterial ori region appears to be so highly conserved. A large number of secondary structures are possible. One such structure, with a "cloverleaf," is favored by ori nucleotide sequence comparisons and leads to potential novel macromolecular interactions.	0
Title: Moso Bamboo Invasion Reshapes Community Structure of Denitrifying Bacteria in Rhizosphere of Alsophila spinulosa Abstract: The uncontrolled invasion of moso bamboo (Phyllostachys pubescens) dramatically alters soil nitrogen cycling and destroys the natural habitat of Alsophila spinulosa. Nevertheless, no clear evidence points out the role of denitrifying bacteria in the invasion of bamboo into the habitat of A. spinulosa. In the present study, we found that low (importance value 0.0008), moderate (0.6551), and high (0.9326) bamboo invasions dramatically altered the underground root biomass of both P. pubescens and A. spinulosa. The root biomass of A. spinulosa was maximal at moderate invasion, indicating that intermediate disturbance might contribute to the growth and survival of the colonized plant. Successful bamboo invasion significantly increased rhizospheric soil available nitrogen content of A. spinulosa, coupled with elevated denitrifying bacterial abundance and diversity. Shewanella, Chitinophaga, and Achromobacter were the primary genera in the three invasions, whereas high bamboo invasion harbored more denitrifying bacteria and higher abundance than moderate and low invasions. Further correlation analysis found that most soil denitrifying bacteria were positively correlated with soil organic matter and available nitrogen but negatively correlated with pH and water content. In addition, our findings illustrated that two denitrifying bacteria, Chitinophaga and Sorangium, might be essential indicators for evaluating the effects of bamboo invasion on the growth of A. spinulosa. Collectively, this study found that moso bamboo invasion could change the nitrogen cycling of colonized habitats through alterations of denitrifying bacteria and provided valuable perspectives for profound recognizing the invasive impacts and mechanisms of bamboo expansion.	0
Title: The sarco-endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase is required for development and muscle function in Caenorhabditis elegans Abstract: The sarco-endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-transport ATPase (SERCA) loads intracellular releasable Ca(2+) stores by transporting cytosolic Ca(2+) into the endoplasmic (ER) or sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). We characterized the only SERCA homologue of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, which is encoded by the sca-1 gene. The sca-1 transcript is alternatively spliced in a similar mode as the vertebrate SERCA2 transcript, giving rise to two protein variants: CeSERCAa and CeSERCAb. These proteins showed structural and functional conservation to the vertebrate SERCA2a/b proteins. The CeSERCAs were primarily expressed in contractile tissues. Loss of CeSERCA through gene ablation or RNA interference resulted in contractile dysfunctioning and in early larval or embryonic lethality, respectively. Similar defects could be induced pharmacologically using the SERCA-specific inhibitor thapsigargin, which bound CeSERCA at a conserved site. The conservation of SERCA2 homologues in C. elegans will allow genetic and chemical suppressor analyses to identify promising drug targets and lead molecules for treatment of SERCA-related diseases such as heart disease.	0
Title: Penicillium roqueforti PR toxin gene cluster characterization Abstract: PR toxin is a well-known isoprenoid mycotoxin almost solely produced by Penicillium roqueforti after growth on food or animal feed. This mycotoxin has been described as the most toxic produced by this species. In this study, an in silico analysis allowed identifying for the first time a 22.4-kb biosynthetic gene cluster involved in PR toxin biosynthesis in P. roqueforti. The pathway contains 11 open reading frames encoding for ten putative proteins including the major fungal terpene cyclase, aristolochene synthase, involved in the first farnesyl-diphosphate cyclization step as well as an oxidoreductase, an oxidase, two P450 monooxygenases, a transferase, and two dehydrogenase enzymes. Gene silencing was used to study three genes (ORF5, ORF6, and ORF8 encoding for an acetyltransferase and two P450 monooxygenases, respectively) and resulted in 20 to 40% PR toxin production reductions in all transformants proving the involvement of these genes and the corresponding enzyme activities in PR toxin biosynthesis. According to the considered silenced gene target, eremofortin A and B productions were also affected suggesting their involvement as biosynthetic intermediates in this pathway. A PR toxin biosynthesis pathway is proposed based on the most recent and available data.	1
Title: Characterization of a Citrulline 4-Hydroxylase from Nonribosomal Peptide GE81112 Biosynthesis and Engineering of Its Substrate Specificity for the Chemoenzymatic Synthesis of Enduracididine Abstract: The GE81112 tetrapeptides are a small family of unusual nonribosomal peptide congeners with potent inhibitory activity against prokaryotic translation initiation. With the exception of the 3-hydroxy-l-pipecolic acid unit, little is known about the biosynthetic origins of the non-proteinogenic amino acid monomers of the natural product family. Here, we elucidate the biogenesis of the 4-hydroxy-l-citrulline unit and establish the role of an iron- and α-ketoglutarate-dependent enzyme (Fe/αKG) in the pathway. Homology modelling and sequence alignment analysis further facilitate the rational engineering of this enzyme to become a specific 4-arginine hydroxylase. We subsequently demonstrate the utility of this engineered enzyme in the synthesis of a dipeptide fragment of the antibiotic enduracidin. This work highlights the value of applying a bioinformatics-guided approach in the discovery of novel enzymes and engineering of new catalytic activity into existing ones.	0
Title: Biosynthesis of steroidal antibiotic fusidanes: functional analysis of oxidosqualene cyclase and subsequent tailoring enzymes from Aspergillus fumigatus Abstract: Three putative oxidosqualene cyclase (OSC) genes exist in the genome of the fungus Aspergillus fumigatus that produces a steroidal antibiotic, helvolic acid. One of these genes, Afu4g14770, designated AfuOSC3, is clustered with genes of cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (P450s), a short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR), and acyltransferases, which presumably function in triterpene tailoring steps, suggesting that this gene cluster codes for helvolic acid biosynthesis. AfuOSC3 was PCR amplified from A. fumigatus IFO8866 genomic DNA and expressed in yeast. The yeast transformant accumulated protosta-17(20)Z,24-dien-3beta-ol, an established precursor for helvolic acid. Its structural isomer, (20R)-protosta-13(17),24-dien-3beta-ol, was also isolated from the transformed yeast. To further identify the function of triterpene tailoring enzymes, four P450 genes (CYP5081A1-D1) and a SDR gene (AfuSDR1) in the cluster were each coexpressed with AfuOSC3 in yeast. As a result, coexpression of AfuSDR1 gave a 3-keto derivative of protostadienol. On the other hand, coexpression with CYP5081A1 gave protosta-17(20)Z,24-diene-3beta,29-diol and protosta-17(20)Z,24-dien-3beta-ol-29-oic acid. These metabolites are in well accord with the oxidative modification involved in helvolic acid biosynthesis. AfuSDR1 and CYP5081A1 presumably function together to catalyze demethylation of C-29 methyl group. These results provided a firm ground for identification of the present gene cluster to be involved in helvolic acid biosynthesis.	1
Title: Development of Marine-Derived Compounds for Cancer Therapy Abstract: Cancer has always been a threat to human health with its high morbidity and mortality rates. Traditional therapy, including surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy, plays a key role in cancer treatment. However, it is not able to prevent tumor recurrence, drug resistance and treatment side effects, which makes it a very attractive challenge to search for new effective and specific anticancer drugs. Nature is a valuable source of multiple pharmaceuticals, and most of the anticancer drugs are natural products or derived from them. Marine-derived compounds, such as nucleotides, proteins, peptides and amides, have also shed light on cancer therapy, and they are receiving a fast-growing interest due to their bioactive properties. Their mechanisms contain anti-angiogenic, anti-proliferative and anti-metastasis activities; cell cycle arrest; and induction of apoptosis. This review provides an overview on the development of marine-derived compounds with anticancer properties, both their applications and mechanisms, and discovered technologies.	0
Title: Biosynthesis of microcystin hepatotoxins in the cyanobacterial genus Fischerella Abstract: Microcystins (MCs) are serine/threonine phosphatase inhibitors synthesized by several members of the phylum Cyanobacteria. Mining the draft genome sequence of the nostocalean MC-producing Fischerella sp. strain CENA161 led to the identification of three contigs containing mcy genes. Subsequent PCR and Sanger sequencing allowed the assembling of its complete biosynthetic mcy gene cluster with 55,016 bases in length. The cluster encoding ten genes (mcyA-J) with a central bidirectional promoter was organized in a similar manner as found in other genera of nostocalean cyanobacteria. However, the nucleotide sequence of the mcy gene cluster of Fischerella sp. CENA161 showed significant differences from all the other MC-producing cyanobacterial genera, sharing only 85.2 to 74.1% identities. Potential MC variants produced by Fischerella sp. CENA161 were predicted by the analysis of the adenylation domain binding pockets and further investigated by LC-MS/MS analysis. To our knowledge, this study presents the first complete mcy cluster characterization from a strain of the genus Fischerella, providing new insight into the distribution and evolution of MCs in the phylum Cyanobacteria.	1
Title: Cebulantin, a Cryptic Lanthipeptide Antibiotic Uncovered Using Bioactivity-Coupled HiTES Abstract: The majority of natural product biosynthetic gene clusters in bacteria are silent under standard laboratory growth conditions, making it challenging to uncover any antibiotics that they may encode. Herein, bioactivity assays are combined with high-throughput elicitor screening (HiTES) to access cryptic, bioactive metabolites. Application of this strategy in Saccharopolyspora cebuensis, with inhibition of Escherichia coli growth as a read-out, led to the identification of a novel lanthipeptide, cebulantin. Extensive NMR spectroscopic analysis allowed the elucidation of the structure of cebulantin. Subsequent bioactivity assays revealed it to be an antibiotic selective for Gram-negative bacteria, especially against Vibrio species. This approach, referred to as bioactivity-HiTES, has the potential to uncover cryptic metabolites with desired biological activities that are hidden in microbial genomes.	1
Title: The Stereocontrolled Biosynthesis of Mirror-Symmetric 2,4-Diaminobutyric Acid Homopolymers Is Critically Governed by Adenylation Activations Abstract: Among the four bioactive cationic homo-poly(amino acids) discovered in nature, two are mirror-image isomers of poly(2,4-diaminobutyric acid) (poly-Dab) whose biosynthesis has long been unexplained. Their structural analogy plausibly suggested that they could share a common biosynthetic pathway utilizing ε-poly(l-lysine) synthetase-like enzymology but with an unprecedented process for enantiomeric inversion of polymer building blocks. To investigate this possibility, we comparatively explored the biosynthesis of poly-l-Dab and its mirror-image isomer poly-d-Dab in Streptomyces celluloflavus USE31 and Streptoalloteichus hindustanus NBRC15115, respectively, through genome mining, genetic inactivation, and heterologous expression combined with biochemical assays. While they shared the same biosynthetic pathway, the poly-d-Dab biosynthetic gene cluster additionally harbored the racemase gene. The critical finding that poly-d-Dab synthetase, in contrast to the synthetase generating the l-isomer, selectively activated d-Dab through adenylation conclusively demonstrated that free diffusible d-Dab preactivationally generated by the racemase is directly activated to be incorporated into the polymer. Our study thus represents the first demonstration of the stereoselective biosynthesis of a nonribosomal peptide governed by adenylation activity for a d-amino acid other than alanine. In silico sequence comparison between poly-Dab synthetases allowed us to identify amino acid residues potentially responsible for the discrimination of Dab enantiomers. Our results will provide significant insight not only for the future discovery of novel bioactive cationic poly(amino acids) but also for the creation of designer nonribosomal peptides with d-configuration.	1
Title: Mechanistic insights into polycycle formation by reductive cyclization in ikarugamycin biosynthesis Abstract: Ikarugamycin is a member of the polycyclic tetramate macrolactams (PTMs) family of natural products with diverse biological activities. The biochemical mechanisms for the formation of polycyclic ring systems in PTMs remain elusive. The enzymatic mechanism of constructing an inner five-membered ring in ikarugamycin is reported. A three-gene-cassette ikaABC from the marine-derived Streptomyces sp. ZJ306 is sufficient for conferring ikarugamycin production in a heterologous host. IkaC catalyzes a reductive cyclization reaction to form the inner five-membered ring by a Michael addition-like reaction. This study provides the first biochemical evidence for polycycle formation in PTMs and suggests a reductive cyclization strategy which may be potentially applicable in general to the corresponding ring formation in other PTMs.	1
Title: Elucidation of Piericidin A1 biosynthetic locus revealed a thioesterase-dependent mechanism of α-pyridone ring formation Abstract: Piericidins are a class of α-pyridone antibiotics that inhibit mitochondrial respiratory chain and exhibit antimicrobial, antifungal, and antitumor activities. Sequential analysis of Streptomyces piomogeues var. Hangzhouwanensis genome revealed six modular polyketide synthases, an amidotransferase, two methyltransferases, and a monooxygenase for piericidin A1 production. Gene functional analysis and deletion results provide overview of the biosynthesis pathway. Furthermore, in vitro characterization of the terminal polyketide synthase module with the thioesterase domain using β-ketoacyl substrates was performed. That revealed a pathway where the α-pyridone ring formation is dependent on hydrolysis of the product β, δ-diketo carboxylic acid by the C-terminal thioesterase followed by amidation and cyclization. These findings set the stage to investigate unusual enzymatic mechanisms in α-pyridone antibiotics biosynthesis, provide a foundation for genome mining of α-pyridone antibiotics, and produce analogs by molecular engineering.	1
Title: Farnesides A and B, sesquiterpenoid nucleoside ethers from a marine-derived Streptomyces sp., strain CNT-372 from Fiji Abstract: Farnesides A and B (1, 2), linear sesquiterpenoids connected by ether links to a ribose dihydrouracil nucleoside, were isolated from a marine-derived Streptomyces sp., strain CNT-372, grown in saline liquid culture. The structures of the new compounds were assigned by comprehensive spectroscopic analysis primarily involving 1D and 2D NMR analysis and by comparison of spectroscopic data to the recently reported ribose nucleoside JBIR-68 (3). The farnesides are only the second example of this exceedingly rare class of microbial terpenoid nucleoside metabolites. Farneside A (1) was found to have modest antimalarial activity against the parasite Plasmodium falciparum.	0
Title: Proteinaceous receptors for the import of mitochondrial precursor proteins Abstract: Mild trypsin treatment of isolated Neurospora mitochondria strongly inhibits their ability to bind and import the precursors of several mitochondrial proteins. Evidence is presented for two proteins, the ADP/ATP carrier and the mitochondrial porin, that specific binding of the precursors to the outer surface of the mitochondria is affected by the protease treatment. We suggest that the receptors that mediate the import of these two precursors are proteinaceous. Treatment of mitochondria with elastase also inhibits the binding and import of the ADP/ATP carrier and the porin. In contrast the import of the precursors of subunits 2 and 9 of the mitochondrial proton-translocating ATPase was unaffected by elastase treatment at the concentrations used. We suggest that the import pathways of the latter two proteins are distinct from those of the ADP/ATP carrier and the porin.	0
Title: Aromatic-aromatic interactions enhance interfiber contacts for enzymatic formation of a spontaneously aligned supramolecular hydrogel Abstract: Anisotropy or alignment is a critical feature of functional soft materials in living organisms, but it remains a challenge for spontaneously generating anisotropic gel materials. Here we report a molecular design that increases intermolecular aromatic-aromatic interactions of hydrogelators during enzymatic hydrogelation for spontaneously forming an anisotropic hydrogel. This process, relying on both aromatic-aromatic interactions and enzyme catalysis, results in spontaneously aligned supramolecular nanofibers as the matrices of a monodomain hydrogel that exhibits significant birefringence. This work, as the first example of monodomain hydrogels formed via an enzymatic reaction, illustrates a new biomimetic approach for generating aligned anisotropic soft materials.	0
Title: Cretaceous origin of the unique prey-capture apparatus in mega-diverse genus: stem lineage of Steninae rove beetles discovered in Burmese amber Abstract: Stenus is the largest genus of rove beetles and the second largest among animals. Its evolutionary success was associated with the adhesive labial prey-capture apparatus, a unique apomorphy of that genus. Definite Stenus with prey-capture apparatus are known from the Cenozoic fossils, while the age and early evolution of Steninae was hardly ever hypothesized. Our study of several Cretaceous Burmese amber inclusions revealed a stem lineage of Steninae that possibly possesses the Stenus-like prey-capture apparatus. Phylogenetic analysis of extinct and extant taxa of Steninae and putatively allied subfamilies of Staphylinidae with parsimony and Bayesian approaches resolved the Burmese amber lineage as a member of Steninae. It justified the description of a new extinct stenine genus Festenus with two new species, F. robustus and F. gracilis. The Late Cretaceous age of Festenus suggests an early origin of prey-capture apparatus in Steninae that, perhaps, drove the evolution towards the crown Stenus. Our analysis confirmed the well-established sister relationships between Steninae and Euaesthetinae and resolved Scydmaeninae as their next closest relative, the latter having no stable position in recent phylogenetic studies of rove beetles. Close affiliation of Megalopsidiinae, a subfamily often considered as a sister group to Euaesthetinae + Steninae clade, is rejected.	0
Title: Rufomycins or Ilamycins: Naming Clarifications and Definitive Structural Assignments Abstract: Rufomycin and ilamycin are synonymous for the same class of cyclopeptides, currently encompassing 33 structurally characterized isolates and 9 semisynthetic derivatives. Elucidation of new structures prioritized the consolidation of the names and established the structures of four diastereoisomeric rufomycins with a 2-piperidinone, named rufomycins 4-7, including full 1H/13C NMR assignments. The characteristic HSQC cross-peak for the CH-5, the hemiaminal carbon in amino acid #5, allows assignment of the stereocenters C-4 and C-5 within this ring. Semisynthetic derivatives (rufomycinSS 1, 2, and 3) were prepared from a rufomycins 4 and 6 mixture to validate the structural assignments. Based on the X-ray crystal structures of rufomycins 2 and 4, considering the NMR differences of rufomycins 7 vs 4-6 compared to rufomycinSS 1 vs 2 and 3, and taking into account that two major conformers, A and B, occur in both rufomycinSS 2 and 3, structural modeling was pursued. Collectively, this paper discusses the NMR spectroscopic differences of the stereoisomers and their possible 3D conformers and correlates these with the anti-Mycobacterium tuberculosis activity. In addition, a look at the history prioritizes names and numbering schemes for this group of antibiotics and leads to consolidated nomenclature for all currently known members, natural and semisynthetic derivatives, and serves to accommodate future discoveries.	0
Title: Development of putative probiotics as feed additives: validation in a porcine-specific gastrointestinal tract model Abstract: Enforced restrictions on the use of antibiotics as growth promoters (AGPs) in animal production have prompted investigations into alternative feed additives in recent decades. Probiotics are currently the main feed additive used in livestock. However, the selection of probiotic candidates relies on human-based methods and little is known about the verification criteria for host-specific selection. We investigated the probiotic potential of Lactobacillus salivarius strains isolated from fed pig feces for their use as porcine feed additives. Two methods were developed that simulated the pig gastrointestinal (GI) tract and the intestinal epithelium, and these were compared with human-based in vitro methods and used for selecting porcine probiotics. Lactobacillus salivarius strain LS6 was identified as a promising probiotic strain for potential use as a porcine feed additive. This strain prevented disruption of the epithelial integrity of pig small intestine (PSI) cells by inhibiting the adherence of enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli K88. It also showed high survival rates in the in vitro pig GI tract model and good adhesion to PSI cells. We propose that host target-specific screening and validation methods are important tools in the development of effective probiotic feed additives, and this approach may support future-oriented agriculture.	0
Title: Characterization of the pyoluteorin biosynthetic gene cluster of Pseudomonas fluorescens Pf-5 Abstract: Ten genes (plt) required for the biosynthesis of pyoluteorin, an antifungal compound composed of a bichlorinated pyrrole linked to a resorcinol moiety, were identified within a 24-kb genomic region of Pseudomonas fluorescens Pf-5. The deduced amino acid sequences of eight plt genes were similar to the amino acid sequences of genes with known biosynthetic functions, including type I polyketide synthases (pltB, pltC), an acyl coenzyme A (acyl-CoA) dehydrogenase (pltE), an acyl-CoA synthetase (pltF), a thioesterase (pltG), and three halogenases (pltA, pltD, and pltM). Insertions of the transposon Tn5 or Tn3-nice or a kanamycin resistance gene in each of these genes abolished pyoluteorin production by Pf-5. The presumed functions of the eight plt products are consistent with biochemical transformations involved in pyoluteorin biosynthesis from proline and acetate precursors. Isotope labeling studies demonstrated that proline is the primary precursor to the dichloropyrrole moiety of pyoluteorin. The deduced amino acid sequence of the product of another plt gene, pltR, is similar to those of members of the LysR family of transcriptional activators. pltR and pltM are transcribed divergently from the pltLABCDEFG gene cluster, and a sequence with the characteristics of a LysR binding site was identified within the 486-bp intergenic region separating pltRM from pltLABCDEFG. Transcription of the pyoluteorin biosynthesis genes pltB, pltE, and pltF, assessed with transcriptional fusions to an ice nucleation reporter gene, was significantly greater in Pf-5 than in a pltR mutant of Pf-5. Therefore, PltR is proposed to be a transcriptional activator of linked pyoluteorin biosynthesis genes.	1
Title: Whole-cell display of Pyrococcus horikoshii glutamate decarboxylase in Escherichia coli for high-titer extracellular gamma-aminobutyric acid production Abstract: We investigated the effect of cell-surface display of glutamate decarboxylase (GadB) on gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) production in recombinant Escherichia coli. We integrated GadB from the hyperthermophilic, anaerobic archaeon Pyrococcus horikoshii to the C-terminus of the E. coli outer membrane protein C (OmpC). After 12 hr of culturing GadB-displaying cells, the GABA concentration in the extracellular medium increased to 3.2 g/l, which is eight times that obtained with cells expressing GadB in the cytosol. To further enhance GABA production, we increased the temperatures of the culture. At 60°C, the obtained GABA concentration was 4.62 g/l after 12 hr of culture, and 5.35 g/l after 24 hr, which corresponds to a yield of 87.7%.	0
Title: Cacaoidin, First Member of the New Lanthidin RiPP Family Abstract: Lantibiotics are ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides (RiPPs) characterized by the presence of lanthionine or methyllanthionine rings and their antimicrobial activity. Cacaoidin, a novel glycosylated lantibiotic, was isolated from a Streptomyces cacaoi strain and fully characterized by NMR, mass spectrometry, chemical derivatization approaches and genome analysis. The new molecule combines outstanding structural features, such as a high number of d-amino acids, an uncommon glycosylated tyrosine residue and an unprecedented N,N-dimethyl lanthionine. This latter feature places cacaoidin within a new RiPP family located between lanthipeptides and linaridins, here termed lanthidins. Cacaoidin displayed potent antibacterial activity against Gram-positive pathogens including Clostridium difficile. The biosynthetic gene cluster showed low homology with those of other known lanthipeptides or linaridins, suggesting a new RiPP biosynthetic pathway.	1
Title: Subtilomycin: a new lantibiotic from Bacillus subtilis strain MMA7 isolated from the marine sponge Haliclona simulans Abstract: Bacteriocins are attracting increased attention as an alternative to classic antibiotics in the fight against infectious disease and multidrug resistant pathogens. Bacillus subtilis strain MMA7 isolated from the marine sponge Haliclona simulans displays a broad spectrum antimicrobial activity, which includes Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens, as well as several pathogenic Candida species. This activity is in part associated with a newly identified lantibiotic, herein named as subtilomycin. The proposed biosynthetic cluster is composed of six genes, including protein-coding genes for LanB-like dehydratase and LanC-like cyclase modification enzymes, characteristic of the class I lantibiotics. The subtilomycin biosynthetic cluster in B. subtilis strain MMA7 is found in place of the sporulation killing factor (skf) operon, reported in many B. subtilis isolates and involved in a bacterial cannibalistic behaviour intended to delay sporulation. The presence of the subtilomycin biosynthetic cluster appears to be widespread amongst B. subtilis strains isolated from different shallow and deep water marine sponges. Subtilomycin possesses several desirable industrial and pharmaceutical physicochemical properties, including activity over a wide pH range, thermal resistance and water solubility. Additionally, the production of the lantibiotic subtilomycin could be a desirable property should B. subtilis strain MMA7 be employed as a probiotic in aquaculture applications.	1
Title: Fluorous supported modular synthesis of heparan sulfate oligosaccharides Abstract: The modular synthesis of heparan sulfate fragments is greatly facilitated by employing an anomeric aminopentyl linker protected by a benzyloxycarbonyl group modified by a perfluorodecyl tag, which made it possible to purify highly polar intermediates by fluorous solid phase extraction. This tagging methodology made it also possible to perform repeated glycosylations to drive reactions to completion.	0
Title: Mutational analysis of the group A streptococcal operon encoding streptolysin S and its virulence role in invasive infection Abstract: The pathogen group A Streptococcus (GAS) produces a wide spectrum of infections including necrotizing fasciitis (NF). Streptolysin S (SLS) produces the hallmark beta-haemolytic phenotype produced by GAS. The nine-gene GAS locus (sagA-sagI) resembling a bacteriocin biosynthetic operon is necessary and sufficient for SLS production. Using precise, in-frame allelic exchange mutagenesis and single-gene complementation, we show sagA, sagB, sagC, sagD, sagE, sagF and sagG are each individually required for SLS production, and that sagE may further serve an immunity function. Limited site-directed mutagenesis of specific amino acids in the SagA prepropeptide supports the designation of SLS as a bacteriocin-like toxin. No significant pleotrophic effects of sagA deletion were observed on M protein, capsule or cysteine protease production. In a murine model of NF, the SLS-negative M1T1 GAS mutant was markedly diminished in its ability to produce necrotic skin ulcers and spread to the systemic circulation. The SLS toxin impaired phagocytic clearance and promoted epithelial cell cytotoxicity, the latter phenotype being enhanced by the effects of M protein and streptolysin O. We conclude that all genetic components of the sag operon are required for expression of functional SLS, an important virulence factor in the pathogenesis of invasive M1T1 GAS infection.	1
Title: Streamlined syntheses of (-)-dictyostatin, 16-desmethyl-25,26-dihydrodictyostatin, and 6-epi-16-desmethyl-25,26-dihydrodictyostatin Abstract: The dictyostatins are a promising class of potential anti-cancer drugs because they are powerful microtubule-stabilizing agents, but the complexity of their chemical structures is a severe impediment to their further development. On the basis of both synthetic and medicinal chemistry analyses, 16-desmethyl-25,26-dihydrodictyostatin and its C6 epimer were chosen as potentially potent yet accessible dictyostatin analogues, and three new syntheses were developed. A relatively classical synthesis involving vinyllithium addition and macrocyclization gave way to a newer and more practical approach based on esterification and ring-closing metathesis reaction. Finally, aspects of these two approaches were combined to provide a third new synthesis based on esterification and Nozaki-Hiyama-Kishi reaction. This was used to prepare the target dihydro analogues and the natural product. All of the syntheses are streamlined because of their high convergency. The work provided several new analogues of dictyostatin, including a truncated macrolactone and a C10 E-alkene, which were 400- and 50-fold less active than (-)-dictyostatin, respectively. In contrast, the targeted 16-desmethyl-25,26-dihydrodictyostatin analogues retained almost complete activity in preliminary biological assays.	0
Title: Cloning of the gene cluster responsible for the biosynthesis of brasilicardin A, a unique diterpenoid Abstract: Brasilicardin A (BCA), produced by Nocardia brasiliensis IFM 0406 (currently referred to as N. terpenica), has a unique structure consisting of a diterpene skeleton with L-rhamnose, N-acetylglucosamine, amino acid, and 3-hydroxybenzoate moieties, and exhibits potent biological activities. To understand the biosynthetic machinery of this unique compound, we have cloned the corresponding gene cluster. Firstly, we cloned a gene by PCR that encodes geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase (GGPPS), which produces a direct precursor of diterpene compounds. We obtained four candidate genes and one of the genes was confirmed to encode a GGPPS. By sequence analysis of regions flanking the GGPPS gene, we identified eleven genes (bra1-11), all oriented in the same direction. We did not, however, detect any genes related to L-rhamnose and N-acetylglucosamine biosyntheses in the flanking regions. A gene disruption experiment did indeed show that this gene cluster was responsible for BCA biosynthesis.	1
Title: 2-Alkyl-4-hydroxymethylfuran-3-carboxylic acids, antibiotic production inducers discovered by Streptomyces coelicolor genome mining Abstract: All of the genetic elements necessary for the production of the antibiotic methylenomycin (Mm) and its regulation are contained within the 22-kb mmy-mmf gene cluster, which is located on the 356-kb linear plasmid SCP1 of Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2). A putative operon of 3 genes within this gene cluster, mmfLHP, was proposed to direct the biosynthesis of an A-factor-like signaling molecule, which could play a role in the regulation of Mm biosynthesis. The mmfLHP operon was expressed under the control of its native promoter in S. coelicolor M512, a host lacking the SCP1 plasmid, and the ability to produce prodiginine and actinorhodin antibiotics. Comparative metabolic profiling led to the identification and structure elucidation of a family of 5 new 2-alkyl-4-hydroxymethylfuran-3-carboxylic acids (AHFCAs), collectively termed Mm furans (MMFs), as the products of the mmfLHP genes. MMFs specifically induce the production of the Mm antibiotics in S. coelicolor. Comparative genomics analyses and searches of the natural product chemistry literature indicated that other streptomycetes may produce AHFCAs, suggesting that they could form a general class of antibiotic biosynthesis inducers in Streptomyces species, with analogous functions to the better known gamma-butyrolactone regulatory molecules.	1
Title: Type 1 capsule genes of Staphylococcus aureus are carried in a staphylococcal cassette chromosome genetic element Abstract: The cap1 genes are required for the synthesis of type 1 capsular polysaccharide (CP1) in Staphylococcus aureus. We previously showed that the cap1 locus was associated with a discrete genetic element in S. aureus M. In this report, we defined the boundaries of the cap1 element by comparing its restriction pattern to that of a corresponding region from the CP1-negative strain Becker. The element was located in the SmaI-G chromosomal fragment of the standard mapping strain NCTC8325. The sequences of the entire cap1 element and the flanking regions were determined. We found that there were two additional cap1 genes not previously identified. The cap1 operon was located in a staphylococcal cassette chromosome (SCC) element similar to the resistance island SCCmec recently described for methicillin resistance in S. aureus. Notably, the SCCcap1 element was located at the same insertion site as all the SCCmec elements in the staphylococcal chromosome. The excision of SCCcap1 could be demonstrated only in the presence of the recombinase genes from an SCCmec element, verifying that SCCcap1 is a genuine SCC element but defective in mobilization. A novel enterotoxin gene, whose transcript was detected by Northern blotting, was found next to the SCCcap1 locus. We propose that the enterotoxin gene and SCCcap1 were inserted into this locus at the juxtaposition by independent events. Sequence comparison revealed numerous DNA rearrangements and mutations in SCCcap1 and the left flanking region, suggesting that the SCCcap1 had been inserted at the SCC attC site a long time ago. In addition, most genes in this region were incomplete, with the exception of the 15 cap1 genes, implying that the cap1 genes confer a survival advantage on strain M.	1
Title: Dihydrofolate reductase of the extremely halophilic archaebacterium Halobacterium volcanii. The enzyme and its coding gene Abstract: Halobacterium volcanii mutants that are resistant to the dihydrofolate reductase inhibitor trimethoprim contain DNA sequence amplifications. This paper describes the cloning and nucleic acid sequencing of the amplified DNA sequence of the H. volcanii mutant WR215. This sequence contains an open reading frame that codes for an amino acid sequence that is homologous to the amino acid sequences of dihydrofolate reductases from different sources. As a result of the gene amplification, the trimethoprim-resistant mutant overproduces dihydrofolate reductase. This enzyme was purified to homogeneity using ammonium sulfate-mediated chromatographies. It is shown that the enzyme comprises 5% of the cell protein. The amino acid sequence of the first 15 amino acids of the enzyme fits the coding sequence of the gene. Preliminary biochemical characterization shows that the enzyme is unstable at salt concentrations lower than 2 M and that its activity increases with increase in the KCl or NaCl concentrations.	0
Title: Preparation of 1-acyloxyethyl esters of 7-[2-(2-aminothiazol-4-yl)acetamido]-3-[[[1-(2-dimethylaminoe thy l)-1H-tetrazol-5-yl]thio]-methyl]ceph-3-em-4-carboxylic acid (cefotiam) and their oral absorption in mice Abstract: In a separate study on the orally active acyloxymethyl esters (1) of 7-[2-(2-aminothiazol-4-yl)acetamido]-3-[[[1-(2-dimethylaminoethyl) - 1H-tetrazol-5-yl]thio]methyl]ceph-3-em-4-carboxylic acid (cefotiam, CTM), we have shown, by quantitative structure-oral bioavailability (BA) relation analysis, that the R2 group in the acyl group R2CO must have both an adequate lipophilicity (Hansch's lipophilic parameter, pi) and steric hindrance (Taft's Es value). However, to satisfy these requirements, a complex alkyl group R2 must be employed, the ester of which is difficult to synthesize and has unique metabolic fate. In this study, we selected and prepared the 1-acyloxyethyl esters (2) of CTM instead of 1 to avoid R2 groups that are too complicated. We found that the esters (2) gave improved oral BAs over 1: the 1-(3-methyl-valeryloxy)ethyl ester (2h) showed the highest peak plasma CTM level (Cmax) comparable to that obtained after subcutaneous injection of CTM. The 1-(cyclohexylacetoxy)ethyl ester (2t), the 1-(2-ethylbutyryloxy)ethyl ester (2j), and 2h showed BAs near 100%. For these esters (2), good correlations were also observed among the pi, the Es values of R2, and the log Cmax and log BA in the analysis of the quantitative structure-oral bioavailability relation: an ester having an alkyl group as R2 with a pi value of 3.07 or 3.08 and a Es value of -1.04 or -1.29 gave the highest Cmax or BA, respectively. As expected, the optimal pi values are almost the same as those obtained with 1 but the optimal Es values are larger (Es = -2.07). Thus, it has been confirmed by preparing 1-acyloxyethyl esters (2) of CTM that the oral bioavailability of CTM can further be improved without preparing acyloxymethyl esters (1) with a complicated acyl group.	0
Title: Genome mining of a prenylated and immunosuppressive polyketide from pathogenic fungi Abstract: Activation of the polycyclic polyketide prenyltransferase (pcPTase)-containing silent clusters in Aspergillus fumigatus and Neosartorya fischeri led to isolation of a new metabolite neosartoricin (3). The structure of 3 was solved by X-ray crystallography and NMR to be a prenylated anthracenone. 3 exhibits T-cell antiproliferative activity with an IC(50) of 3 μM, suggestive of a physiological role as an immunosuppressive agent.	1
Title: The identification of cutin synthase: formation of the plant polyester cutin Abstract: A hydrophobic cuticle consisting of waxes and the polyester cutin covers the aerial epidermis of all land plants, providing essential protection from desiccation and other stresses. We have determined the enzymatic basis of cutin polymerization through characterization of a tomato extracellular acyltransferase, CD1, and its substrate, 2-mono(10,16-dihydroxyhexadecanoyl)glycerol. CD1 has in vitro polyester synthesis activity and is required for cutin accumulation in vivo, indicating that it is a cutin synthase.	0
Title: In vitro and in vivo studies of three antibiotic combinations against gram-negative bacteria and Staphylococcus aureus Abstract: The activities of azlocillin, cefotaxime, and amikacin alone and in combination were evaluated in in vitro checkerboard studies, in infected neutropenic mice, and in human volunteers. The combination of cefotaxime plus amikacin was more synergistic in vitro than the others against the Enterobacteriaceae tested, and the combination of azlocillin plus amikacin was more synergistic against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. Survival of neutropenic mice infected with Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, respectively, was greater with azlocillin plus amikacin (24 of 40 and 11 of 40) and with cefotaxime plus amikacin (21 of 40 and 17 of 40) than with azlocillin plus cefotaxime (22 of 40 and 3 of 40; P less than 0.05). Median serum bactericidal activity in volunteers receiving these antibiotics alone and in combination was greater than or equal to 1:8 with most agents and with all combinations tested against 10 strains each of E. coli, K. pneumoniae, P. aeruginosa, and S. aureus. These data suggest that clinical trials with combinations of azlocillin or cefotaxime plus amikacin deserve further study in febrile neutropenic patients.	0
Title: Formal synthesis of (+/-)-platensimycin Abstract: [reaction: see text] Reductive alkylation of 5-methoxy-1-tetralone (6) with 2,3-dibromopropene gave an equilibrium mixture of bicyclic diones 7 (51%) and 8 (35%). Radical cyclization of 7 afforded tricyclic dione 5 (84%), which was reduced, cyclized, and dehydrated to give tetracyclic alkene 13 in 63% yield. Allylic oxidation of 13 with SeO2 and activated MnO2 afforded enone 2 in 85% yield, thereby completing a short formal synthesis of (+/-)-platensimycin.	0
Title: 2',3'-dideoxy-beta-L-5-fluorocytidine inhibits duck hepatitis B virus reverse transcription and suppresses viral DNA synthesis in hepatocytes, both in vitro and in vivo Abstract: beta-L-Nucleoside analogs represent a new class of potent antiviral agents with low cytotoxicity which provide new hope in the therapy of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infections. We evaluated the anti-HBV activity of 2',3'-dideoxy-beta-L-5-fluorocytidine (beta-L-F-ddC), a beta-L-nucleoside analog derived from 2',3'-dideoxycytidine (ddC), in the duck HBV (DHBV) model. This compound was previously shown to inhibit HBV DNA synthesis in a stably transfected hepatoma cell line (F2215). Using a cell-free system for the expression of an enzymatically active DHBV polymerase, we could demonstrate that the triphosphate form of beta-L-F-ddC does inhibit hepadnavirus reverse transcription. In primary duck hepatocyte culture, beta-L-F-ddC showed a potent inhibitory effect on DHBV DNA synthesis which was concentration dependent. Although beta-L-F-ddC was shown to be less active than ddC against the DHBV reverse transcriptase in vitro, beta-L-F-ddC was a stronger inhibitor in hepatocytes. The oral administration of beta-L-F-ddC in experimentally infected ducklings showed that beta-L-F-ddC is a potent inhibitor of viral replication in vivo. Short-term therapy could not prevent a rebound of viral replication after the drug was withdrawn. Preventive therapy with beta-L-F-ddC could delay the onset of viremia by only 1 day compared with the time to the onset of viremia in the control group. The in vivo inhibitory effect of beta-L-F-ddC was much stronger than that of ddC and was not associated with signs of toxicity. Our data show that beta-L-F-ddC inhibits hepadnavirus reverse transcription and is a strong inhibitor of viral replication both in vitro and in vivo.	0
Title: Novel avilamycin derivatives with improved polarity generated by targeted gene disruption Abstract: The oligosaccharide antibiotics avilamycin A and C are produced by Streptomyces viridochromogenes Tu57. Both consist of a heptasaccharide chain, which is attached to a polyketide-derived dichloroisoeverninic acid moiety. They show excellent antibiotic activity against Gram-positive bacteria. Both molecules are modified by O-methylation at different positions, which contributes to poor water solubility and difficulties in galenical drug development. In order to generate novel avilamycin derivatives with improved polarity and improved pharmacokinetic properties, we generated a series of mutants with one, two, or three mutated methyltransferase genes. Based on the structure of the novel avilamycin derivatives, the exact function of three methyltransferases, AviG2, AviG5, and AviG6, involved in avilamycin biosynthesis could be assigned.	1
Title: Unexpected Diversity and High Abundance of Putative Nitric Oxide Dismutase (Nod) Genes in Contaminated Aquifers and Wastewater Treatment Systems Abstract: It has recently been suggested that oxygenic dismutation of NO into N2 and O2 may occur in the anaerobic methanotrophic "Candidatus Methylomirabilis oxyfera" and the alkane-oxidizing gammaproteobacterium HdN1. It may represent a new pathway in microbial nitrogen cycling catalyzed by a putative NO dismutase (Nod). The formed O2 enables microbes to employ aerobic catabolic pathways in anoxic habitats, suggesting an ecophysiological niche space of substantial appeal for bioremediation and water treatment. However, it is still unknown whether this physiology is limited to "Ca Methylomirabilis oxyfera" and HdN1 and whether it can be coupled to the oxidation of electron donors other than alkanes. Here, we report insights into an unexpected diversity and remarkable abundance of nod genes in natural and engineered water systems. Phylogenetically diverse nod genes were recovered from a range of contaminated aquifers and N-removing wastewater treatment systems. Together with nod genes from "Ca Methylomirabilis oxyfera" and HdN1, the novel environmental nod sequences formed no fewer than 6 well-supported phylogenetic clusters, clearly distinct from canonical NO reductase (quinol-dependent NO reductase [qNor] and cytochrome c-dependent NO reductase [cNor]) genes. The abundance of nod genes in the investigated samples ranged from 1.6 × 107 to 5.2 × 1010 copies · g-1 (wet weight) of sediment or sludge biomass, accounting for up to 10% of total bacterial 16S rRNA gene counts. In essence, NO dismutation could be a much more widespread physiology than currently perceived. Understanding the controls of this emergent microbial capacity could offer new routes for nitrogen elimination or pollutant remediation in natural and engineered water systems.                  Importance:                       NO dismutation into N2 and O2 is a novel process catalyzed by putative NO dismutase (Nod). To date, only two bacteria, the anaerobic methane-oxidizing bacterium "Ca Methylomirabilis oxyfera" and the alkane-oxidizing gammaproteobacterium HdN1, are known to harbor nod genes. In this study, we report efficient molecular tools that can detect and quantify a wide diversity of nod genes in environmental samples. A surprisingly high diversity and abundance of nod genes were found in contaminated aquifers as well as wastewater treatment systems. This evidence indicates that NO dismutation may be a much more widespread physiology in natural and man-made environments than currently perceived. The molecular tools presented here will facilitate further studies on these enigmatic microbes in the future.	0
Title: Genome-scale analysis of the genes that contribute to Burkholderia pseudomallei biofilm formation identifies a crucial exopolysaccharide biosynthesis gene cluster Abstract: Burkholderia pseudomallei, the causative agent of melioidosis, is an important public health threat due to limited therapeutic options for treatment. Efforts to improve therapeutics for B. pseudomallei infections are dependent on the need to understand the role of B. pseudomallei biofilm formation and its contribution to antibiotic tolerance and persistence as these are bacterial traits that prevent effective therapy. In order to reveal the genes that regulate and/or contribute to B. pseudomallei 1026b biofilm formation, we screened a sequence defined two-allele transposon library and identified 118 transposon insertion mutants that were deficient in biofilm formation. These mutants include transposon insertions in genes predicted to encode flagella, fimbriae, transcriptional regulators, polysaccharides, and hypothetical proteins. Polysaccharides are key constituents of biofilms and B. pseudomallei has the capacity to produce a diversity of polysaccharides, thus there is a critical need to link these biosynthetic genes with the polysaccharides they produce to better understand their biological role during infection. An allelic exchange deletion mutant of the entire B. pseudomallei biofilm-associated exopolysaccharide biosynthetic cluster was decreased in biofilm formation and produced a smooth colony morphology suggestive of the loss of exopolysaccharide production. Conversely, deletion of the previously defined capsule I polysaccharide biosynthesis gene cluster increased biofilm formation. Bioinformatics analyses combined with immunoblot analysis and glycosyl composition studies of the partially purified exopolysaccharide indicate that the biofilm-associated exopolysaccharide is neither cepacian nor the previously described acidic exopolysaccharide. The biofilm-associated exopolysaccharide described here is also specific to the B. pseudomallei complex of bacteria. Since this novel exopolysaccharide biosynthesis cluster is retained in B. mallei, it is predicted to have a role in colonization and infection of the host. These findings will facilitate further advances in understanding the pathogenesis of B. pseudomallei and improve diagnostics and therapeutic treatment strategies.	1
Title: Discovery of potent and selective covalent inhibitors of JNK Abstract: The mitogen-activated kinases JNK1/2/3 are key enzymes in signaling modules that transduce and integrate extracellular stimuli into coordinated cellular response. Here, we report the discovery of irreversible inhibitors of JNK1/2/3. We describe two JNK3 cocrystal structures at 2.60 and 2.97 Å resolution that show the compounds form covalent bonds with a conserved cysteine residue. JNK-IN-8 is a selective JNK inhibitor that inhibits phosphorylation of c-Jun, a direct substrate of JNK, in cells exposed to submicromolar drug in a manner that depends on covalent modification of the conserved cysteine residue. Extensive biochemical, cellular, and pathway-based profiling establish the selectivity of JNK-IN-8 for JNK and suggests that the compound will be broadly useful as a pharmacological probe of JNK-dependent signal transduction. Potential lead compounds have also been identified for kinases, including IRAK1, PIK3C3, PIP4K2C, and PIP5K3.	0
Title: Tandem Bioorthogonal Labeling Uncovers Endogenous Cotranslationally O-GlcNAc Modified Nascent Proteins Abstract: Hundreds of nuclear, cytoplasmic, and mitochondrial proteins within multicellular eukaryotes have hydroxyl groups of specific serine and threonine residues modified by the monosaccharide N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc). This modification, known as O-GlcNAc, has emerged as a central regulator of both cell physiology and human health. A key emerging function of O-GlcNAc appears to be to regulate cellular protein homeostasis. We previously showed, using overexpressed model proteins, that O-GlcNAc modification can occur cotranslationally and that this process prevents premature degradation of such nascent polypeptide chains. Here, we use tandem metabolic engineering strategies to label endogenously occurring nascent polypeptide chains within cells using O-propargyl-puromycin (OPP) and target the specific subset of nascent chains that are cotranslationally glycosylated with O-GlcNAc by metabolic saccharide engineering using tetra-O-acetyl-2-N-azidoacetyl-2-deoxy-d-galactopyranose (Ac4GalNAz). Using various combinations of sequential chemoselective ligation strategies, we go on to tag these analytes with a series of labels, allowing us to define conditions that enable their robust labeling. Two-step enrichment of these glycosylated nascent chains, combined with shotgun proteomics, allows us to identify a set of endogenous cotranslationally O-GlcNAc modified proteins. Using alternative targeted methods, we examine three of these identified proteins and further validate their cotranslational O-GlcNAcylation. These findings detail strategies to enable isolation and identification of extremely low abundance endogenous analytes present within complex protein mixtures. Moreover, this work opens the way to studies directed at understanding the roles of O-GlcNAc and other cotranslational protein modifications and should stimulate an improved understanding of the role of O-GlcNAc in cytoplasmic protein quality control and proteostasis.	0
Title: Physiologically Based Pharmacokinetic Model of Rifapentine and 25-Desacetyl Rifapentine Disposition in Humans Abstract: Rifapentine (RPT) is a rifamycin antimycobacterial and, as part of a combination therapy, is indicated for the treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis Although the results from a number of studies indicate that rifapentine has the potential to shorten treatment duration and enhance completion rates compared to other rifamycin agents utilized in antituberculosis drug regimens (i.e., regimens 1 to 4), its optimal dose and exposure in humans are unknown. To help inform such an optimization, a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model was developed to predict time course, tissue-specific concentrations of RPT and its active metabolite, 25-desacetyl rifapentine (dRPT), in humans after specified administration schedules for RPT. Starting with the development and verification of a PBPK model for rats, the model was extrapolated and then tested using human pharmacokinetic data. Testing and verification of the models included comparisons of predictions to experimental data in several rat tissues and time course RPT and dRPT plasma concentrations in humans from several single- and repeated-dosing studies. Finally, the model was used to predict RPT concentrations in the lung during the intensive and continuation phases of a current recommended TB treatment regimen. Based on these results, it is anticipated that the PBPK model developed in this study will be useful in evaluating dosing regimens for RPT and for characterizing tissue-level doses that could be predictors of problems related to efficacy or safety.	0
Title: Oxidative cleavage of premithramycin B is one of the last steps in the biosynthesis of the antitumor drug mithramycin Abstract: Background:                       Mithramycin is a member of the clinically important aureolic acid group of antitumor drugs that interact with GC-rich regions of DNA nonintercalatively. These drugs contain a chromophore aglycon that is derived from condensation of ten acetate units (catalyzed by a type II polyketide synthase). The aglycones are glycosylated at two positions with different chain length deoxyoligosaccharides, which are essential for the antitumor activity. During the early stages of mithramycin biosynthesis, tetracyclic intermediates of the tetracycline-type occur, which must be converted at later stages into the tricyclic glycosylated molecule, presumably through oxidative breakage of the fourth ring.                  Results:                       Two intermediates in the mithramycin biosynthetic pathway, 4-demethyl-premithramycinone and premithramycin B, were identified in a mutant lacking the mithramycin glycosyltransferase and methyltransferase genes and in the same mutant complemented with the deleted genes, respectively. Premithramycin B contains five deoxysugars moieties (like mithramycin), but contains a tetracyclic aglycon moiety instead of a tricyclic aglycon. We hypothesized that transcription of mtmOIV (encoding an oxygenase) was impaired in this strain, preventing oxidative breakage of the fourth ring of premithramycin B. Inactivating mtmOIV generated a mithramycin nonproducing mutant that accumulated premithramycin B instead of mithramycin. In vitro assays demonstrated that MtmOIV converted premithramycin B into a tricyclic compound.                  Conclusions:                       In the late stages of mithramycin biosynthesis by Strepyomyces argillaceus, a fully glycosylated tetracyclic tetracycline-like intermediate (premithramycin B) is converted into a tricyclic compound by the oxygenase MtmOIV. This oxygenase inserts an oxygen (Baeyer-Villiger oxidation) and opens the resulting lactone. The following decarboxylation and ketoreduction steps lead to mithramycin. Opening of the fourth ring represents one of the last steps in mithramycin biosynthesis.	1
Title: Computational models for large-scale simulations of facilitated diffusion Abstract: The binding of site-specific transcription factors to their genomic target sites is a key step in gene regulation. While the genome is huge, transcription factors belong to the least abundant protein classes in the cell. It is therefore fascinating how short the time frame is that they require to home in on their target sites. The underlying search mechanism is called facilitated diffusion and assumes a combination of three-dimensional diffusion in the space around the DNA combined with one-dimensional random walk on it. In this review, we present the current understanding of the facilitated diffusion mechanism and identify questions that lack a clear or detailed answer. One way to investigate these questions is through stochastic simulation and, in this manuscript, we support the idea that such simulations are able to address them. Finally, we review which biological parameters need to be included in such computational models in order to obtain a detailed representation of the actual process.	0
Title: Nucleotide sequence analysis of the Leptospira biflexa serovar patoc rpsL and rpsG genes Abstract: The Leptospira biflexa rpsL and rpsG genes were sequenced. Although similar in many respects, proteins encoded by these L. biflexa genes had several unusual features when compared with homologous proteins of other organisms. Unlike the rpsL genes of other eubacteria, the L. biflexa rpsL gene is adjacent to a rpoC-like gene.	0
Title: Enzymatic Formation of Rufoschweinitzin, a Binaphthalene from the Basidiomycete Cortinarius rufoolivaceus Abstract: Dimeric polyketides are widespread fungal secondary metabolites. They occur in both ascomycetes and basidiomycetes and, therefore, across fungal phyla. Here we report the isolation of a new binaphthalene, named rufoschweinitzin, from the basidiomycete Cortinarius rufoolivaceus. Rufoschweinitzin consists of two symmetrically 4,4'-coupled torachrysone-8-O-methyl ether moieties. Furthermore, we have identified a binaphthalene biosynthetic gene cluster in an unrelated fungus, the ascomycete Xylaria schweinitzii. Heterologous expression of the encoded cytochrome P450 enzyme verified its coupling activity: dimerization of torachrysone-8-O-methyl ether led to the formation of rufoschweinitzin alongside a hitherto unknown regioisomer, now named alloschweinitzin. We have thus demonstrated enzymatic formation of the basidiomycete's metabolite rufoschweinitzin and made the regiochemistry of alloschweinitzin accessible with an ascomycete-derived enzyme.	1
Title: X-ray diffraction "fingerprinting" of DNA structure in solution for quantitative evaluation of molecular dynamics simulation Abstract: Solution state x-ray diffraction fingerprinting is demonstrated as a method for experimentally assessing the accuracy of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Fourier transforms of coordinate data from MD simulations are used to produce reciprocal space "fingerprints" of atomic pair distance correlations that are characteristic of the ensemble and are the direct numerical analogues of experimental solution x-ray diffraction (SXD). SXD experiments and MD simulations were carried out to test the ability of experiment and simulation to resolve sequence-dependent modifications in helix conformation for B-form DNA. SXD experiments demonstrated that solution-state poly(AT) and poly(A)-poly(T) duplex DNA sequences exist in ensembles close to canonical B-form and B'-form structures, respectively. In contrast, MD simulations analyzed in terms of SXD fingerprints are shown to deviate from experiment, most significantly for poly(A)-poly(T) duplex DNA. Compared with experiment, MD simulation shortcomings were found to include both mismatches in simulated conformer structures and number population within the ensembles. This work demonstrates an experimental approach for quantitatively evaluating MD simulations and other coordinate models to simulate biopolymer structure in solution and suggests opportunities to use solution diffraction data as experimental benchmarks for developing supramolecular force fields optimized for a range of in situ applications.	0
Title: Chrysogine Biosynthesis Is Mediated by a Two-Module Nonribosomal Peptide Synthetase Abstract: Production of chrysogine has been reported from several fungal genera including Penicillium, Aspergillus, and Fusarium. Anthranilic acid and pyruvic acid, which are expected precursors of chrysogine, enhance production of this compound. A possible route for the biosynthesis using these substrates is via a nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS). Through comparative analysis of the NRPSs from genome-sequenced producers of chrysogine we identified a candidate NRPS cluster comprising five additional genes named chry2-6. Deletion of the two-module NRPS (NRPS14 = chry1) abolished chrysogine production in Fusarium graminearum, indicating that the gene cluster is responsible for chrysogine biosynthesis. Overexpression of NRPS14 enhanced chrysogine production, suggesting that the NRPS is the bottleneck in the biosynthetic pathway.	1
Title: Genomics-Guided Exploitation of Lipopeptide Diversity in Myxobacteria Abstract: Analysis of 122 myxobacterial genome sequences suggested 16 strains as producers of the myxochromide lipopeptide family. Detailed sequence comparison of the respective mch biosynthetic gene clusters informed a genome-mining approach, ultimately leading to the discovery and chemical characterization of four novel myxochromide core types. The myxochromide megasynthetase is subject to evolutionary diversification, resulting in considerable structural diversity of biosynthesis products. The observed differences are due to the number, type, sequence, and configuration of the incorporated amino acids. The analysis revealed molecular details on how point mutations and recombination events led to structural diversity. It also gave insights into the evolutionary scenarios that have led to the emergence of mch clusters in different strains and genera of myxobacteria.	1
Title: Efficient biosynthesis of heterodimeric C3-aryl pyrroloindoline alkaloids Abstract: Many natural products contain the hexahydropyrrolo[2, 3-b]indole (HPI) framework. HPI containing chemicals exhibit various biological activities and distinguishable structural arrangement. This structural complexity renders chemical synthesis very challenging. Here, through investigating the biosynthesis of a naturally occurring C3-aryl HPI, naseseazine C (NAS-C), we identify a P450 enzyme (NascB) and reveal that NascB catalyzes a radical cascade reaction to form intramolecular and intermolecular carbon-carbon bonds with both regio- and stereo-specificity. Surprisingly, the limited freedom is allowed in specificity to generate four types of C3-aryl HPI scaffolds, and two of them were not previously observed. By incorporating NascB into an engineered strain of E. coli, we develop a whole-cell biocatalysis system for efficient production of NAS-C and 30 NAS analogs. Interestingly, we find that some of these analogs exhibit potent neuroprotective properties. Thus, our biocatalytic methodology offers an efficient and simple route to generate difficult HPI framework containing chemicals.	1
Title: Engineering unnatural variants of plantazolicin through codon reprogramming Abstract: Plantazolicin (PZN) is a polyheterocyclic natural product derived from a ribosomal peptide that harbors remarkable antibiotic selectivity for the causative agent of anthrax, Bacillus anthracis. To simultaneously establish the structure-activity relationship of PZN and the substrate tolerance of the biosynthetic pathway, an Escherichia coli expression strain was engineered to heterologously produce PZN analogues. Variant PZN precursor genes were produced by site-directed mutagenesis and later screened by mass spectrometry to assess post-translational modification and export by E. coli. From a screen of 72 precursor peptides, 29 PZN variants were detected. This analogue collection provided insight into the selectivity of the post-translational modifying enzymes and established the boundaries of the natural biosynthetic pathway. Unlike other studied thiazole/oxazole-modified microcins, the biosynthetic machinery appeared to be finely tuned toward the production of PZN, such that the cognate enzymes did not process even other naturally occurring sequences from similar biosynthetic clusters. The modifying enzymes were exquisitely selective, installing heterocycles only at predefined positions within the precursor peptides while leaving neighboring residues unmodified. Nearly all substitutions at positions normally harboring heterocycles prevented maturation of a PZN variant, though some exceptions were successfully produced lacking a heterocycle at the penultimate residue. No variants containing additional heterocycles were detected, although several peptide sequences yielded multiple PZN variants as a result of varying oxidation states of select residues. Eleven PZN variants were produced in sufficient quantity to facilitate purification and assessment of their antibacterial activity, providing insight into the structure-activity relationship of PZN.	1
Title: The human splicing factor ASF/SF2 can specifically recognize pre-mRNA 5' splice sites Abstract: ASF/SF2 is a human protein previously shown to function in in vitro pre-mRNA splicing as an essential factor necessary for all splices and also as an alternative splicing factor, capable of switching selection of 5' splice sites. To begin to study the protein's mechanism of action, we have investigated the RNA binding properties of purified recombinant ASF/SF2. Using UV crosslinking and gel shift assays, we demonstrate that the RNA binding region of ASF/SF2 can interact with RNA in a sequence-specific manner, recognizing the 5' splice site in each of two different pre-mRNAs. Point mutations in the 5' splice site consensus can reduce binding by as much as a factor of 100, with the largest effects observed in competition assays. These findings support a model in which ASF/SF2 aids in the recognition of pre-mRNA 5' splice sites.	0
Title: Iteration as programmed event during polyketide assembly; molecular analysis of the aureothin biosynthesis gene cluster Abstract: Analysis of the type I modular polyketide synthase (PKS) involved in the biosynthesis of the rare nitroaryl polyketide metabolite aureothin (aur) from Streptomyces thioluteus HKI-227 has revealed only four modules to catalyze the five polyketide chain extensions required. By heterologous expression of the aur PKS cluster, direct evidence was obtained that these modules were sufficient to support aureothin biosynthesis. It appears that one module catalyzes two successive cycles of chain extension, one of the first examples of a PKS in which such iteration or "stuttering" is required to produce the normal polyketide product. In addition, lack of a specified loading domain implicates a novel PKS priming mechanism involving the unique p-nitrobenzoate starter unit. The 27 kb aur gene cluster also encodes a novel N-oxidase, which may represent the first member of a new family of such enzymes.	1
Title: Nitrogen fixation (acetylene reduction) associated with duckweed (lemnaceae) mats Abstract: Duckweed (Lemnaceae) mats in Texas and Florida were investigated, using the acetylene reduction assay, to determine whether nitrogen fixation occurred in these floating aquatic macrophyte communities. N(2)-fixing microorganisms were enumerated by plating or most-probable-number techniques, using appropriate N-free media. Results of the investigations indicated that substantial N(2)-fixation (C(2)H(2)) was associated with duckweed mats in Texas and Florida. Acetylene reduction values ranged from 1 to 18 mumol of C(2)H(4) g (dry weight) day for samples incubated aerobically in light. Dark N(2) fixation was always two- to fivefold lower. 3-(3,4-Dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (7 to 10 muM) reduced acetylene reduction to levels intermediate between light and dark incubation. Acetylene reduction was generally greatest for samples incubated anaerobically in the light. It was estimated that 15 to 20% of the N requirement of the duckweed could be supplied through biological nitrogen fixation. N(2)-fixing heterotrophic bacteria (10 cells g [wet weight] and cyanobacteria (10 propagules g [wet weight] were associated with the duckweed mats. Azotobacter sp. was not detected in these investigations. One diazotrophic isolate was classified as Klebsiella.	0
Title: Discovery of a novel analogue of FR901533 and the corresponding biosynthetic gene cluster from Streptosporangium roseum No. 79089 Abstract: FR901533 (1, also known as WS79089B), WS79089A (2), and WS79089C (3) are polycyclic aromatic natural products with promising inhibitory activity to endothelin-converting enzymes. In this work, we isolated five tridecaketide products from Streptosporangium roseum No. 79089, including 1-3, benaphthamycin (4) and a novel FR901533 analogue (5). The structure of 5 was characterized based on spectroscopic data. Compared with the major product 2, the new compound 5 has an additional hydroxyl group at C-12 and an extra methyl group at the 13-OH. The configuration of C-19 of these compounds was determined to be R using Mosher's method. A putative biosynthetic gene cluster for compounds 1-5 was discovered by analyzing the genome of S. roseum No. 79089. This 38.6-kb gene cluster contains 38 open reading frames, including a minimal polyketide synthase (wsaA-C), an aromatase (wsaD), three cyclases (wsaE, F, and W), and a series of tailoring enzymes such as monooxygenases (wsaO1-O7) and methyltransferases (wsaM1 and M2). Disruption of the ketosynthase gene (wsaA) in this gene cluster abolished the production of 1-5, confirming that this gene cluster is indeed responsible for the biosynthesis of 1-5. A type II polyketide biosynthetic pathway was proposed for this group of natural endothelin-converting enzyme inhibitors. KEY POINTS: • Five aromatic tridecaketides were isolated from Streptosporangium roseum No. 79089. • A novel FR901533 analogue, 12-hydroxy-13-O-methyl-WS79089A, was characterized. • The absolute configuration of C-19 of FR901533 and analogues was determined. • The biosynthetic gene cluster of FR901533 and analogues was discovered.	1
Title: Molecular cloning and functional characterization of two CYP619 cytochrome P450s involved in biosynthesis of patulin in Aspergillus clavatus Abstract: Patulin is an acetate-derived tetraketide mycotoxin produced by several fungal species, especially Aspergillus, Penicillium and Byssochlamys species. The health risks due to patulin consumption by humans have led many countries to regulate it in human food. Previous studies have shown the involvement of cytochrome P450 monooxygenases in the hydroxylation of two precursors of patulin, m-cresol and m-hydroxybenzylalcohol. In the present study, two cytochrome P450 genes were identified in the genome sequence of Aspergillus clavatus, a patulin-producing species. Both mRNAs were strongly co-expressed during patulin production. CYP619C2, encoded by the first gene, consists of 529 aa, while the second cytochrome, CYP619C3, consists of 524 aa. The coding sequences were used to perform the heterologous expression of functional enzymes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The bioconversion assays showed that CYP619C3 catalysed the hydroxylation of m-cresol to yield m-hydroxybenzyl alcohol. CYP619C2 catalysed the hydroxylation of m-hydroxybenzyl alcohol and m-cresol to gentisyl alcohol and 2,5-dihydroxytoluene (toluquinol), respectively. Except for the last compound, all enzyme products are known precursors of patulin. Taken together, these data strongly suggest the involvement of CYP619C2 and CYP619C3 in the biosynthesis of patulin. CYP619C2 and CYP619C3 are located near to two other genes involved in patulin biosynthesis, namely the 6-methylsalicylic acid synthase (6msas) and isoepoxydon dehydrogenase (idh) genes. The current data associated with an analysis of the sequence of A. clavatus suggest the presence of a cluster of 15 genes involved in patulin biosynthesis.	1
Title: Structures of darunavir-resistant HIV-1 protease mutant reveal atypical binding of darunavir to wide open flaps Abstract: The molecular basis for high resistance to clinical inhibitors of HIV-1 protease (PR) was examined for the variant designated PRP51 that was selected for resistance to darunavir (DRV). High resolution crystal structures of PRP51 with the active site D25N mutation revealed a ligand-free form and an inhibitor-bound form showing a unique binding site and orientation for DRV. This inactivating mutation is known to increase the dimer dissociation constant and decrease DRV affinity of PR. The PRP51-D25N dimers were in the open conformation with widely separated flaps, as reported for other highly resistant variants. PRP51-D25N dimer bound two DRV molecules and showed larger separation of 8.7 Å between the closest atoms of the two flaps compared with 4.4 Å for the ligand-free structure of this mutant. The ligand-free structure, however, lacked van der Waals contacts between Ile50 and Pro81' from the other subunit in the dimer, unlike the majority of PR structures. DRV is bound inside the active site cavity; however, the inhibitor is oriented almost perpendicular to its typical position and exhibits only 2 direct hydrogen bond and two water-mediated interactions with atoms of PRP51-D25N compared with 11 hydrogen bond interactions seen for DRV bound in the typical position in wild-type enzyme. The atypical location of DRV may provide opportunities for design of novel inhibitors targeting the open conformation of PR drug-resistant mutants.	0
Title: Paenimacrolidin, a novel macrolide antibiotic from Paenibacillus sp. F6-B70 active against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus Abstract: Paenibacillus sp. F6-B70 was selected from several dozens of isolates with activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus using a 16S rDNA-based screening method. F6-B70 contained polyketide synthase (PKS) and non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) clusters in its genome revealed by PCR amplification of conserved adenylation and ketosynthase (KS) domains. Phylogenetic data suggested that the strain hosts trans-AT PKSs and their product may be a branched molecule. An antibiotic was subsequently isolated from the methanol extract of F6-B70 cells. The molecular formula of the antibiotic was deduced to be C(33) H(50) NaO(6) ([M + Na](+) , m/z 565.3505) by analysis of electrospray ionization mass spectral data. Elucidation of the structure by nuclear magnetic resonance and infrared spectroscopy revealed that the active compound, paenimacrolidin (PAM), was a novel 22-membered macrolide with side-chains. The new antibiotic, mainly as a bacteriostatic agent, inhibits a couple of multidrug-resistant Staphylococcus sp. strains. The antibiotic capacity of PAM was compromised by its instability, which can be overcome significantly with addition of an anti-oxidant. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the isolation of an active macrolide from paenibacilli, which may be a promising source of novel antibiotics.	1
Title: A one-pot chemoenzymatic synthesis for the universal precursor of antidiabetes and antiviral bis-indolylquinones Abstract: Bis-indolylquinones represent a class of fungal natural products that display antiretroviral, antidiabetes, or cytotoxic bioactivities. Recent advances in Aspergillus genomic mining efforts have led to the discovery of the tdiA-E-gene cluster, which is the first genetic locus dedicated to bis-indolylquinone biosynthesis. We have now genetically and biochemically characterized the enzymes TdiA (bis-indolylquinone synthetase) and TdiD (L-tryptophan:phenylpyruvate aminotransferase), which, together, confer biosynthetic abilities for didemethylasterriquinone D to Aspergillus nidulans. This compound is the universal intermediate for all bis-indolylquinones. In this biochemical study of a bis-indolylquinone synthetase and a fungal natural product transaminase, we present a one-pot chemoenzymatic protocol to generate didemethylasterriquinone D in vitro. As TdiA resembles a nonribosomal peptide synthetase, yet catalyzes carbon-carbon-bond formation, we discuss the implications for peptide synthetase chemistry.	1
Title: Microneedle-Assisted Percutaneous Delivery of a Tetramethylpyrazine-Loaded Microemulsion Abstract: This study examined the efficacy of the percutaneous delivery of a tetramethylpyrazine-loaded microemulsion (TMP-ME) on skin pretreated with microneedles (MN). The TMP-ME formulation was optimized in vitro with skin permeation experiments, using a uniform experimental design, guided by a pseudo-ternary phase diagram, in which the TMP skin permeation level and mean particle size were indices. The effects of MN pretreatment on skin permeation by TMP-ME were assessed using in vitro skin permeation, in vivo skin microdialysis, and pharmacokinetic studies in rats. The influence of MN pretreatment on the skin barrier function was evaluated by measuring the electrical resistance of rat skin before and after MN insertion. In the optimal formulation of TMP-ME, the weight percentages of Maisine® 35-1 (oil phase), Labrasol® (surfactant), and Transcutol® P (co-surfactant) were 7%, 30% and 10%, respectively, with 1.5% TMP loading. In the in vitro skin permeation study, MN-assisted TMP-ME exhibited a two-fold increase in a 24-h cumulative TMP permeation compared with TMP-ME alone (p < 0.05). In the skin microdialysis study, TMP in MN-assisted TMP-ME exhibited a 1.25-fold increase in Cmax, a 0.93-fold decrease in Tmax, and a 0.88-fold increase in AUC0-t (p < 0.05). Similarly, in the pharmacokinetic study, TMP in MN-assisted TMP-ME exhibited a 2.11-fold increase in Cmax, a 0.67-fold decrease in Tmax, and a 1.07-fold increase in AUC0-t (p < 0.05). The percutaneous electrical resistance of rat skin before and after MN insertion was 850 ± 50 Ω/cm² and 283 ± 104 Ω/cm² respectively, indicating that MN dramatically compromises the skin barrier. These results suggest that MN assistance increases the skin permeation rate and the extent of percutaneous absorption of TMP-ME, and that the mechanism may involve the reversible barrier perturbation effect. The rate and extent of percutaneous absorption of TMP-ME can be significantly enhanced by MN assistance, possibly because MN causes a reversible barrier perturbation effect on skin.	0
Title: Otoancorin, an inner ear protein restricted to the interface between the apical surface of sensory epithelia and their overlying acellular gels, is defective in autosomal recessive deafness DFNB22 Abstract: A 3,673-bp murine cDNA predicted to encode a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored protein of 1,088 amino acids was isolated during a study aimed at identifying transcripts specifically expressed in the inner ear. This inner ear-specific protein, otoancorin, shares weak homology with megakaryocyte potentiating factor/mesothelin precursor. Otoancorin is located at the interface between the apical surface of the inner ear sensory epithelia and their overlying acellular gels. In the cochlea, otoancorin is detected at two attachment zones of the tectorial membrane, a permanent one along the top of the spiral limbus and a transient one on the surface of the developing greater epithelial ridge. In the vestibule, otoancorin is present on the apical surface of nonsensory cells, where they contact the otoconial membranes and cupulae. The identification of the mutation (IVS12+2T>C) in the corresponding gene OTOA in one consanguineous Palestinian family affected by nonsyndromic recessive deafness DFNB22 assigns an essential function to otoancorin. We propose that otoancorin ensures the attachment of the inner ear acellular gels to the apical surface of the underlying nonsensory cells.	0
Title: Improved production of A40926 by Nonomuraea sp. through deletion of a pathway-specific acetyltransferase Abstract: Nonomuraea strain ATCC 39727 produces the glycopeptide A40926, used for manufacturing dalbavancin, currently in advanced clinical trials. From the gene cluster involved in A40926 biosynthesis, a strain deleted in dbv23 was constructed. This mutant can produce only the glycopeptides lacking the O-linked acetyl residue at position 6 of the mannose moiety, while, under identical fermentation conditions, the wild-type strain produces mostly glycopeptides carrying an acetylated mannose. Furthermore, the total amount of glycopeptides produced by the mutant strain was found to be approximately twice that of the wild type. The reduced level of glycopeptides observed in the wild-type strain may be due to an inhibitory effect exerted by the acetylated compound on the biosynthesis of A40926. Indeed, spiking production cultures with > or =1 microg/ml of the acetylated glycopeptide inhibited A40926 production in the mutant strain.	1
Title: Heterologous production of fosfomycin and identification of the minimal biosynthetic gene cluster Abstract: Fosfomycin is a clinically utilized, highly effective antibiotic, which is active against methicillin- and vancomycin-resistant pathogens. Here we report the cloning and characterization of a complete fosfomycin biosynthetic cluster from Streptomyces fradiae and heterologous production of fosfomycin in S. lividans. Sequence analysis coupled with gene deletion and disruption revealed that the minimal cluster consists of fom1-4, fomA-D. A LuxR-type activator that was apparently required for heterologous fosfomycin production was also discovered approximately 13 kb away from the cluster and was named fomR. The genes fomE and fomF, previously thought to be involved in fosfomycin biosynthesis, were shown not to be essential by gene disruption. This work provides new insights into fosfomycin biosynthesis and opens the door for fosfomycin overproduction and creation of new analogs via biomolecular pathway engineering.	1
Title: Two-photon fluorescent polysiloxane-based films with thermally responsive self switching properties achieved by a unique reversible spirocyclization mechanism Abstract: Responsiveness and reversibility are present in nature, and are ubiquitous in biological systems. The realization of reversibility and responsiveness is of great importance in the development of properties and the design of new materials. However, two-photon fluorescent thermal-responsive materials have not been reported to date. Herein, we engineered thermally responsive polysiloxane materials (Dns-non) that exhibited unique two-photon luminescence, and this is the first report about thermally responsive luminescent materials with two-photon fluorescence. The fluorescence of Dns-non could switch from the "on" to "off" state through a facile heating and cooling process, which could be observed by the naked eye. Monitoring the temperature of the CPU in situ was achieved by easily coating D1-non onto the CPU surface, which verified the potential application in devices of Dns-non. A unique alkaline tuned reversible transition mechanism of rhodamine-B from its spirocyclic to its ring-open state was proposed. Furthermore, Dns-non appeared to be a useful cell adhesive for the culture of cells on the surface. We believe that the constructed thermally responsive silicon films which have promising utilization as a new type of functional fluorescent material, may show broad applications in materials chemistry or bioscience.	0
Title: Optical Electrophysiology: Toward the Goal of Label-Free Voltage Imaging Abstract: Measuring and monitoring the electrical signals transmitted between neurons is key to understanding the communication between neurons that underlies human perception, information processing, and decision-making. While electrode-based electrophysiology has been the gold standard, optical electrophysiology has opened up a new area in the past decade. Voltage-dependent fluorescent reporters enable voltage imaging with high spatial resolution and flexibility to choose recording locations. However, they exhibit photobleaching as well as phototoxicity and may perturb the physiology of the cell. Label-free optical electrophysiology seeks to overcome these hurdles by detecting electrical activities optically, without the incorporation of exogenous fluorophores in cells. For example, electrochromic optical recording detects neuroelectrical signals via a voltage-dependent color change of extracellular materials, and interferometric optical recording monitors membrane deformations that accompany electrical activities. Label-free optical electrophysiology, however, is in an early stage, and often has limited sensitivity and temporal resolution. In this Perspective, we review the recent progress to overcome these hurdles. We hope this Perspective will inspire developments of label-free optical electrophysiology techniques with high recording sensitivity and temporal resolution in the near future.	0
Title: Structural basis of transfer between lipoproteins by cholesteryl ester transfer protein Abstract: Human cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) mediates the net transfer of cholesteryl ester mass from atheroprotective high-density lipoproteins to atherogenic low-density lipoproteins by an unknown mechanism. Delineating this mechanism would be an important step toward the rational design of new CETP inhibitors for treating cardiovascular diseases. Using EM, single-particle image processing and molecular dynamics simulation, we discovered that CETP bridges a ternary complex with its N-terminal β-barrel domain penetrating into high-density lipoproteins and its C-terminal domain interacting with low-density lipoprotein or very-low-density lipoprotein. In our mechanistic model, the CETP lipoprotein-interacting regions, which are highly mobile, form pores that connect to a hydrophobic central cavity, thereby forming a tunnel for transfer of neutral lipids from donor to acceptor lipoproteins. These new insights into CETP transfer provide a molecular basis for analyzing mechanisms for CETP inhibition.	0
Title: bryA: an unusual modular polyketide synthase gene from the uncultivated bacterial symbiont of the marine bryozoan Bugula neritina Abstract: "Candidatus Endobugula sertula," the uncultivated bacterial symbiont of Bugula neritina, is the proposed source of the bryostatin family of anticancer compounds. We cloned a large modular polyketide synthase (PKS) gene complex from "Candidatus Endobugula sertula" and characterized one gene, bryA, which we propose is responsible for the initial steps of bryostatin biosynthesis. Typical PKS domains are present. However, acyltransferase domains are lacking in bryA, and beta-ketoacyl synthase domains of bryA cluster with those of PKSs with discrete, rather than integral, acyltransferases. We propose a model for biosynthesis of the bryostatin D-lactate starter unit by the bryA loading module, utilizing atypical domains homologous to FkbH, KR, and DH. The bryA gene product is proposed to synthesize a portion of the pharmacologically active part of bryostatin and may be useful in semisynthesis of clinically useful bryostatin analogs.	1
Title: The length of the bound fatty acid influences the dynamics of the acyl carrier protein and the stability of the thioester bond Abstract: Acyl carrier proteins involved in fatty acid biosynthesis have been shown to exhibit a high degree of conformational flexibility, in that they are able to sequester fatty acid intermediates between 4 and 18 carbons in length. This flexibility has been observed in X-ray and NMR structures of acyl carrier proteins attached to different fatty acids. NMR studies comparing decanoyl-ACP and stearoyl-ACP indicated that ACP exhibits more dynamic motions when bound to longer fatty acids. We have used complementary chemical and NMR methods as an approach to improving our understanding of the effect of fatty acid length on the dynamics of acyl carrier protein. A chemical assay of the accessibility of the acyl thioester to solvent revealed a positive correlation between chain length and rate of hydrolysis. Surprisingly, this linear correlation was biphasic, with accelerated hydrolysis observed for fatty acids longer than 15 carbons. To further understand the motions associated with this acceleration, we collected (15)N relaxation dispersion data for 14:0-, 15:0-, and 16:0-ACP. The greatest dispersions were exhibited by residues that form the entrance to the fatty acid binding pocket. In addition, these dispersions were observed to increase with the length of the fatty acid. Because the exchange rates derived from fitting the data to a two-state model varied from residue to residue, a more complex motional model appears to be required to adequately explain the dynamics. Thus, acyl-ACP offers an interesting system for future investigations of complex protein motions on the micro- and millisecond time scales.	0
Title: A Salmonella inositol polyphosphatase acts in conjunction with other bacterial effectors to promote host cell actin cytoskeleton rearrangements and bacterial internalization Abstract: A central feature of Salmonella pathogenicity is the bacterium's ability to enter into non-phagocytic cells. Bacterial internalization is the consequence of cellular responses characterized by Cdc42- and Rac-dependent actin cytoskeleton rearrangements. These responses are triggered by the co-ordinated function of bacterial proteins delivered into the host cell by a specialized protein secretion system termed type III. We report here that SopB, a Salmonella inositol polyphosphatase delivered to the host cell by this secretion system, mediates actin cytoskeleton rearrangements and bacterial entry in a Cdc42-dependent manner. SopB exhibits overlapping functions with two other effectors of bacterial entry, the Rho family GTPase exchange factors SopE and SopE2. Thus, Salmonella strains deficient in any one of these proteins can enter into cells at high efficiency, whereas a strain lacking all three effectors is completely defective for entry. Consistent with an important role for inositol phosphate metabolism in Salmonella-induced cellular responses, a catalytically defective mutant of SopB failed to stimulate actin cytoskeleton rearrangements and bacterial entry. Furthermore, bacterial infection of intestinal cells resulted in a marked increase in Ins(1,4,5,6)P4, a consumption of InsP5 and the activation of phospholipase C. In agreement with the in vivo findings, purified SopB specifically dephosphorylated InsP5 to Ins(1,4,5,6)P4 in vitro. Surprisingly, the inositol phosphate fluxes induced by Salmonella were not caused exclusively by SopB. We show that the SopB-independent inositol phosphate fluxes are the consequence of the SopE-dependent activation of an endogenous inositol phosphatase. The ability of Salmonella to stimulate Rho GTPases signalling and inositol phosphate metabolism through alternative mechanisms is an example of the remarkable ability of this bacterial pathogen to manipulate host cellular functions.	0
Title: Characterization of the amicetin biosynthesis gene cluster from Streptomyces vinaceusdrappus NRRL 2363 implicates two alternative strategies for amide bond formation Abstract: Amicetin, an antibacterial and antiviral agent, belongs to a group of disaccharide nucleoside antibiotics featuring an α-(1→4)-glycoside bond in the disaccharide moiety. In this study, the amicetin biosynthesis gene cluster was cloned from Streptomyces vinaceusdrappus NRRL 2363 and localized on a 37-kb contiguous DNA region. Heterologous expression of the amicetin biosynthesis gene cluster in Streptomyces lividans TK64 resulted in the production of amicetin and its analogues, thereby confirming the identity of the ami gene cluster. In silico sequence analysis revealed that 21 genes were putatively involved in amicetin biosynthesis, including 3 for regulation and transportation, 10 for disaccharide biosynthesis, and 8 for the formation of the amicetin skeleton by the linkage of cytosine, p-aminobenzoic acid (PABA), and the terminal (+)-α-methylserine moieties. The inactivation of the benzoate coenzyme A (benzoate-CoA) ligase gene amiL and the N-acetyltransferase gene amiF led to two mutants that accumulated the same two compounds, cytosamine and 4-acetamido-3-hydroxybenzoic acid. These data indicated that AmiF functioned as an amide synthethase to link cytosine and PABA. The inactivation of amiR, encoding an acyl-CoA-acyl carrier protein transacylase, resulted in the production of plicacetin and norplicacetin, indicating AmiR to be responsible for attachment of the terminal methylserine moiety to form another amide bond. These findings implicated two alternative strategies for amide bond formation in amicetin biosynthesis.	1
Title: Activatable Singlet Oxygen Generation from Lipid Hydroperoxide Nanoparticles for Cancer Therapy Abstract: Reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced apoptosis is a widely practiced strategy for cancer therapy. Although photodynamic therapy (PDT) takes advantage of the spatial-temporal control of ROS generation, the meticulous participation of light, photosensitizer, and oxygen greatly hinders the broad application of PDT as a first-line cancer treatment option. An activatable system has been developed that enables tumor-specific singlet oxygen (1 O2 ) generation for cancer therapy, based on a Fenton-like reaction between linoleic acid hydroperoxide (LAHP) tethered on iron oxide nanoparticles (IO NPs) and the released iron(II) ions from IO NPs under acidic-pH condition. The IO-LAHP NPs are able to induce efficient apoptotic cancer cell death both in vitro and in vivo through tumor-specific 1 O2 generation and subsequent ROS mediated mechanism. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of modulating biochemical reactions as a ROS source to exert cancer death.	0
Title: Anthracycline metabolites from baumycin-producing Streptomyces sp. D788. II. New anthracycline metabolites produced by a blocked mutant strain RPM-5 Abstract: A daunorubicin-blocked mutant strain RPM-5 derived from a new baumycin-producing Streptomyces sp. D788 accumulated a major precursor metabolite D788-1 (10-carboxyl-13-deoxocarminomycin) and nine minor metabolites in the culture broth. Five among them were new with a substituent at C-10 or the altered side chains at C-9. Isolation, purification and identification of all anthracycline metabolites produced by strain RPM-5 are described with their antitumor activities against L1210 cells.	0
Title: In vitro Plasmodium falciparum drug sensitivity assay: inhibition of parasite growth by incorporation of stomatocytogenic amphiphiles into the erythrocyte membrane Abstract: Lupeol, which shows in vitro inhibitory activity against Plasmodium falciparum 3D7 strain with a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 27.7 +/- 0.5 microM, was shown to cause a transformation of the human erythrocyte shape toward that of stomatocytes. Good correlation between the IC50 value and the membrane curvature changes caused by lupeol was observed. Preincubation of erythrocytes with lupeol, followed by extensive washing, made the cells unsuitable for parasite growth, suggesting that the compound incorporates into erythrocyte membrane irreversibly. On the other hand, lupeol-treated parasite culture continued to grow well in untreated erythrocytes. Thus, the antiplasmodial activity of lupeol appears to be indirect, being due to stomatocytic transformation of the host cell membrane and not to toxic effects via action on a drug target within the parasite. A number of amphiphiles that cause stomatocyte formation, but not those causing echinocyte formation, were shown to inhibit growth of the parasites, apparently via a mechanism similar to that of lupeol. Since antiplasmodial agents that inhibit parasite growth through erythrocyte membrane modifications must be regarded as unsuitable as leads for development of new antimalarial drugs, care must be exercised in the interpretation of results of screening of plant extracts and natural product libraries by an in vitro Plasmodium toxicity assay.	0
Title: Fusaoctaxin A, an Example of a Two-Step Mechanism for Non-Ribosomal Peptide Assembly and Maturation in Fungi Abstract: Fungal non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) clusters are spread across the chromosomes, where several modifying enzyme-encoding genes typically flank one NRPS. However, a recent study showed that the octapeptide fusaoctaxin A is tandemly synthesized by two NRPSs in Fusarium graminearum. Here, we illuminate parts of the biosynthetic route of fusaoctaxin A, which is cleaved into the tripeptide fusatrixin A and the pentapeptide fusapentaxin A during transport by a cluster-specific ABC transporter with peptidase activity. Further, we deleted the histone H3K27 methyltransferase kmt6, which induced the production of fusaoctaxin A.	1
Title: Determination of the mechanism of free radical generation in human aortic endothelial cells exposed to anoxia and reoxygenation Abstract: Endothelial cell-derived oxygen free radicals are important mediators of postischemic injury; however, the mechanisms that trigger this radical generation are not known, and it is not known if this process can occur in human cells and tissues. The enzyme xanthine oxidase can be an important source of radical generation; however, it has been reported that this enzyme may not be present in human endothelium. To determine the presence and mechanisms of radical generation in human vascular endothelial cells subjected to anoxia and reoxygenation, electron paramagnetic resonance measurements were performed on cultured human aortic endothelial cells using the spin trap 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO). These measurements were correlated with cellular injury, xanthine oxidase activity, and alterations in cellular nucleotides. Upon reoxygenation after 60 min of anoxia, large DMPO-OH (aN = aH = 14.9 G) and smaller DMPO-R (aN = 15.8 G, aH = 22.8 G) signals were seen. Superoxide dismutase totally quenched this radical generation. The ferric iron chelator deferoxamine prevented cell death and totally quenched the DMPO-R signal with a 40% decrease in the DMPO-OH signal. Xanthine oxidase was shown to be present in these cells and to be the primary source of free radicals. While the concentration of this enzyme did not change after anoxia, the concentration of its substrate, hypoxanthine, markedly increased, resulting in increased free radical generation upon reoxygenation. Thus, reoxygenated human vascular endothelial cells generate superoxide free radicals, which further react with iron to form the reactive hydroxyl radical, which in turn causes cell death. Xanthine oxidase was the primary source of radical generation with this process triggered by the breakdown of ATP to the substrate hypoxanthine during anoxia.	0
Title: Capture of uropathogenic E. coli by using synthetic glycan ligands specific for the pap-pilus Abstract: Biotinylated mono- and biantennary di-/trisaccharides were synthesized to evaluate their ability to capture E. coli strains that express pilus types with different receptor specificities. The synthesized biotinylated di-/trisaccharides contain Galα(1→4)Gal, Galα(1→4)GalNHAc, GalNHAcα(1→4)Gal, Galα(1→4)Galβ(1→4)Glc and GalNHAcα(1→4)Galβ(1→4)Glc as carbohydrate epitopes. These biotinylated oligosaccharides were immobilized on streptavidin-coated magnetic beads, and incubated with different strains of live E. coli. Capturing ability was assessed by using a luciferase assay that detects bacterial ATP. The trisaccharides containing Galα(1→4)Galβ(1→4)Glc and the disaccharides containing Galα(1→4)Gal as the epitopes exhibited strong capturing ability for uropathogenic E. coli strains with the pap pilus genotype, including CFT073, J96 and J96 pilE. The same ligands failed to capture E. coli strains with fim, prs, or foc genotypes. Uropathogenic CFT073 was also captured moderately by biantennary disaccharides containing a GalNHAc moiety at the reducing end; however, other saccharides containing GalNHAc at the nonreducing end did not capture the CFT073 strain. These synthetic glycoconjugates could potentially be adapted as rapid diagnostic agents to differentiate between different E. coli pathovars.	0
Title: Biosynthetic gene cluster for the cladoniamides, bis-indoles with a rearranged scaffold Abstract: The cladoniamides are bis-indole alkaloids isolated from Streptomyces uncialis, a lichen-associated actinomycete strain. The cladoniamides have an unusual, indenotryptoline structure rarely observed among bis-indole alkaloids. I report here the isolation, sequencing, and annotation of the cladoniamide biosynthetic gene cluster and compare it to the recently published gene cluster for BE-54017, a closely related indenotryptoline natural product. The cladoniamide gene cluster differs from the BE-54017 gene cluster in gene organization and in the absence of one N-methyltransferase gene but otherwise contains close homologs to all genes in the BE-54017 cluster. Both gene clusters encode enzymes needed for the construction of an indolocarbazole core, as well as flavin-dependent enzymes putatively involved in generating the indenotryptoline scaffold from an indolocarbazole. These two bis-indolic gene clusters exemplify the diversity of biosynthetic routes that begin from the oxidative dimerization of two molecules of L-tryptophan, highlight enzymes for further study, and provide new opportunities for combinatorial engineering.	1
Title: Methylpyrrole tropane alkaloids from the bark of Erythroxylum vacciniifolium Abstract: Nine new tropane alkaloids substituted by a methylpyrrole moiety were isolated from the bark of Erythroxylum vacciniifolium, a Brazilian endemic plant used in traditional medicine and locally known as catuaba. All compounds were elucidated as tropanediol or -triol alkaloids esterified by at least one 1-methyl-1H-pyrrole-2-carboxylic acid. One of the isolated compounds was identified as a tropane alkaloid N-oxide. Their structures were determined by high-resolution mass spectrometry and multidimensional NMR spectroscopy.	0
Title: In Vitro Biosynthesis of the Core Scaffold of the Thiopeptide Thiomuracin Abstract: Thiopeptides are potent antibiotics that inhibit protein synthesis. They are made by a remarkable post-translational modification process that transforms a linear peptide into a polycyclic structure. We present here the in vitro biosynthesis of the core scaffold of thiomuracin catalyzed by six proteins. We show that cyclodehydration precedes dehydration, and that dehydration is catalyzed by two proteins in a tRNA(Glu)-dependent manner. The enzyme that generates the pyridine core from two dehydroalanines ejects the leader peptide as a C-terminal carboxamide. Mutagenesis studies of the enzyme TbtD identified important residues for a formal [4+2] cycloaddition process. The core structure of thiomuracin exhibits similar antimicrobial activity to other known congeners, illustrating that in vitro biosynthesis is a viable route to potent antibiotics that can be explored for the rapid and renewable generation of analogues.	1
Title: Identification and characterization of the Staphylococcus aureus gene cluster coding for staphyloferrin A Abstract: Siderophores are key virulence factors that allow bacteria to grow in iron-restricted environments. The Gram-positive pathogen Staphylococcus aureus is known to produce four siderophores for which genetic and/or structural data are unknown. Here we characterize the gene cluster responsible for producing the prevalent siderophore staphyloferrin A. In addition to expressing the cluster in the heterologous host Escherichia coli, which confers the ability to synthesize the siderophore, we reconstituted staphyloferrin A biosynthesis in vitro by expressing and purifying two key enzymes in the pathway. As with other polycarboxylate siderophores, staphyloferrin A is biosynthesized using the recently described nonribosomal peptide synthetase independent siderophore (NIS) biosynthetic pathway. Two NIS synthetases condense two molecules of citric acid to d-ornithine in a stepwise ordered process with SfnaD using the delta-amine as a nucleophile to form the first amide followed by SfnaB utilizing the alpha-amine to complete staphyloferrin A synthesis.	1
Title: Chemical characterisation of disruptants of the Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) actVI genes involved in actinorhodin biosynthesis Abstract: The actVI genetic region of Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) is part of the biosynthetic gene cluster of actinorhodin (ACT), the act cluster, consisting of six ORFs: ORFB, ORFA, ORF1, ORF2, ORF3, ORF4. A newly devised method of ACT detection with a combination of HPLC and LC/MS was applied to the analysis of the disruptants of each ORF. ACT was produced by those of ORFB, ORFA, ORF3, and ORF4. Instead of ACT, the ORF1 disruptant produced 3,8-dihydroxy-1-methylanthraquinone-2-carboxylic acid (DMAC) and aloesaponarin II as shunt products. The ORF2 disruptant gave 4-dihydro-9-hydroxy-1-methyl-10-oxo-3-H-naphtho-[2,3-c]-pyran-3-(S)-acet ic acid, (S)-DNPA. These results support our previous proposal for stereospecific pyran ring formation in the biosynthesis of ACT, most importantly suggesting that the actVI-ORF2 product would recognize (S)-DNPA as a substrate for stereospecific reduction at C-15. The disruptant of ORFA produced (S)-DNPA together with ACT, suggesting that actVI-ORFA might play a role such as stabilising the multicomponent, type II PKS complex.	1
Title: Calculations predict that carbon tunneling allows the degenerate cope rearrangement of semibullvalene to occur rapidly at cryogenic temperatures Abstract: Calculations on the role of tunneling in the degenerate Cope rearrangements of semibullvalene (1) and barbaralane (3) predict that, at temperatures below 40 K, tunneling from the lowest vibrational level should make the temperature-independent rate constants k = 1.43 x 10(-3) s(-1) and k = 7.28 x 10(-9) s(-1), respectively. An experiment, using semibullvalene-2(4)-d(1), is proposed to test the prediction of rapid tunneling by 1 at cryogenic temperatures.	0
Title: The lipopeptide antibiotic A54145 biosynthetic gene cluster from Streptomyces fradiae Abstract: Ca(2+)-dependent cyclic lipodepsipeptides are an emerging class of antibiotics for the treatment of infections caused by Gram-positive pathogens. These compounds are synthesized by nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) complexes encoded by large gene clusters. The gene cluster encoding biosynthetic pathway enzymes for the Streptomyces fradiae A54145 NRP was cloned from a cosmid library and characterized. Four NRPS-encoding genes, responsible for subunits of the synthetase, as well as genes for accessory functions such as acylation, methylation and hydroxylation, were identified by sequence analysis in a 127 kb region of DNA that appears to be located subterminally in the bacterial chromosome. Deduced epimerase domain-encoding sequences within the NRPS genes indicated a D: -stereochemistry for Glu, Lys and Asn residues, as observed for positionally analogous residues in two related compounds, daptomycin, and the calcium-dependent antibiotic (CDA) produced by Streptomyces roseosporus and Streptomyces coelicolor, respectively. A comparison of the structure and the biosynthetic gene cluster of A54145 with those of the related peptides showed many similarities. This information may contribute to the design of experiments to address both fundamental and applied questions in lipopeptide biosynthesis, engineering and drug development.	1
Title: Role of MbtH-like proteins in the adenylation of tyrosine during aminocoumarin and vancomycin biosynthesis Abstract: MbtH-like proteins consist of ∼70 amino acids and are encoded in the biosynthetic gene clusters of non-ribosomally formed peptides and other secondary metabolites derived from amino acids. Recently, several MbtH-like proteins have been shown to be required for the adenylation of amino acid in non-ribosomal peptide synthesis. We now investigated the role of MbtH-like proteins in the biosynthesis of the aminocoumarin antibiotics novobiocin, clorobiocin, and simocyclinone D8 and of the glycopeptide antibiotic vancomycin. The tyrosine-adenylating enzymes CloH, SimH, and Pcza361.18, involved in the biosynthesis of clorobiocin, simocyclinone D8, and vancomycin, respectively, required the presence of MbtH-like proteins in a 1:1 molar ratio, forming heterotetrameric complexes. In contrast, NovH, involved in novobiocin biosynthesis, showed activity in the absence of MbtH-like proteins. Comparison of the active centers of CloH and NovH showed only one amino acid to be different, i.e. Leu-383 versus Met-383. Mutation of this amino acid in CloH (L383M) indeed led to MbtH-independent adenylating activity. All investigated tyrosine-adenylating enzymes exhibited remarkable promiscuity for MbtH-like proteins from different pathways and organisms. YbdZ, the MbtH-like protein from the expression host Escherichia coli, was found to bind to adenylating enzymes during expression and to influence their biochemical properties markedly. Therefore, the use of ybdZ-deficient expression hosts is important in biochemical studies of adenylating enzymes.	1
Title: The biosynthetic pathway to tetromadurin (SF2487/A80577), a polyether tetronate antibiotic Abstract: The type I polyketide SF2487/A80577 (herein referred to as tetromadurin) is a polyether tetronate ionophore antibiotic produced by the terrestrial Gram-positive bacterium Actinomadura verrucosospora. Tetromadurin is closely related to the polyether tetronates tetronasin (M139603) and tetronomycin, all of which are characterised by containing a tetronate, cyclohexane, tetrahydropyran, and at least one tetrahydrofuran ring. We have sequenced the genome of Actinomadura verrucosospora to identify the biosynthetic gene cluster responsible for tetromadurin biosynthesis (the mad gene cluster). Based on bioinformatic analysis of the 32 genes present within the cluster a plausible biosynthetic pathway for tetromadurin biosynthesis is proposed. Functional confirmation of the mad gene cluster is obtained by performing in-frame deletions in each of the genes mad10 and mad31, which encode putative cyclase enzymes responsible for cyclohexane and tetrahydropyran formation, respectively. Furthermore, the A. verrucosospora Δmad10 mutant produces a novel tetromadurin metabolite that according to mass spectrometry analysis is analogous to the recently characterised partially cyclised tetronasin intermediate lacking its cyclohexane and tetrahydropyran rings. Our results therefore elucidate the biosynthetic machinery of tetromadurin biosynthesis and lend support for a conserved mechanism of cyclohexane and tetrahydropyran biosynthesis across polyether tetronates.	1
Title: Functional expression of the ectoine hydroxylase gene (thpD) from Streptomyces chrysomallus in Halomonas elongata Abstract: The formation of hydroxyectoine in the industrial ectoine producer Halomonas elongata was improved by the heterologous expression of the ectoine hydroxylase gene, thpD, from Streptomyces chrysomallus. The efficient conversion of ectoine to hydroxyectoine was achieved by the concerted regulation of thpD by the H. elongata ectA promoter.	1
Title: Synthesis of demissidine by a ring fragmentation 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition approach Abstract: A synthesis of the steroidal alkaloid demissidine from epiandrosterone is reported. A ring fragmentation reaction that efficiently ruptured the D-ring of a diazo ester derivative of epiandrosterone to provide an aldehyde tethered ynoate product was key to this sequence. Incorporation of the indolizidine framework was achieved by an azomethine ylide 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition.	0
Title: Endophytic Bacterium-Triggered Reactive Oxygen Species Directly Increase Oxygenous Sesquiterpenoid Content and Diversity in Atractylodes lancea Abstract: Oxygenous terpenoids are active components of many medicinal plants. However, current studies that have focused on enzymatic oxidation reactions cannot comprehensively clarify the mechanisms of oxygenous terpenoid synthesis and diversity. This study shows that an endophytic bacterium can trigger the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that directly increase oxygenous sesquiterpenoid content and diversity in Atractylodes lancea. A. lancea is a famous but endangered Chinese medicinal plant that contains abundant oxygenous sesquiterpenoids. Geo-authentic A. lancea produces a wider range and a greater abundance of oxygenous sesquiterpenoids than the cultivated herb. Our previous studies have shown the mechanisms behind endophytic promotion of the production of sesquiterpenoid hydrocarbon scaffolds; however, how endophytes promote the formation of oxygenous sesquiterpenoids and their diversity is unclear. After colonization by Pseudomonas fluorescens ALEB7B, oxidative burst and oxygenous sesquiterpenoid accumulation in A. lancea occur synchronously. Treatment with exogenous hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) or singlet oxygen induces oxidative burst and promotes oxygenous sesquiterpenoid accumulation in planta. Conversely, pretreatment of plantlets with the ROS scavenger ascorbic acid significantly inhibits the oxidative burst and oxygenous sesquiterpenoid accumulation induced by P. fluorescens ALEB7B. Further in vitro oxidation experiments show that several oxygenous sesquiterpenoids can be obtained from direct oxidation caused by H2O2 or singlet oxygen. In summary, this study demonstrates that endophytic bacterium-triggered ROS can directly oxidize oxygen-free sesquiterpenoids and increase the oxygenous sesquiterpenoid content and diversity in A. lancea, providing a novel explanation of the mechanisms of oxygenous terpenoid synthesis in planta and an essential complementarity to enzymatic oxidation reactions.	0
Title: CouO and NovO: C-methyltransferases for tailoring the aminocoumarin scaffold in coumermycin and novobiocin antibiotic biosynthesis Abstract: During the biosynthesis of the streptomycete aminocoumarin antibiotics novobiocin and the dimeric coumermycin A(1), the bicyclic coumarin scaffold is C-methylated adjacent to the phenolic oxygen. The SAM-dependent C-methyltransferases NovO and CouO have been heterologously expressed and purified from Escherichia coli and shown to act after the aminocoumarin ring has been constructed by prior action of Nov/CouHIJK. Neither C-methyltransferase works on the tyrosyl-derived S-pantetheinyl intermediates tethered to NovH or on the subsequently released free aminocoumarin. NovL ligates the aminocoumarin to prenylhydroxybenzoate to yield novobiocic acid, which is the substrate for NovO before it is O-glycosylated by NovM. In coumermycin assembly, the corresponding ligase CouL makes the bis-amide by tandem ligation of two aminocoumarins to a dicarboxypyrrole. CouO works on both the mono- and bis-amides for mono- and di-C-methylation adjacent to the phenolic hydroxyl before it is glycosylated by CouM. Thus, the specific timing of C-methylation in the aminocoumarin antibiotic pathways is established.	1
Title: Terpenoid tetrahydroisoquinoline alkaloids emetine, klugine, and isocephaeline inhibit the activation of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 in breast tumor cells Abstract: Klugine (1), isocephaeline (2), and emetine (4) inhibited hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) activation by hypoxia in T47D breast tumor cells (IC(50) values 0.2, 1.1, and 0.11 muM, respectively). Compounds 1, 2, and 4 inhibited both hypoxia- and iron chelator-induced HIF-1 activation by blocking HIF-1alpha protein accumulation.	0
Title: Comparative Profiling and Discovery of Novel Glycosylated Mycosporine-Like Amino Acids in Two Strains of the Cyanobacterium Scytonema cf. crispum Abstract: The mycosporine-like amino acids (MAAs) are a group of small molecules with a diverse ecological distribution among microorganisms. MAAs have a range of physiological functions, including protection against UV radiation, making them important from a biotechnological perspective. In the present study, we identified a putative MAA (mys) gene cluster in two New Zealand isolates of Scytonema cf. crispum (UCFS10 and UCFS15). Homology to "Anabaena-type" mys clusters suggested that this cluster was likely to be involved in shinorine biosynthesis. Surprisingly, high-performance liquid chromatography analysis of S cf. crispum cell extracts revealed a complex MAA profile, including shinorine, palythine-serine, and their hexose-bound variants. It was hypothesized that a short-chain dehydrogenase (UCFS15_00405) encoded by a gene adjacent to the S cf. crispum mys cluster was responsible for the conversion of shinorine to palythine-serine. Heterologous expression of MysABCE and UCFS15_00405 in Escherichia coli resulted in the exclusive production of the parent compound shinorine. Taken together, these results suggest that shinorine biosynthesis in S cf. crispum proceeds via an Anabaena-type mechanism and that the genes responsible for the production of other MAA analogues, including palythine-serine and glycosylated analogues, may be located elsewhere in the genome.                  Importance:                       Recently, New Zealand isolates of S cf. crispum were linked to the production of paralytic shellfish toxins for the first time, but no other natural products from this species have been reported. Thus, the species was screened for important natural product biosynthesis. The mycosporine-like amino acids (MAAs) are among the strongest absorbers of UV radiation produced in nature. The identification of novel MAAs is important from a biotechnology perspective, as these molecules are able to be utilized as sunscreens. This study has identified two novel MAAs that have provided several new avenues of future research related to MAA genetics and biosynthesis. Further, we have revealed that the genetic basis of MAA biosynthesis may not be clustered on the genome. The identification of the genes responsible for MAA biosynthesis is vital for future genetic engineering.	1
Title: An unusual amide synthetase (CouL) from the coumermycin A1 biosynthetic gene cluster from Streptomyces rishiriensis DSM 40489 Abstract: The aminocoumarin antibiotic coumermycin A1 produced by Streptomyces rishiriensis DSM 40489 contains two amide bonds. The biosynthetic gene cluster of coumermycin contains a putative amide synthetase gene, couL, encoding a protein of 529 amino acids. CouL was overexpressed as hexahistidine fusion protein in Escherichia coli and purified by metal affinity chromatography, resulting in a nearly homogenous protein. CouL catalysed the formation of both amide bonds of coumermycin A1, i.e. between the central 3-methylpyrrole-2,4-dicarboxylic acid and two aminocoumarin moieties. Gel exclusion chromatography showed that the enzyme is active as a monomer. The activity was strictly dependent on the presence of ATP and Mn2+ or Mg2+. The apparent Km values were determined as 26 micro m for the 3-methylpyrrole-2,4-dicarboxylic acid and 44 micro m for the aminocoumarin moiety, respectively. Several analogues of the pyrrole dicarboxylic acid were accepted as substrates. In contrast, pyridine carboxylic acids were not accepted. 3-Dimethylallyl-4-hydroxybenzoic acid, the acyl component in novobiocin biosynthesis, was well accepted, despite its structural difference from the genuine acyl substrate of CouL.	1
Title: NKT cell stimulation with α-galactosylceramide results in a block of Th17 differentiation after intranasal immunization in mice Abstract: In a previous study we demonstrated that intranasal (i.n.) vaccination promotes a Th17 biased immune response. Here, we show that co-administration of a pegylated derivative of α-galactosylceramide (αGCPEG) with an antigen, even in the presence of Th17-polarizing compounds, results in a strong blocking of Th17 differentiation. Additional studies demonstrated that this phenomenon is specifically dependent on soluble factors, like IL-4 and IFNγ, which are produced by NKT cells. Even NK1.1 negative NKT cells, which by themselves produce IL-17A, are able to block Th17 differentiation. It follows that the use of αGCPEG as adjuvant would enable to tailor Th17 responses, according to the specific clinical needs. This knowledge expands our understanding of the role played by NKT cells in overall control of the cytokine microenvironment, as well as in the overall shaping of adaptive immune responses.	0
Title: Multiple regulatory genes in the salinomycin biosynthetic gene cluster of Streptomyces albus CCM 4719 Abstract: A DNA fragment containing part of the salinomycin biosynthetic gene cluster from industrial strain Streptomyces albus CCM 4719 was cloned. Sequence analysis of the 25.809-kbp fragment revealed the presence of 8 open reading frames (ORFs), including two large ORFs encoding three modular sets of oligoketide synthase, followed by three genes (salRI, salRII, salRIII) encoding transcriptional regulators. The first two regulators, SalRI and SalRII, belonged to the novel LAL family of large transcriptional regulators. SalRIII was highly similar to the NysRIV, AmphRIV, and FscRI transcriptional regulators from the oligoene macrolides nystatin, amphotericin, and R008/candicidin clusters, respectively.	1
Title: A gene cluster containing two fungal polyketide synthases encodes the biosynthetic pathway for a polyketide, asperfuranone, in Aspergillus nidulans Abstract: The genome sequencing of Aspergillus species including A. nidulans reveals that the products of many of the secondary metabolism pathways in these fungi have not been elucidated. Our examination of the 27 polyketide synthases (PKS) in A. nidulans revealed that one highly reduced PKS (HR-PKS, AN1034.3) and one nonreduced PKS (NR-PKS, AN1036.3) are located next to each other in the genome. Since no known A. nidulans secondary metabolites could be produced by two PKS enzymes, we hypothesized that this cryptic gene cluster produces an unknown natural product. Indeed after numerous attempts we found that the products from this cluster could not be detected under normal laboratory culture conditions in wild type strains. Closer examination of the gene cluster revealed a gene with high homology to a citrinin biosynthesis transcriptional activator (CtnR, 32% identity/47% similarity), a fungal transcription activator located next to the two PKSs. We replaced the promoter of the transcription activator with the inducible alcA promoter, which enabled the production of a novel polyketide that we have named asperfuranone. A series of gene deletions has allowed us to confirm that the two PKSs together with five additional genes comprise the asperfuranone biosynthetic pathway and leads us to propose a biosynthetic pathway for asperfuranone. Our results confirm and substantiate the potential to discover novel compounds even from a well-studied fungus by using a genomic mining approach.	1
Title: Bi- and Tetracyclic Spirotetronates from the Coal Mine Fire Isolate Streptomyces sp. LC-6-2 Abstract: The structures of 12 new "enantiomeric"-like abyssomicin metabolites (abyssomicins M-X) from Streptomyces sp. LC-6-2 are reported. Of this set, the abyssomicin W (11) contains an unprecedented 8/6/6/6 tetracyclic core, while the bicyclic abyssomicin X (12) represents the first reported naturally occurring linear spirotetronate. Metabolite structures were determined based on spectroscopic data and X-ray crystallography, and Streptomyces sp. LC-6-2 genome sequencing also revealed the corresponding putative biosynthetic gene cluster.	1
Title: NovG, a DNA-binding protein acting as a positive regulator of novobiocin biosynthesis Abstract: The biosynthetic gene cluster of the aminocoumarin antibiotic novobiocin contains two putative regulatory genes, i.e. novE and novG. The predicted gene product of novG shows a putative helix-turn-helix DNA-binding motif and shares sequence similarity with StrR, a well-studied pathway-specific transcriptional activator of streptomycin biosynthesis. Here functional proof is provided, by genetic and biochemical approaches, for the role of NovG as a positive regulator of novobiocin biosynthesis. The entire novobiocin cluster of the producer organism Streptomyces spheroides was expressed in the heterologous host Streptomyces coelicolor M512, and additional strains were produced which lacked the novG gene within the heterologously expressed cluster. These Delta novG strains produced only 2% of the novobiocin formed by the S. coelicolor M512 strains carrying the intact novobiocin cluster. The production could be restored by introducing an intact copy of novG into the mutant. The presence of novG on a multicopy plasmid in the strain containing the intact cluster led to almost threefold overproduction of the antibiotic, suggesting that novobiocin biosynthesis is limited by the availability of NovG protein. Furthermore, purified N-terminal His(6)-tagged NovG showed specific DNA-binding activity for the novG-novH and the cloG-cloY intergenic regions of the novobiocin and clorobiocin biosynthetic gene clusters, respectively. By comparing the DNA sequences of the fragments binding NovG, conserved inverted repeats were identified in both fragments, similar to those identified as the binding sites for StrR. The consensus sequence for the StrR and the putative NovG binding sites was GTTCRACTG(N)(11)CRGTYGAAC. Therefore, NovG and StrR apparently belong to the same family of DNA-binding regulatory proteins.	1
Title: The Northern Route for Human dispersal in Central and Northeast Asia: New evidence from the site of Tolbor-16, Mongolia Abstract: The fossil record suggests that at least two major human dispersals occurred across the Eurasian steppe during the Late Pleistocene. Neanderthals and Modern Humans moved eastward into Central Asia, a region intermittently occupied by the enigmatic Denisovans. Genetic data indicates that the Denisovans interbred with Neanderthals near the Altai Mountains (South Siberia) but where and when they met H. sapiens is yet to be determined. Here we present archaeological evidence that document the timing and environmental context of a third long-distance population movement in Central Asia, during a temperate climatic event around 45,000 years ago. The early occurrence of the Initial Upper Palaeolithic, a techno-complex whose sudden appearance coincides with the first occurrence of H. sapiens in the Eurasian steppes, establishes an essential archaeological link between the Siberian Altai and Northwestern China . Such connection between regions provides empirical ground to discuss contacts between local and exogenous populations in Central and Northeast Asia during the Late Pleistocene.	0
Title: Comparative inhibitory activity of BL-S640 and two other cephalosporins Abstract: In vitro antibacterial activity of BL-S640 was compared to that of cephalothin and cephalexin against Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria isolated from clinical specimens. BL-S640 demonstrated the best activity on nearly all microbial species studied, except for Haemophilus influenzae and Diplococcus pneumoniae against which cephalothin was slightly more active.	0
Title: Amplification, Decoherence, and the Acquisition of Information by Spin Environments Abstract: Quantum Darwinism recognizes the role of the environment as a communication channel: Decoherence can selectively amplify information about the pointer states of a system of interest (preventing access to complementary information about their superpositions) and can make records of this information accessible to many observers. This redundancy explains the emergence of objective, classical reality in our quantum Universe. Here, we demonstrate that the amplification of information in realistic spin environments can be quantified by the quantum Chernoff information, which characterizes the distinguishability of partial records in individual environment subsystems. We show that, except for a set of initial states of measure zero, the environment always acquires redundant information. Moreover, the Chernoff information captures the rich behavior of amplification in both finite and infinite spin environments, from quadratic growth of the redundancy to oscillatory behavior. These results will considerably simplify experimental testing of quantum Darwinism, e.g., using nitrogen vacancies in diamond.	0
Title: Genomic organization, sequence analysis and expression of all five genes encoding the small subunit of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase from tomato Abstract: We have cloned and sequenced all five members of the gene family for the small subunit (rbcS) of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase from tomato, Lycopersicon esculentum cv. VFNT LA 1221 cherry line. Two of the five genes, designated Rbcs-1 and Rbcs-2, are present as single genes at individual loci. Three genes, designated Rbcs-3A, Rbcs-3B and Rbcs-3C, are organized in a tandem array within 10 kb at a third independent locus. The Rbcs-2 gene contains three introns; all the other members of the tomato gene family contain two introns. The coding sequence of Rbcs-1 differs by 14.0% from that of Rbcs-2 and by 13.3% from that of Rbcs-3 genes. Rbcs-2 shows 10.4% divergence from Rbcs-3. The exon and intron sequences of Rbcs-3A are identical to those of Rbcs-3C, and differ by 1.9% from those of Rbcs-3B. Nucleotide sequence analysis suggests that the five rbcS genes encode four different precursors, and three different mature polypeptides. S1 nuclease mapping of the 5' end of rbcS mRNAs revealed that the mRNA leader sequences vary in length from 8 to 75 nucleotides. Northern analysis using gene-specific oligonucleotide probes from the 3' non-coding region of each gene reveals a four to five-fold difference among the five genes in maximal steady-state mRNA levels in leaves.	0
Title: Expression and DNA binding activity of the tomato transcription factor RIN (ripening inhibitor) Abstract: Recently, we have found that the accumulation of ripening inhibitor (RIN) protein increased gradually during tomato fruit ripening. Here, the recombinant protein was expressed in Escherichia coli and affinity-purified. The DNA binding activity of renatured RIN protein was tested by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. The results indicated that an optimal expression and purification system was suitable for obtaining active RIN with DNA binding activity.	0
Title: Vitamin B12 partners the CarH repressor to downregulate a photoinducible promoter in Myxococcus xanthus Abstract: A light-inducible promoter, P(B), drives expression of the carB operon in Myxococcus xanthus. Repressed by CarA in the dark, P(B) is activated when CarS, produced in the light, sequesters CarA to prevent operator-CarA binding. The MerR-type, N-terminal domain of CarA, which mediates interactions with both operator and CarS, is linked to a C-terminal oligomerization module with a predicted cobalamin-binding motif. Here, we show that although CarA does bind vitamin B12, mutating the motif involved has no effect on its ability to repress P(B). Intriguingly, P(B) could be repressed in the dark even with no CarA, so long as B12 and an intact CarA operator were present. We have discovered that this effect of B12 depends on the gene immediately downstream of carA. Its product, CarH, also consists of a MerR-type, N-terminal domain that specifically recognizes the CarA operator and CarS, linked to a predicted B12-binding C-terminal oligomerization module. The B12-mediated repression of P(B) in the dark is relieved by deleting carH, by mutating the DNA- or B12-binding residues of CarH, or by illumination. Our findings unveil parallel regulatory circuits that control a light-inducible promoter using a transcriptional factor repertoire that includes a paralogous gene pair and vitamin B12.	1
Title: Feed-forward regulation of microbisporicin biosynthesis in Microbispora corallina Abstract: Lantibiotics are ribosomally synthesized, posttranslationally modified peptide antibiotics. Microbisporicin is a potent lantibiotic produced by the actinomycete Microbispora corallina and contains unique chlorinated tryptophan and dihydroxyproline residues. The biosynthetic gene cluster for microbisporicin encodes several putative regulatory proteins, including, uniquely, an extracytoplasmic function (ECF) σ factor, σ(MibX), a likely cognate anti-σ factor, MibW, and a potential helix-turn-helix DNA binding protein, MibR. Here we examine the roles of these proteins in regulating microbisporicin biosynthesis. S1 nuclease protection assays were used to determine transcriptional start sites in the microbisporicin gene cluster and confirmed the presence of the likely ECF sigma factor -10 and -35 sequences in five out of six promoters. In contrast, the promoter of mibA, encoding the microbisporicin prepropeptide, has a typical Streptomyces vegetative sigma factor consensus sequence. The ECF sigma factor σ(MibX) was shown to interact with the putative anti-sigma factor MibW in Escherichia coli using bacterial two-hybrid analysis. σ(MibX) autoregulates its own expression but does not directly regulate expression of mibA. On the basis of quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR) data, we propose a model for the biosynthesis of microbisporicin in which MibR functions as an essential master regulator and the ECF sigma factor/anti-sigma factor pair, σ(MibX)/MibW, induces feed-forward biosynthesis of microbisporicin and producer immunity.	1
Title: Engineered biosynthesis of nonribosomal lipopeptides with modified fatty acid side chains Abstract: The biological properties of the calcium-dependent antibiotics (CDAs), daptomycin and related nonribosomal lipopeptides, depend to a large extent on the nature of the N-terminal fatty acid moiety. It is suggested that the chain length of the unusually short (C6) 2,3-epoxyhexanoyl fatty acid moiety of CDA is determined by the specificity of the KAS-II enzyme encoded by fabF3 in the CDA biosynthetic gene cluster. Indeed, deletion of the downstream gene hxcO results in three new lipopeptides, all of which possess hexanoyl side chains (hCDAs). This confirms that HxcO functions as a hexanoyl-CoA or -ACP oxidase. The absence of additional CDA products with longer fatty acid groups further suggests that the CDA lipid chain is biosynthesized on a single ACP and is then transferred directly from this ACP to the first CDA peptide synthetase (CdaPS1). Interestingly, the hexanoyl-containing CDAs retain antibiotic activity. To further modulate the biological properties of CDA by introducing alternative fatty acid groups, a mutasynthesis approach was developed. This involved mutating the key active site Ser residue of the CdaPS1, module 1 PCP domain to Ala, which prevents subsequent phosphopantetheinylation. In the absence of the natural module 1 PCP tethered intermediate, it is possible to effect incorporation of different N-acyl-L-serinyl N-acetylcysteamine (NAC) thioester analogues, leading to CDA products with pentanoyl as well as hexanoyl side chains.	1
Title: Anti-HIV Tigliane-Type Diterpenoids from the Aerial Parts of Wikstroemia lichiangensis Abstract: Tigliane-type diterpenoids have attracted much attention in drug discovery since they have been reported to exhibit remarkable biological effects, such as tumor-promoting, antineoplastic, and anti-HIV activities. In continuing our efforts to discover novel biologically important diterpenoids from Wikstroemia species, Wikstroemia lichiangensis was investigated phytochemically for the first time. As a result, four new (1-4) and one known (5) tigliane-type diterpenoid were isolated, and their structures were elucidated by spectroscopic data analysis. Tiglianes (1-5) showed potent anti-HIV activity against HIV-1 infection of MT4 lymphocytes with IC50 values of 1.1-65.4 nM.	0
Title: In situ transformation of TON silica zeolite into the less dense ITW: structure-direction overcoming framework instability in the synthesis of SiO2 zeolites Abstract: Under specific synthesis conditions the crystallization of a dense silica zeolite (TON) is followed by its in situ transformation into a less dense and, in the absence of occluded species, less stable zeolite (ITW). Periodic ab initio calculations including energy corrections for van der Waals interactions as well as zero-point and thermal effects are used first to assess the relative stability of both SiO(2) (calcined) phases and then to investigate host-guest interactions in the as-made zeolites, as well as their relative stability. The less dense SiO(2)-ITW is less stable than SiO(2)-TON, with an energy difference that is significantly larger than expected from their difference in molar volume. This extra destabilization is ascribed to the strained double 4-ring units of silica tetrahedra (D4R). Regarding the as-made materials, the organic cation fills in more efficiently the zeolitic voids in ITW than in TON, bringing about a larger stabilization in the former owing to the extension of the long-range addition of dispersion force contributions. On the other hand, fluoride induces a polarization of the silica framework that is highly localized in TON (showing pentacoordinated [SiO(4/2)F](-) units) but has a large global character in ITW (where fluoride is encapsulated into D4R units). We argue that the structure-directing role toward D4R materials that has been proposed for fluoride consists fundamentally in the ability to induce a global polarization of the silica framework that allows relaxation of the strain associated with these units. In this sense, fluoride stabilizes the otherwise strained D4R-SiO(2) frameworks making them reachable for crystallization. This work documents a case in which the structure directing agents "choose" a structure not kinetically but through stabilization.	0
Title: Cloning and heterologous expression of three type II PKS gene clusters from Streptomyces bottropensis Abstract: Mensacarcin is a potent cytotoxic agent isolated from Streptomyces bottropensis. It possesses a high content of oxygen atoms and two epoxide groups, and shows cytostatic and cytotoxic activity comparable to that of doxorubicin, a widely used drug for antitumor therapy. Another natural compound, rishirilide A, was also isolated from the fermentation broth of S. bottropensis. Screening a cosmid library of S. bottropensis with minimal PKS-gene-specific primers revealed the presence of three different type II polyketide synthase (PKS) gene clusters in this strain: the msn cluster (mensacarcin biosynthesis), the rsl cluster (rishirilide biosynthesis), and the mec cluster (putative spore pigment biosynthesis). Interestingly, luciferase-like oxygenases, which are very rare in Streptomyces species, are enriched in both the msn cluster and the rsl cluster. Three cosmids, cos2 (containing the major part of the msn cluster), cos3 (harboring the mec cluster), and cos4 (spanning probably the whole rsl cluster) were introduced into the general heterologous host Streptomyces albus by intergeneric conjugation. Expression of cos2 and cos4 in S. albus led to the production of didesmethylmensacarcin (DDMM, a precursor of mensacarcin) and the production of rishirilide A and B (a precursor of rishirilide A), respectively. However, no product was detected from the expression of cos3. In addition, based on the results of isotope-feeding experiments in S. bottropensis, a putative biosynthesis pathway for mensacarcin is proposed.	1
Title: Discovery of novel Vibrio cholerae VSP-II genomic islands using comparative genomic analysis Abstract: This report describes Vibrio seventh pandemic island II (VSP-II) and three novel variants revealed by comparative genomics of 23 Vibrio cholerae strains and their presence among a large and diverse collection of V. cholerae isolates. Three VSP-II variants were reported previously and our results demonstrate the presence of three novel VSP-II in clinical and environmental V. cholerae marked by major deletions and genetic rearrangements. A new VSP-II cluster was found in the seventh pandemic V. cholerae O1 El Tor strain CIRS101, which is dominant (95%) among the recent (2004-2007) seven pandemic V. cholerae O1 El Tor isolates from two endemic sites, but was not found in older strains from the same region. Two other variants were found in V. cholerae TMA21 and RC385, two environmental strains from coastal Brazil and the Chesapeake Bay, respectively, the latter being prevalent among environmental V. cholerae non-O1/non-O139 and Vibrio mimicus. The results of this study indicate that the VSP-II island has undergone significant rearrangement through a complex evolutionary pathway in V. cholerae. Interestingly, one of the new VSP-II revealed the presence of 'old' and 'new' V. cholerae O1 El Tor pandemic clones circulating in some of the areas where cholera is endemic.	0
Title: The effect of anode potential on current production from complex substrates in bioelectrochemical systems: a case study with glucose Abstract: Anode potential can affect the degradation pathway of complex substrates in bioelectrochemical systems (BESs), thereby influencing current production and coulombic efficiency. However, the intricacies behind this interplay are poorly understood. This study used glucose as a model substrate to comprehensively investigate the effect of different anode potentials (- 150 mV, 0 mV and + 200 mV) on the relationship between current production, the electrogenic pathway and the abundance of the electrogenic microorganisms involved in batch mode fed BESs. Current production in glucose-acclimatized reactors was a function of the abundance of Geobacteraceae and of the availability of acetate and formate produced by glucose degradation. Current production was increased by high anode potentials during acclimation (0 mV and + 200 mV), likely due to more Geobacteraceae developing. However, this effect was much weaker than a stimulus from an artificial high acetate supply: acetate was the rate-limiting intermediate in these systems. The supply of acetate could not be influenced by anode potential; altering the flow regime, batch time and management of the upstream fermentation processes may be a greater engineering tool in BES. However, these findings suggest that if high current production is the focus, it will be extremely difficult to achieve success with complex waste streams such as domestic wastewater.	0
Title: FL-120A-D', new products related to kinamycin from Streptomyces chattanoogensis subsp. taitungensis subsp. nov. II. Isolation and structure determination Abstract: Six new kinamycin antibiotics have been isolated from the culture filtrate of Streptomyces chattanoogensis. The structures of six related components were determined employing 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. These structures represent the first reported epoxide kinamycin (2, 3) and propionyl derivative of kinamycin (5), and new isobutyryl derivatives of kinamycin (1, 4, 6).	0
Title: Genome mining and biosynthesis of kitacinnamycins as a STING activator Abstract: Cinnamoyl-containing nonribosomal peptides (CCNPs) are a small group of secondary metabolites with potent biological activities produced by actinobacteria. Two remarkable features in the biosynthesis of CCNPs include the nonribosomal peptide synthases (NRPSs) for assembly of the depsipeptide backbone and the type II polyketide synthases (PKSs) for N-terminal cinnamoyl moiety construction. Here, we present a genome mining approach targeting both NRPS and type II PKS for discovery of new CCNPs, which led to the identification of 51 putative CCNP gene clusters from public bacterial genome databases. After strain prioritization, a novel class of CCNP-type glycopeptides named kitacinnamycins, one of which showing potent activation ability towards the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) protein, was identified. Bioinformatic, genetic and biochemical analysis revealed the use of the NRPS assembly line to form the macrocyclic peptide backbone, followed by a P450 monooxygenase to generate terminal oxidized groups. A glycosyltransferase with relatively broad substrate specificity transfers sugars to the newly generated OH/COOH group. The protein crystallographic study further provided structural insights into this glycosylation. Our results not only demonstrated the feasibility of genome mining and strain prioritization for the discovery of new bioactive natural products but also disclosed the biosynthetic pathway for kitacinnamycins.	1
Title: Reassessment of the toxin profile of Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii T3 and function of putative sulfotransferases in synthesis of sulfated and sulfonated PSP toxins Abstract: The toxigenic freshwater cyanobacterium Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii T3 has been used as a model to study and elucidate the biosynthetic pathway of tetrahydropurine neurotoxins associated with paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP). There are nevertheless several inconsistencies and contradictions in the toxin profile of this strain as published by different research groups, and claimed to include carbamoyl (STX, NEO, GTX2/3), decarbamoyl (dcSTX), and N-sulfocarbamoyl (C1/2, B1) derivatives. Our analysis of the complete genome of another PSP toxin-producing cyanobacterium, Raphidiopsis brookii D9, which is closely related to C. raciborskii T3, resolved many issues regarding the correlation between biosynthetic pathways, corresponding genes and the T3 toxin profile. The putative sxt gene cluster in R. brookii D9 has a high synteny with the T3 sxt cluster, with 100% nucleotide identity among the shared genes. We also compared the PSP toxin profile of the strains by liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). In contrast to published reports, our reassessment of the PSP toxin profile of T3 confirmed production of only STX, NEO and dcNEO. We gained significant insights via correlation between specific sxt genes and their role in PSP toxin synthesis in both D9 and T3 strains. In particular, analysis of sulfotransferase functions for SxtN (N-sulfotransferase) and SxtSUL (O-sulfotransferase) enzymes allowed us to propose an extension of the PSP toxin biosynthetic pathway from STX to the production of the derivatives GTX2/3, C1/2 and B1. This is a significantly revised view of the genetic mechanisms underlying synthesis of sulfated and sulfonated STX analogues in toxigenic cyanobacteria.	1
Title: A versatile synthetic route for the preparation of titanium metal-organic frameworks Abstract: Exploitation of new titanium metal-organic frameworks (Ti-MOFs) with high crystallinity has been attracting great attention due to their vast application potential in photocatalysis. Herein a versatile synthetic strategy, namely, High Valence Metathesis and Oxidation (HVMO), is developed to synthesize a series of Ti-MOFs with predesigned topologies and structures. The crystallinity of these Ti-MOFs was well maintained throughout, as confirmed by powder X-ray diffraction and gas adsorption measurements. Significantly, there were only a few examples of Ti-MOFs, not to mention a general synthetic strategy for various kinds of Ti-MOFs in the literature. This contribution also illustrates the intriguing potential of Ti-MOF platforms in photocatalysis.	0
Title: Chain-shattering polymeric therapeutics with on-demand drug-release capability Abstract: Design of smart polymeric therapeutics:                       We designed and synthesized trigger-responsive chain-shattering polymeric therapeutics (CSPTs) via condensation polymerization of a UV-or hydrogen peroxide-responsive domain and a bisfunctional drug as co-monomers. CSPTs have precisely controlled molecular composition and unique chain-shattering type of drug release mechanism. Drug release kinetics can be precisely controlled by means of the trigger treatment. Chemotherapeutic-containing CSPTs showed trigger-responsive in vitro and in vivo antitumor efficacy.	0
Title: Fungal indole alkaloid biosynthesis: genetic and biochemical investigation of the tryptoquialanine pathway in Penicillium aethiopicum Abstract: Tremorgenic mycotoxins are a group of indole alkaloids which include the quinazoline-containing tryptoquivaline (2) that are capable of eliciting intermittent or sustained tremors in vertebrate animals. The biosynthesis of this group of bioactive compounds, which are characterized by an acetylated quinazoline ring connected to a 6-5-5 imidazoindolone ring system via a 5-membered spirolactone, has remained uncharacterized. Here, we report the identification of a gene cluster (tqa) from P. aethiopicum that is involved in the biosynthesis of tryptoquialanine (1), which is structurally similar to 2. The pathway has been confirmed to go through an intermediate common to the fumiquinazoline pathway, fumiquinazoline F, which originates from a fungal trimodular nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS). By systematically inactivating every biosynthetic gene in the cluster, followed by isolation and characterization of the intermediates, we were able to establish the biosynthetic sequence of the pathway. An unusual oxidative opening of the pyrazinone ring by an FAD-dependent berberine bridge enzyme-like oxidoreductase has been proposed based on genetic knockout studies. Notably, a 2-aminoisobutyric acid (AIB)-utilizing NRPS module has been identified and reconstituted in vitro, along with two putative enzymes of unknown functions that are involved in the synthesis of the unnatural amino acid by genetic analysis. This work provides new genetic and biochemical insights into the biosynthesis of this group of fungal alkaloids, including the tremorgens related to 2.	1
Title: Conditionally positive effect of the TetR-family transcriptional regulator AtrA on streptomycin production by Streptomyces griseus Abstract: AtrA, a transcriptional activator for actII-ORF4, encoding the pathway-specific transcriptional activator of the actinorhodin biosynthetic gene cluster in Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2), has been shown to bind the region upstream from the promoter of strR, encoding the pathway-specific transcriptional activator of the streptomycin biosynthetic gene cluster in Streptomyces griseus [Uguru et al. (2005) Mol Microbiol 58, 131-150]. The atrA orthologue (atrA-g) in S. griseus was constitutively transcribed throughout growth from a promoter located about 250 nt upstream of the translational start codon, as determined by S1 nuclease mapping. DNase I footprinting showed that histidine-tagged AtrA-g bound an inverted repeat located upstream of strR at positions -117 to -142 relative to the transcriptional start point of strR as +1. This AtrA-g-binding site was between two AdpA-binding sites at approximately nucleotide positions -270 and -50. AdpA is a central transcriptional activator in the A-factor regulatory cascade and essential for the transcription of strR. AtrA-g and AdpA simultaneously bound the respective binding sites. In contrast to AdpA, AtrA-g was non-essential for strR transcription; an atrA-g-disrupted strain produced streptomycin on routine agar media to the same extent as the wild-type strain. However, the atrA-g-disrupted strain tended to produce a smaller amount of streptomycin than the wild-type strain under some conditions, for example, on Bennett agar containing 1 % maltose and on a minimal medium. Therefore, AtrA-g had a conditionally positive effect on streptomycin production, as a tuner, probably by enhancing the AdpA-dependent transcriptional activation of strR in a still unknown manner.	1
Title: Resistance imparted by traditional Chinese medicines to the acute change of glutamic pyruvic transaminase, alkaline phosphatase and creatine kinase activities in rat blood caused by noise Abstract: The activities of serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (GPT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and creatine kinase (CK) in rats injected or not with the Chinese medicines, Astragali, Rhodiolae and Ligusticum, were determined after noise exposure. Noise at 95 and 105 dB significantly increased the activities of GPT, ALP and CK, and showed a dependence on the exposure time. The injection of each medicine significantly suppressed the increased enzyme activities by 95 and 105 dB noise.	0
Title: Tandem prenyltransferases catalyze isoprenoid elongation and complexity generation in biosynthesis of quinolone alkaloids Abstract: Modification of natural products with prenyl groups and the ensuing oxidative transformations are important for introducing structural complexity and biological activities. Penigequinolones (1) are potent insecticidal alkaloids that contain a highly modified 10-carbon prenyl group. Here we reveal an iterative prenylation mechanism for installing the 10-carbon unit using two aromatic prenyltransferases (PenI and PenG) present in the gene cluster of 1 from Penicillium thymicola. The initial Friedel-Crafts alkylation is catalyzed by PenI to yield dimethylallyl quinolone 6. The five-carbon side chain is then dehydrogenated by a flavin-dependent monooxygenase to give aryl diene 9, which serves as the electron-rich substrate for a second alkylation with dimethylallyl diphosphate to yield stryrenyl product 10. The completed, oxidized 10-carbon prenyl group then undergoes further structural morphing to yield yaequinolone C (12), the immediate precursor of 1. Our studies have therefore uncovered an unprecedented prenyl chain extension mechanism in natural product biosynthesis.	1
Title: Biosynthesis of Pseudomonas-Derived Butenolides Abstract: Butenolides are well-known signaling molecules in Gram-positive bacteria. Here, we describe a novel class of butenolides isolated from a Gram-negative Pseudomonas strain, the styrolides. Structure elucidation was aided by the total synthesis of styrolide A. Transposon mutagenesis enabled us to identify the styrolide biosynthetic gene cluster, and by using a homology search, we discovered the related and previously unknown acaterin biosynthetic gene cluster in another Pseudomonas species. Mutagenesis, heterologous expression, and identification of key shunt and intermediate products were crucial to propose a biosynthetic pathway for both Pseudomonas-derived butenolides. Comparative transcriptomics suggests a link between styrolide formation and the regulatory networks of the bacterium.	1
Title: Organohalogens Naturally Biosynthesized in Marine Environments and Produced as Disinfection Byproducts Alter Sarco/Endoplasmic Reticulum Ca2+ Dynamics Abstract: Contemporary sources of organohalogens produced as disinfection byproducts (DBPs) are receiving considerable attention as emerging pollutants because of their abundance, persistence, and potential to structurally mimic natural organohalogens produced by bacteria that serve signaling or toxicological functions in marine environments. Here, we tested 34 organohalogens from anthropogenic and marine sources to identify compounds active toward ryanodine receptor (RyR1), known toxicological targets of non-dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs). [3H]Ryanodine ([3H]Ry) binding screening (≤2 μM) identified 10 highly active organohalogens. Further analysis indicated that 2,3-dibromoindole (14), tetrabromopyrrole (31), and 2,3,5-tribromopyrrole (34) at 10 μM were the most efficacious at enhancing [3H]Ry binding. Interestingly, these congeners also inhibited microsomal sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum (SR/ER) Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA1a). Dual SERCA1a inhibition and RyR1 activation triggered Ca2+ efflux from microsomal vesicles with initial rates rank ordered 31 > 34 > 14. Hexabromobipyrroles (25) enhanced [3H]Ry binding moderately with strong SERCA1a inhibition, whereas pyrrole (24), 2,3,4-tribromopyrrole (26), and ethyl-4-bromopyrrole-2-carboxylate (27) were inactive. Of three PBDE derivatives of marine origin active in the [3H]Ry assay, 4'-hydroxy-2,3',4,5',6-pentabromodiphenyl ether (18) was also a highly potent SERCA1a inhibitor. Molecular targets of marine organohalogens that are also DBPs of emerging environmental concern are likely to contribute to their toxicity.	1
Title: Enzyme-catalyzed cationic epoxide rearrangements in quinolone alkaloid biosynthesis Abstract: Epoxides are highly useful synthons and biosynthons for the construction of complex natural products during total synthesis and biosynthesis, respectively. Among enzyme-catalyzed epoxide transformations, a reaction that is notably missing, in regard to the synthetic toolbox, is cationic rearrangement that takes place under strong acid. This is a challenging transformation for enzyme catalysis, as stabilization of the carbocation intermediate upon epoxide cleavage is required. Here, we discovered two Brønsted acid enzymes that can catalyze two unprecedented epoxide transformations in biology. PenF from the penigequinolone pathway catalyzes a cationic epoxide rearrangement under physiological conditions to generate a quaternary carbon center, while AsqO from the aspoquinolone pathway catalyzes a 3-exo-tet cyclization to forge a cyclopropane-tetrahydrofuran ring system. The discovery of these new epoxide-modifying enzymes further highlights the versatility of epoxides in complexity generation during natural product biosynthesis.	0
Title: Ketosynthase III as a gateway to engineering the biosynthesis of antitumoral benastatin derivatives Abstract: Benastatins are aromatic polyketides from Streptomyces spp. that efficiently inhibit glutathione-S-transferases and induce apoptosis. Their biosynthesis involves a type II polyketide synthase, and a ketoacyl synthase (KAS) III component (BenQ) similar to FabH that is crucial for providing and selecting the rare hexanoate PKS starter unit. The function of BenQ as a KAS III was experimentally proven by point mutation of the active site cysteine. In the mutant several novel short chain fatty acid derived penta- and hexacyclic benastatin derivatives with antiprolieferative activities are formed. Strategies for engineering benastatin biosynthesis were attempted. Synthetic starter units surrogates were not incorporated by block mutants, which suggests that the primer needs to be enzyme-bound. Thus, on the basis of KAS III crystal structures the three-dimensional structure of BenQ was modeled and the predicted substrate-binding tunnel was altered by individual mutations of potential gatekeeping residues (H95A and M99A). However, no significant changes in substrate specificity were observed, indicating that there are other or additional gatekeeping amino acid residues in BenQ or secondary factors including likely protein-protein interactions between BenQ and the PKS complex, and possible conformational changes in BenQ. Finally, a benQ null mutant was complemented with butyrate starter unit biosynthesis genes from the alnumycin biosynthesis gene cluster, which resulted in a great (10x) enhancement in the production of butyrate-primed hexacyclic benastatin derivatives. The successful generation of an alnumycin-benastatin FAS-PKS hybrid pathway highlights the potential of metabolic pathways, which may lead to novel potential therapeutics and increased yields of desired natural products.	1
Title: Cloning, sequencing and deduced functions of a cluster of Streptomyces genes probably encoding biosynthesis of the polyketide antibiotic frenolicin Abstract: A 10.2-kb fragment of DNA from Streptomyces roseofulvus, which contains polyketide synthase (PKS)-encoding genes (fren) presumed to determine production of the antibiotics frenolicin and the nanaomycins, was cloned. A 5530-bp continuous segment of this DNA was sequenced. Analysis of the sequence revealed five complete open reading frames (ORFs) transcribed in one direction (ORFs 1, 2, 3, 5, 4) and one (ORFX), located between ORF3 and ORF5, transcribed in the opposite direction. The deduced amino-acid sequences of ORFs 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 closely resemble the sequences of known components of the type-II PKS from other Streptomyces species: putative heterodimeric (ORF1 + 2) ketosynthase, acyl carrier protein, cyclase and ketoreductase, respectively. A resemblance between the N-terminal and C-terminal halves of the ORF4 product--also discovered in the corresponding genes from other isochromanequinone antibiotic producers--suggests a possible origin of the cyclase-encoding gene by duplication. ORFX appears to represent a novel class of genes of unknown function present not only in the fren cluster, but also in other clusters of aromatic antibiotic biosynthetic genes in Streptomyces species. The fren-ORF1-5 genes, encoding a PKS that constructs a nascent polyketide of either 16 or 18 carbons, compared with fixed lengths of 16 and 20 for other available examples, are proving to be valuable for understanding the mechanisms controlling polyketide chain length and patterns of reduction and cyclisation.	1
Title: A simple reverse genetics approach to elucidating the biosynthetic pathway of nocathiacin Abstract: Genomic library screening and genome mining are currently employed to identify biosynthetic gene clusters of thiopeptides. To elucidate the biosynthetic pathway of nocathiacin, we present a new approach with the application of simple reverse genetics. A relationship between structural features of thiopeptides and their biosynthetic pathways is established and is a starting point for speedily elucidating biosynthetic genes of various ribosomally-synthesized bioactive peptides with diverse modifications.	1
Title: The transgenic expression of highly inhibitory monomeric forms of phospholamban in mouse heart impairs cardiac contractility Abstract: Transgenic mice were generated with cardiac-specific overexpression of the monomeric, dominant-acting, superinhibitory L37A and I40A mutant forms of phospholamban (PLN), and their phenotypes were compared with wild-type (wt) mice or 2-fold overexpressors of wt PLN (wtOE). The level of PLN monomer in cardiac microsomes was increased 11-13-fold, and the apparent affinity of the sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase for Ca(2+) was decreased from pCa 6.22 in wt or 6.12 in wtOE to 5.81 in L37A and 5.72 in I40A. Basal physiological parameters, measured in isolated myocytes, indicated a significant reduction in the rates of shortening (+dL/dt) and relengthening (-dL/dt). Hemodynamic measurements indicated that peak systolic pressure was unaffected but that pressure changes (+dP/dt and -dP/dt) were lowered significantly in both mutant lines, and relaxation time (tau) was also lengthened significantly. Echocardiography for both mutants showed depressed systolic function and an increase in left ventricular mass of over 1.4-fold. Significant decreases in left ventricular shortening fraction and velocity of circumferential shortening and increases in ejection time were corrected by isoproterenol. The use of antibodies specific against Ser(16)- and Thr(17)-PLN peptides showed that phosphorylation of both pentameric and monomeric PLN were increased between 1.2- and 2.4-fold in both the L37A and I40A lines but not in the wtOE line. These observations show that overexpression of superinhibitory mutant forms of PLN causes depression of contractile parameters with induction of cardiac hypertrophy, as assessed with echocardiography.	0
Title: Closely related viruses of the marine picoeukaryotic alga Ostreococcus lucimarinus exhibit different ecological strategies Abstract: In marine ecosystems, viruses are major disrupters of the direct flow of carbon and nutrients to higher trophic levels. Although the genetic diversity of several eukaryotic phytoplankton virus groups has been characterized, their infection dynamics are less understood, such that the physiological and ecological implications of their diversity remain unclear. We compared genomes and infection phenotypes of the two most closely related cultured phycodnaviruses infecting the widespread picoprasinophyte Ostreococcus lucimarinus under standard- (1.3 divisions per day) and limited-light (0.41 divisions per day) nutrient replete conditions. OlV7 infection caused early arrest of the host cell cycle, coinciding with a significantly higher proportion of infected cells than OlV1-amended treatments, regardless of host growth rate. OlV7 treatments showed a near-50-fold increase of progeny virions at the higher host growth rate, contrasting with OlV1's 16-fold increase. However, production of OlV7 virions was more sensitive than OlV1 production to reduced host growth rate, suggesting fitness trade-offs between infection efficiency and resilience to host physiology. Moreover, although organic matter released from OlV1- and OlV7-infected hosts had broadly similar chemical composition, some distinct molecular signatures were observed. Collectively, these results suggest that current views on viral relatedness through marker and core gene analyses underplay operational divergence and consequences for host ecology.	0
Title: Structure and biosynthetic assembly of gulmirecins, macrolide antibiotics from the predatory bacterium Pyxidicoccus fallax Abstract: The gulmirecins constitute a new class of glycosylated macrolides that were isolated from the predatory bacterium Pyxidicoccus fallax HKI 727. Their structures were solved by a combination of NMR spectroscopic experiments and chemical derivatization. Analysis of the annotated gulmirecin gene cluster complemented the configurational assignment and provided insights into the stereochemical course of the biosynthetic assembly. The gulmirecins exhibit strong activity against staphylococci, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, but no cytotoxic effects on human cells.	1
Title: Expression and functional analysis of a gene cluster involved in the synthesis of decaprenoxanthin reveals the mechanisms for C50 carotenoid formation Abstract: Corynebacterium glutamicum accumulates the C50 carotenoid decaprenoxanthin. Rescued DNA from transposon color mutants of this Gram-positive bacterium was used to clone the carotenoid biosynthetic gene cluster. By sequence comparison and functional complementation, the genes involved in the synthesis of carotenoids with 50 carbon atoms were identified. The genes crtE, encoding a geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate synthase, crtB, encoding a phytoene synthase, and crtI, encoding a phytoene desaturase, are responsible for the formation of lycopene. The products of three novel genes, crtYe and crtYf, with sequence similarities to heterodimeric lycopene cyclase crtYc and crtYd, together with crtEb which exhibits a prenyl transferase motif, were involved in the conversion of C40 acyclic lycopene to cyclic C50 carotenoids. Using functional complementation in Escherichia coli, it could be shown that the elongation of lycopene to the acyclic C50 carotenoid flavuxanthin by the addition of C5 isoprenoid units at positions C-2 and C-2' is catalyzed by the crtEb gene product. Subsequently, the gene products of crtYe and crtYf in a concerted action convert the acyclic flavuxanthin into the cyclic C50 carotene, decaprenoxanthin, forming two epsilon-ionone groups. The mechanisms, involving two individual steps for the formation of cyclic C50 carotenoids from lycopene, are proposed on the basis of these results.	1
Title: Inactivation of Escherichia coli Cells in Aqueous Solution by Atmospheric-Pressure N2, He, Air, and O2 Microplasmas Abstract: Atmospheric-pressure N2, He, air, and O2 microplasma arrays have been used to inactivate Escherichia coli cells suspended in aqueous solution. Measurements show that the efficiency of inactivation of E. coli cells is strongly dependent on the feed gases used, the plasma treatment time, and the discharge power. Compared to atmospheric-pressure N2 and He microplasma arrays, air and O2 microplasma arrays may be utilized to more efficiently kill E. coli cells in aqueous solution. The efficiencies of inactivation of E. coli cells in water can be well described by using the chemical reaction rate model, where reactive oxygen species play a crucial role in the inactivation process. Analysis indicates that plasma-generated reactive species can react with E. coli cells in water by direct or indirect interactions.	0
Title: Ruminococcus gnavus, a member of the human gut microbiome associated with Crohn's disease, produces an inflammatory polysaccharide Abstract: A substantial and increasing number of human diseases are associated with changes in the gut microbiota, and discovering the molecules and mechanisms underlying these associations represents a major research goal. Multiple studies associate Ruminococcus gnavus, a prevalent gut microbe, with Crohn's disease, a major type of inflammatory bowel disease. We have found that R. gnavus synthesizes and secretes a complex glucorhamnan polysaccharide with a rhamnose backbone and glucose sidechains. Chemical and spectroscopic studies indicated that the glucorhamnan was largely a repeating unit of five sugars with a linear backbone formed from three rhamnose units and a short sidechain composed of two glucose units. The rhamnose backbone is made from 1,2- and 1,3-linked rhamnose units, and the sidechain has a terminal glucose linked to a 1,6-glucose. This glucorhamnan potently induces inflammatory cytokine (TNFα) secretion by dendritic cells, and TNFα secretion is dependent on toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). We also identify a putative biosynthetic gene cluster for this molecule, which has the four biosynthetic genes needed to convert glucose to rhamnose and the five glycosyl transferases needed to build the repeating pentasaccharide unit of the inflammatory glucorhamnan.	1
Title: Emulsifier of Arthrobacter RAG-1: chemical and physical properties Abstract: The extracellular emulsifier of Arthrobacter RAG-1 was deproteinized by hot phenol treatment and purified by fractional precipitation with (NH(4))(2)SO(4). The active fraction, precipitating between 30 and 35% saturation [EF-RAG(UET) WA], appeared to be homogeneous by immunodiffusion and sedimentation analysis. EF-RAG(UET) WA had an intrinsic viscosity of 750 cm(3)/g, a sedimentation constant of 6.06S, a diffusion constant of 5.25 x 10(-8) cm(2) s(-1), and a partial molar volume of 0.712 cm(3) g(-1). From these data a weight average molecular weight of 9.76 x 10(5) and a viscosity average molecular weight of 9.88 x 10(5) were calculated. EF-RAG(UET)WA contained 46.7% C, 7.01% H, and 6.06% N. Titration of the nonreducing polymer gave a single inflection point (pK' = 3.05), corresponding to 1.5 mumol of carboxyl groups per mg. Direct estimation of O-ester and hexose content of the highly acidic polymer yielded 0.65 and 0.29 mumol/mg, respectively. Mild alkaline hydrolysis released fatty acids with an average molecular weight of about 231. Strong acid hydrolysis of EF-RAG(UET)WA yielded d-glucose (minor), d-galactosamine (major), and an unidentified amino uronic acid (major).	0
Title: Eradicating Bacterial Persisters with Combinations of Strongly and Weakly Metabolism-Dependent Antibiotics Abstract: The vast majority of bactericidal antibiotics display poor efficacy against bacterial persisters, cells that are in a metabolically repressed state. Molecules that retain their bactericidal functions against such bacteria often display toxicity to human cells, which limits treatment options for infections caused by persisters. Here, we leverage insight into metabolism-dependent bactericidal antibiotic efficacy to design antibiotic combinations that sterilize both metabolically active and persister cells, while minimizing the antibiotic concentrations required. These rationally designed antibiotic combinations have the potential to improve treatments for chronic and recurrent infections.	0
Title: Two divergent Symbiodinium genomes reveal conservation of a gene cluster for sunscreen biosynthesis and recently lost genes Abstract: Background:                       The marine dinoflagellate, Symbiodinium, is a well-known photosynthetic partner for coral and other diverse, non-photosynthetic hosts in subtropical and tropical shallows, where it comprises an essential component of marine ecosystems. Using molecular phylogenetics, the genus Symbiodinium has been classified into nine major clades, A-I, and one of the reported differences among phenotypes is their capacity to synthesize mycosporine-like amino acids (MAAs), which absorb UV radiation. However, the genetic basis for this difference in synthetic capacity is unknown. To understand genetics underlying Symbiodinium diversity, we report two draft genomes, one from clade A, presumed to have been the earliest branching clade, and the other from clade C, in the terminal branch.                  Results:                       The nuclear genome of Symbiodinium clade A (SymA) has more gene families than that of clade C, with larger numbers of organelle-related genes, including mitochondrial transcription terminal factor (mTERF) and Rubisco. While clade C (SymC) has fewer gene families, it displays specific expansions of repeat domain-containing genes, such as leucine-rich repeats (LRRs) and retrovirus-related dUTPases. Interestingly, the SymA genome encodes a gene cluster for MAA biosynthesis, potentially transferred from an endosymbiotic red alga (probably of bacterial origin), while SymC has completely lost these genes.                  Conclusions:                       Our analysis demonstrates that SymC appears to have evolved by losing gene families, such as the MAA biosynthesis gene cluster. In contrast to the conservation of genes related to photosynthetic ability, the terminal clade has suffered more gene family losses than other clades, suggesting a possible adaptation to symbiosis. Overall, this study implies that Symbiodinium ecology drives acquisition and loss of gene families.	1
Title: A new Alkalitolerant Yarrowia lipolytica yeast strain is a promising model for dissecting properties and regulation of Na+ -dependent phosphate transport systems Abstract: A newly isolated osmo-, salt-, and alkalitolerant Yarrowia lipolytica yeast strain is distinguished from other yeast species by its capacity to grow vigorously at alkaline pH values (9.7), which makes it a promising model organism for studying Na+-dependent phosphate transport systems in yeasts. Phosphate uptake by Y. lipolytica cells grown at pH 9.7 was mediated by several kinetically discrete Na+-dependent systems specifically activated by Na+. One of these, a low-affinity transporter, operated at high concentrations of extracellular phosphate. The other two, high-affinity systems, maximally active in phosphate-starved cells, were repressed or derepressed depending on the prevailing extracellular phosphate concentration and pH value. The contribution of Na+/P(i)-cotransport systems to the total cellular phosphate uptake progressively increased with increasing pH, reaching its maximum at pH >/= 9.	0
Title: Genome Mining of Aspergillus hancockii Unearths Cryptic Polyketide Hancockinone A Featuring a Prenylated 6/6/6/5 Carbocyclic Skeleton Abstract: Activation of a cryptic polyketide synthase gene cluster hkn from Aspergillus hancockii via overexpression of the gene-cluster-specific transcription factor HknR led to the discovery of a novel polycyclic metabolite, which we named hancockinone A. The compound features an unprecedented prenylated 6/6/6/5 tetracarbocyclic skeleton and shows moderate antibacterial activity. Heterologous expression, substrate feeding, and in vitro assays confirmed the role of cytochrome P450 HknE in constructing the five-membered ring in hancockinone A from the precursor neosartoricin B.	1
Title: Preprosubtilisin Carlsberg processing and secretion is blocked after deletion of amino acids 97-101 in the mature part of the enzyme Abstract: During an investigation into the substrate specificity and processing of subtilisin Carlsberg from Bacillus licheniformis, two major independent findings were made: (i) as has been shown previously, a stretch of five amino acids (residues 97-101 of the mature enzyme) that loops out into the binding cleft is involved in substrate binding by subtilisin Carlsberg. In order to see whether this loop element also determines substrate specificity, the coding region for these five amino acids was deleted from the cloned gene for subtilisin Carlsberg by site-directed mutagenesis. Unexpectedly the resulting mutant preproenzyme (P42c, Mr = 42 kDa) was not processed to the mature form (Mr = 30 kDa) and was not released into the medium by a protease-deficient B. subtilis host strain; rather, it accumulated in the cell membrane. This result demonstrates that the integrity of this loop element, which is very distant from the processing cleavage sites in the preproenzyme, is required for secretion of subtilisin Carlsberg. (ii) In culture supernatants from B. subtilis harbouring the cloned wild-type subtilisin Carlsberg gene the transient appearance (at 0-3 h after onset of stationary phase) of a processing intermediate (P38c, Mr = 38 kDa) of this protease could be demonstrated. P38c very probably represents a genuine proform of subtilisin Carlsberg.	0
Title: Pore-forming activity is not sufficient for Legionella pneumophila phagosome trafficking and intracellular growth Abstract: Bacterial pathogens often subvert eukaryotic cellular processes in order to establish a replicative niche and evade host immunity. Inhibition of phagosome lysosome fusion is a strategy used by several intracellular bacteria that grow within mammalian cells. It was shown recently that Legionella pneumophila possesses a cytolytic activity that results from the insertion of pores in the macrophage membrane upon contact, and that this activity requires the dot/icm gene products, which are necessary for intracellular growth and phagosome trafficking. Other bacteria that inhibit phagosome lysosome fusion, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, demonstrate similar cytolytic activities, which suggests that formation of pores in the phagosome membrane may account for the defects observed in phagosome trafficking. In this study, we identify a new class of L. pneumophila mutant that retains the pore-forming activity found in virulent bacteria, but is defective in phagosome lysosome fusion inhibition and intracellular growth. These data indicate that cytolytic activity is not sufficient for L. pneumophila-induced alterations in phagosome trafficking. Rather, the pore may be a vehicle that facilitates delivery of bacterial-derived effector molecules to the host cell cytoplasm.	0
Title: A de novo peptide hexamer with a mutable channel Abstract: The design of new proteins that expand the repertoire of natural protein structures represents a formidable challenge. Success in this area would increase understanding of protein structure and present new scaffolds that could be exploited in biotechnology and synthetic biology. Here we describe the design, characterization and X-ray crystal structure of a new coiled-coil protein. The de novo sequence forms a stand-alone, parallel, six-helix bundle with a channel running through it. Although lined exclusively by hydrophobic leucine and isoleucine side chains, the 6-Å channel is permeable to water. One layer of leucine residues within the channel is mutable, accepting polar aspartic acid and histidine side chains, which leads to subdivision and organization of solvent within the lumen. Moreover, these mutants can be combined to form a stable and unique (Asp-His)(3) heterohexamer. These new structures provide a basis for engineering de novo proteins with new functions.	0
Title: Bioactive phenazines from an earwig-associated Streptomyces sp Abstract: Three new phenazine-type compounds, named phenazines SA-SC (1-3), together with four new natural products (4-7), were isolated from the fermentation broth of an earwig-associated Streptomyces sp. NA04227. The structures of these compounds were determined by extensive analyses of NMR, high resolution mass spectroscopic data, as well as single-crystal X-ray diffraction measurement. Sequencing and analysis of the genome data allowed us to identify the gene cluster (spz) and propose a biosynthetic pathway for these phenazine-type compounds. Additionally, compounds 1-5 exhibited moderate inhibitory activity against acetylcholinesterase (AChE), and compound 3 showed antimicrobial activities against Micrococcus luteus.	1
Title: Mechanistic understanding of Pyrococcus horikoshii Dph2, a [4Fe-4S] enzyme required for diphthamide biosynthesis Abstract: Diphthamide, the target of diphtheria toxin, is a unique posttranslational modification on eukaryotic and archaeal translation elongation factor 2 (EF2). The proposed biosynthesis of diphthamide involves three steps and we have recently found that in Pyrococcus horikoshii (P. horikoshii), the first step uses an S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM)-dependent [4Fe-4S] enzyme, PhDph2, to catalyze the formation of a C-C bond. Crystal structure shows that PhDph2 is a homodimer and each monomer contains three conserved cysteine residues that can bind a [4Fe-4S] cluster. In the reduced state, the [4Fe-4S] cluster can provide one electron to reductively cleave the bound SAM molecule. However, different from classical radical SAM family of enzymes, biochemical evidence suggest that a 3-amino-3-carboxypropyl radical is generated in PhDph2. Here we present evidence supporting that the 3-amino-3-carboxypropyl radical does not undergo hydrogen abstraction reaction, which is observed for the deoxyadenosyl radical in classical radical SAM enzymes. Instead, the 3-amino-3-carboxypropyl radical is added to the imidazole ring in the pathway towards the formation of the product. Furthermore, our data suggest that the chemistry requires only one [4Fe-4S] cluster to be present in the PhDph2 dimer.	0
Title: Biosynthetic gene cluster for the polyenoyltetramic acid alpha-lipomycin Abstract: The gram-positive bacterium Streptomyces aureofaciens Tü117 produces the acyclic polyene antibiotic alpha-lipomycin. The entire biosynthetic gene cluster (lip gene cluster) was cloned and characterized. DNA sequence analysis of a 74-kb region revealed the presence of 28 complete open reading frames (ORFs), 22 of them belonging to the biosynthetic gene cluster. Central to the cluster is a polyketide synthase locus that encodes an eight-module system comprised of four multifunctional proteins. In addition, one ORF shows homology to those for nonribosomal peptide synthetases, indicating that alpha-lipomycin belongs to the classification of hybrid peptide-polyketide natural products. Furthermore, the lip cluster includes genes responsible for the formation and attachment of d-digitoxose as well as ORFs that resemble those for putative regulatory and export functions. We generated biosynthetic mutants by insertional gene inactivation. By analysis of culture extracts of these mutants, we could prove that, indeed, the genes involved in the biosynthesis of lipomycin had been cloned, and additionally we gained insight into an unusual biosynthesis pathway.	1
Title: SPC-P1: a pathogenicity-associated prophage of Salmonella paratyphi C Abstract: Background:                       Salmonella paratyphi C is one of the few human-adapted pathogens along with S. typhi, S. paratyphi A and S. paratyphi B that cause typhoid, but it is not clear whether these bacteria cause the disease by the same or different pathogenic mechanisms. Notably, these typhoid agents have distinct sets of large genomic insertions, which may encode different pathogenicity factors. Previously we identified a novel prophage, SPC-P1, in S. paratyphi C RKS4594 and wondered whether it might be involved in pathogenicity of the bacteria.                  Results:                       We analyzed the sequence of SPC-P1 and found that it is an inducible phage with an overall G+C content of 47.24%, similar to that of most Salmonella phages such as P22 and ST64T but significantly lower than the 52.16% average of the RKS4594 chromosome. Electron microscopy showed short-tailed phage particles very similar to the lambdoid phage CUS-3. To evaluate its roles in pathogenicity, we lysogenized S. paratyphi C strain CN13/87, which did not have this prophage, and infected mice with the lysogenized CN13/87. Compared to the phage-free wild type CN13/87, the lysogenized CN13/87 exhibited significantly increased virulence and caused multi-organ damages in mice at considerably lower infection doses.                  Conclusions:                       SPC-P1 contributes pathogenicity to S. paratyphi C in animal infection models, so it is possible that this prophage is involved in typhoid pathogenesis in humans. Genetic and functional analyses of SPC-P1 may facilitate the study of pathogenic evolution of the extant typhoid agents, providing particular help in elucidating the pathogenic determinants of the typhoid agents.	0
Title: Genome mining for natural product biosynthetic gene clusters in the Subsection V cyanobacteria Abstract: Background:                       Cyanobacteria are well known for the production of a range of secondary metabolites. Whilst recent genome sequencing projects has led to an increase in the number of publically available cyanobacterial genomes, the secondary metabolite potential of many of these organisms remains elusive. Our study focused on the 11 publically available Subsection V cyanobacterial genomes, together with the draft genomes of Westiella intricata UH strain HT-29-1 and Hapalosiphon welwitschii UH strain IC-52-3, for their genetic potential to produce secondary metabolites. The Subsection V cyanobacterial genomes analysed in this study are reported to produce a diverse range of natural products, including the hapalindole-family of compounds, microcystin, hapalosin, mycosporine-like amino acids and hydrocarbons.                  Results:                       A putative gene cluster for the cyclic depsipeptide hapalosin, known to reverse P-glycoprotein multiple drug resistance, was identified within three Subsection V cyanobacterial genomes, including the producing cyanobacterium H. welwitschii UH strain IC-52-3. A number of orphan NRPS/PKS gene clusters and ribosomally-synthesised and post translationally-modified peptide gene clusters (including cyanobactin, microviridin and bacteriocin gene clusters) were identified. Furthermore, gene clusters encoding the biosynthesis of mycosporine-like amino acids, scytonemin, hydrocarbons and terpenes were also identified and compared.                  Conclusions:                       Genome mining has revealed the diversity, abundance and complex nature of the secondary metabolite potential of the Subsection V cyanobacteria. This bioinformatic study has identified novel biosynthetic enzymes which have not been associated with gene clusters of known classes of natural products, suggesting that these cyanobacteria potentially produce structurally novel secondary metabolites.	1
Title: Host-dependent heterologous expression of berninamycin gene cluster leads to linear thiopeptide antibiotics Abstract: Berninamycins are a class of thiopeptide antibiotics with potent activity against Gram-positive bacteria. Heterologous expression of the berninamycin (ber) biosynthetic gene cluster from marine-derived Streptomyces sp. SCSIO 11878 in different terrestrial model Streptomyces hosts led to the production of berninamycins A (1) and B (2) in Streptomyces lividans SBT18 and Streptomyces coelicolor M1154, while two new linearized berninamycins J (3) and K (4) were obtained in Streptomyces albus J1074. Their structures were elucidated by detailed interpretation of NMR data and Marfey's method. Bioactivity assays showed that the linear thiopeptides 3 and 4 were less potent than 1 and 2 in antibacterial activity. This work indicates that undefined host-dependent enzymes might be responsible for generating the linear thiopeptides 3 and 4 in S. albus J1074.	1
Title: Bisucaberin B, a linear hydroxamate class siderophore from the marine bacterium Tenacibaculum mesophilum Abstract: A siderophore, named bisucaberin B, was isolated from Tenacibaculum mesophilum bacteria separated from a marine sponge collected in the Republic of Palau. Using spectroscopic and chemical methods, the structure of bisucaberin B (1) was clearly determined to be a linear dimeric hydroxamate class siderophore. Although compound 1 is an open form of the known macrocyclic dimer bisucaberin (2), and was previously described as a bacterial degradation product of desferrioxamine B (4), the present report is the first description of the de novo biosynthesis of 1. To the best of our knowledge, compound 1 is the first chemically characterized siderophore isolated from a bacterium belonging to the phylum Bacteroidetes.	1
Title: PDZ-Reactive Peptide Activates Ephrin-B Reverse Signaling and Inhibits Neuronal Chemotaxis Abstract: Intracellular reactions on nonenzymatic proteins that activate cellular signals are rarely found. We report one example here that a designed peptide derivative undergoes a nucleophilic reaction specifically with a cytosolic PDZ protein inside cells. This reaction led to the activation of ephrin-B reverse signaling, which subsequently inhibited SDF-1 induced neuronal chemotaxis of human neuroblastoma cells and mouse cerebellar granule neurons. Our work provides direct evidence that PDZ-RGS3 bridges ephrin-B reverse signaling and SDF-1 induced G protein signaling for the first time.	0
Title: Five-membered cyclic metal carbyne: synthesis of osmapentalynes by the reactions of osmapentalene with allene, alkyne, and alkene Abstract: The synthesis of small cyclic metal carbynes is challenging due to the large angle strain associated with the highly distorted nonlinear triple bonds. Herein, we report a general route for the synthesis of five-membered cyclic metal carbyne complexes, osmapentalynes, by the reactions of an osmapentalene derivative with allene, alkyne, and alkene. Experimental observations and theoretical calculations document the aromaticity in the fused five-membered rings of osmapentalynes. The realization of transforming osmapentalene to osmapentalyne through this general route would not only allow further exploration of metallapentalyne chemistry but also show promising applications of this novel aromatic system with broad absorption band and high molar absorption coefficient.	0

Title: Reverse β-oxidation pathways for efficient chemical production Abstract: Microbial production of fuels, chemicals, and materials has the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and contribute to a sustainable bioeconomy. While synthetic biology allows readjusting of native metabolic pathways for the synthesis of desired products, often these native pathways do not support maximum efficiency and are affected by complex regulatory mechanisms. A synthetic or engineered pathway that allows modular synthesis of versatile bioproducts with minimal enzyme requirement and regulation while achieving high carbon and energy efficiency could be an alternative solution to address these issues. The reverse β-oxidation (rBOX) pathways enable iterative non-decarboxylative elongation of carbon molecules of varying chain lengths and functional groups with only four core enzymes and no ATP requirement. Here, we describe recent developments in rBOX pathway engineering to produce alcohols and carboxylic acids with diverse functional groups, along with other commercially important molecules such as polyketides. We discuss the application of rBOX beyond the pathway itself by its interfacing with various carbon-utilization pathways and deployment in different organisms, which allows feedstock diversification from sugars to glycerol, carbon dioxide, methane, and other substrates.	0
Title: Biosynthesis of the antitumor chromomycin A3 in Streptomyces griseus: analysis of the gene cluster and rational design of novel chromomycin analogs Abstract: The biosynthetic gene cluster of the aureolic acid type antitumor drug chromomycin A3 from S. griseus subsp. griseus has been identified and characterized. It spans 43 kb and contains 36 genes involved in polyketide biosynthesis and modification, deoxysugar biosynthesis and sugar transfer, pathway regulation and resistance. The organization of the cluster clearly differs from that of the closely related mithramycin. Involvement of the cluster in chromomycin A3 biosynthesis was demonstrated by disrupting the cmmWI gene encoding a polyketide reductase involved in side chain reduction. Three novel chromomycin derivatives were obtained, named chromomycin SK, chromomycin SA, and chromomycin SDK, which show antitumor activity and differ with respect to their 3-side chains. A pathway for the biosynthesis of chromomycin A3 and its deoxysugars is proposed.	1
Title: Isolation, Structure Elucidation, and Biosynthesis of a Cysteate-Containing Nonribosomal Peptide in Streptomyces lincolnensis Abstract: The species Streptomyces lincolnensis is known as a producer of lincomycin A, a clinically important lincosamide antibiotic with activity against Gram-positive bacteria. Here, we report that S. lincolnensis produces a new cysteate-containing lactone product, cysteoamide (1), which arises from nonribosomal peptide synthetase-programmed sequential assembly of the monomers phenylacetic acid, valine, cysteate, threonine, β-hydroxyleucine, and β-alanine and subsequent intramolecular cyclization to form a lactone ring. The structure of 1 was determined by combined analysis of NMR and MS spectra, while the amino acid absolute configurations in 1 were assigned by Marfey's analysis following acid hydrolysis. The biosynthetic gene cluster of 1 was defined in the genome of S. lincolnensis by bioinformatics analysis and in vivo genetic study. In addition, in vitro assay revealed that OrfA, a pyridoxal 5'-phosphate-dependent protein, is responsible for the formation of the unusual cysteate unit. Cysteate-containing nonribosomal peptides appear to be widely present in various Streptomyces strains, and this study generates interest in their intrinsic functions that remain poorly understood.	1
Title: Cooperative Involvement of Glycosyltransferases in the Transfer of Amino Sugars during the Biosynthesis of the Macrolactam Sipanmycin by Streptomyces sp. Strain CS149 Abstract: Macrolactams comprise a family of natural compounds with important bioactivities, such as antibiotic, antifungal, and antiproliferative activities. Sipanmycins A and B are two novel members of this family, with two sugar moieties attached to the aglycon. In the related macrolactam vicenistatin, the sugar moiety has been proven to be essential for cytotoxicity. In this work, the gene cluster responsible for the biosynthesis of sipanmycins (sip cluster) in Streptomyces sp. strain CS149 is described and the steps involved in the glycosylation of the final compounds unraveled. Also, the cooperation of two different glycosyltransferases in each glycosylation step is demonstrated. Additionally, the essential role of SipO2 as an auxiliary protein in the incorporation of the second deoxy sugar is addressed. In light of the results obtained by the generation of mutant strains and in silico characterization of the sip cluster, a biosynthetic pathway for sipanmycins and the two deoxy sugars attached is proposed. Finally, the importance of the hydroxyl group at C-10 of the macrolactam ring and the sugar moieties for cytotoxicity and antibiotic activity of sipanmycins is shown.IMPORTANCE The rapid emergence of infectious diseases and multiresistant pathogens has increased the necessity for new bioactive compounds; thus, novel strategies have to be developed to find them. Actinomycetes isolated in symbiosis with insects have attracted attention in recent years as producers of metabolites with important bioactivities. Sipanmycins are glycosylated macrolactams produced by Streptomyces sp. CS149, isolated from leaf-cutting ants, and show potent cytotoxic activity. Here, we characterize the sip cluster and propose a biosynthetic pathway for sipanmycins. As far as we know, it is the first time that the cooperation between two different glycosyltransferases is demonstrated to be strictly necessary for the incorporation of the same sugar. Also, a third protein with homology to P450 monooxygenases, SipO2, is shown to be essential in the second glycosylation step, forming a complex with the glycosyltransferase pair SipS9-SipS14.	1
Title: The N-terminus of the Begomovirus nuclear shuttle protein (BV1) determines virulence or avirulence in Phaseolus vulgaris Abstract: The BV1 gene of the bipartite Begomovirus genome encodes a nuclear shuttle protein (NSP) that is also an avirulence determinant in common bean. The function of the NSP of two common bean-infecting bipartite begomoviruses, Bean dwarf mosaic virus (BDMV) and Bean golden yellow mosaic virus (BGYMV), was investigated using a series of hybrid DNA-B components expressing chimeric BDMV and BGYMV NSP, and genotypes of the two major common bean gene pools: Andean (cv. Topcrop) and Middle American (cvs. Alpine and UI 114). BDMV DNA-A coinoculated with HBDBG4 (BDMV DNA-B expressing the BGYMV NSP) and HBDBG9 (BDMV DNA-B expressing a chimeric NSP with the N-terminal 1 to 42 amino acids from BGYMV) overcame the BDMV resistance of UI 114. This established that the BDMV NSP is an avirulence determinant in UI 114, and mapped the domain involved in this response to the N-terminus, which is a variable surface-exposed region. BDMV DNA-A coinoculated with HBDBG10, expressing a chimeric NSP with amino acids 43 to 92 from BGYMV, was not infectious, revealing an essential virus-specific domain. In the BGYMV background, the BDMV NSP was a virulence factor in the Andean cv. Topcrop, whereas it was an avirulence factor in the Middle American cultivars, particularly in the absence of the BGYMV NSP. The capsid protein (CP) also played a gene pool-specific role in viral infectivity; it was dispensable for infectivity in the Andean cv. Topcrop, but was required for infectivity of BDMV, BGYMV, and certain hybrid viruses in the Middle American cultivars. Redundancy of the CP and NSP, which are nuclear proteins involved directly or indirectly in viral movement, provides a masking effect that may allow the virus to avoid host defense responses.	0
Title: Predicting Transcriptional Output of Synthetic Multi-input Promoters Abstract: Recent advances in synthetic biology have led to a wealth of well-characterized genetic parts. As parts libraries grow, so too does the potential to create novel multi-input promoters that integrate disparate signals to determine transcriptional output. Our ability to construct such promoters will outpace our ability to characterize promoter performance, due to the vast number of input combinations. In this study, we examine the input-output relations of recently developed synthetic multi-input promoters and describe two methods for predicting their behavior. The first method uses 1-dimensional induction data obtained from experiments on single-input systems to predict the n-dimensional induction responses of systems with n inputs. We demonstrate that this approach accurately predicts Boolean (on/off) responses of multi-input systems consisting of novel chimeric transcription factors and hybrid promoters in Escherichia coli. The second method uses only a small amount of multi-input response data to accurately predict analog system response over the entire landscape of input combinations. Taken together, these methods facilitate the design of synthetic circuits that utilize multi-input promoters.	0
Title: Conidiophore stalk-less1 encodes a putative zinc-finger protein involved in the early stage of conidiation and mycelial infection in Magnaporthe oryzae Abstract: Over recent decades, many pathogenicity genes of Magnaporthe oryzae have been identified but only a very limited number of genes have been identified that encode components of the conidiogenesis pathway. We report here a T-DNA insertional mutant that completely lost conidiation ability. Further investigation revealed that this mutant did not develop any conidiophore, and that the T-DNA was integrated into an annotated gene designated as conidiophore stalk-less1 or COS1. Complementation experiments suggested that COS1 may be a determinant of conidiation. Sequence analysis revealed that COS1 putatively encodes a 491-amino-acid zinc-finger protein and the protein was revealed localized to nucleus. Reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-based expression analysis indicated that two homologues of conidiophore-related genes were affected by the cos1 mutation, suggesting that Cos1 may function as a transcriptional regulator controlling genes responsible for conidiation. Inoculations of rice roots and wounded leaves with mycelia suggested that COS1 is not required for pathogenicity. Moreover, mutation of COS1 may aggravate infection of wounded leaves. Interestingly, different from the wild-type strain, mycelia of the cos1 mutant successfully infected host cells and caused visible symptoms on unwounded leaf blades and sheaths, indicating that Cos1 may have a role in some unknown mechanism of mycelial infection of M. oryzae.	0
Title: Analysis of eryBI, eryBIII and eryBVII from the erythromycin biosynthetic gene cluster in Saccharopolyspora erythraea Abstract: The gene cluster (ery) governing the biosynthesis of the macrolide antibiotic erythromycin A by Saccharopolyspora erythraea contains, in addition to the eryA genes encoding the polyketide synthase, two regions containing genes for later steps in the pathway. The region 5' of eryA that lies between the known genes ermE (encoding the erythromycin resistance methyltransferase) and eryBIII (encoding a putative S-adenosylmethionine-dependent methyltransferase), and that contains the gene eryBI (orf2), has now been sequenced. The inferred product of the eryBI gene shows striking sequence similarity to authentic beta-glucosidases. Specific mutants were created in eryBI, and the resulting strains were found to synthesise erythromycin A, showing that this gene, despite its position in the biosynthetic gene cluster, is not essential for erythromycin biosynthesis. A mutant in eryBIII and a double mutant in eryBI and eryBIII were obtained and the analysis of novel erythromycins produced by these strains confirmed the proposed function of EryBIII as a C-methyltransferase. Also, a chromosomal mutant was constructed for the previously sequenced ORF19 and shown to accumulate erythronolide B, as expected for an eryB mutant and consistent with its proposed role as an epimerase in dTDP-mycarose biosynthesis.	1
Title: The gene cluster for fluorometabolite biosynthesis in Streptomyces cattleya: a thioesterase confers resistance to fluoroacetyl-coenzyme A Abstract: A genomic library of Streptomyces cattleya was screened to isolate a gene cluster encoding enzymes responsible for the production of fluorine-containing metabolites. In addition to the previously described fluorinase FlA which catalyzes the formation of 5'-fluoro-5'-deoxyadenosine from S-adenosylmethionine and fluoride, 11 other putative open reading frames have been identified. Three of the proteins encoded by these genes have been characterized. FlB was determined to be the second enzyme in the pathway, catalyzing the phosphorolytic cleavage of 5'-fluoro-5'-deoxyadenosine to produce 5-fluoro-5-deoxy-D-ribose-1-phosphate. The enzyme FlI was found to be an S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase, which may act to relieve S-adenosylhomocysteine inhibition of the fluorinase. Finally, flK encodes a thioesterase which catalyzes the selective breakdown of fluoroacetyl-CoA but not acetyl-CoA, suggesting that it provides the producing strain with a mechanism for resistance to fluoroacetate.	1
Title: Modulation of the ligand-field anisotropy in a series of ferric low-spin cytochrome c mutants derived from Pseudomonas aeruginosa cytochrome c-551 and Nitrosomonas europaea cytochrome c-552: a nuclear magnetic resonance and electron paramagnetic resonance study Abstract: Cytochromes of the c type with histidine-methionine (His-Met) heme axial ligation play important roles in electron-transfer reactions and in enzymes. In this work, two series of cytochrome c mutants derived from Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa c-551) and from the ammonia-oxidizing bacterium Nitrosomonas europaea (Ne c-552) were engineered and overexpressed. In these proteins, point mutations were induced in a key residue (Asn64) near the Met axial ligand; these mutations have a considerable impact both on heme ligand-field strength and on the Met orientation and dynamics (fluxionality), as judged by low-temperature electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra. Ne c-552 has a ferric low-spin (S = 1/2) EPR signal characterized by large g anisotropy with g(max) resonance at 3.34; a similar large g(max) value EPR signal is found in the mitochondrial complex III cytochrome c1. In Ne c-552, deletion of Asn64 (NeN64Delta) changes the heme ligand field from more axial to rhombic (small g anisotropy and g(max) at 3.13) and furthermore hinders the Met fluxionality present in the wild-type protein. In Pa c-551 (g(max) at 3.20), replacement of Asn64 with valine (PaN64V) induces a decrease in the axial strain (g(max) at 3.05) and changes the Met configuration. Another set of mutants prepared by insertion (ins) and/or deletion (Delta) of a valine residue adjacent to Asn64, resulting in modifications in the length of the axial Met-donating loop (NeV65Delta, NeG50N/V65Delta, PaN50G/V65ins), did not result in appreciable alterations of the originally weak (Ne c-552) or very weak (Pa c-551) axial field but had an impact on Met orientation, fluxionality, and relaxation dynamics. Comparison of the electronic fingerprints in the overexpressed proteins and their mutants reveals a linear relationship between axial strain and average paramagnetic heme methyl shifts, irrespective of Met orientation or dynamics. Thus, for these His-Met axially coordinated Fe(III), the large g(max) value EPR signal does not represent a special case as is observed for bis-His axially coordinated Fe(III) with the two His planes perpendicular to each other.	0
Title: A Remarkable Difference That One Fluorine Atom Confers on the Mechanisms of Inactivation of Human Ornithine Aminotransferase by Two Cyclohexene Analogues of γ-Aminobutyric Acid Abstract: Human ornithine aminotransferase (hOAT), a pyridoxal 5'-phosphate-dependent enzyme, plays a critical role in the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Pharmacological selective inhibition of hOAT has been shown to be a potential therapeutic approach for HCC. Inspired by the discovery of the nonselective aminotransferase inactivator (1R,3S,4S)-3-amino-4-fluoro cyclopentane-1-carboxylic acid (1), in this work, we rationally designed, synthesized, and evaluated a novel series of fluorine-substituted cyclohexene analogues, thereby identifying 8 and 9 as novel selective hOAT time-dependent inhibitors. Intact protein mass spectrometry and protein crystallography demonstrated 8 and 9 as covalent inhibitors of hOAT, which exhibit two distinct inactivation mechanisms resulting from the difference of a single fluorine atom. Interestingly, they share a similar turnover mechanism, according to the mass spectrometry-based analysis of metabolites and fluoride ion release experiments. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and electrostatic potential (ESP) charge calculations were conducted, which elucidated the significant influence of the one-fluorine difference on the corresponding intermediates, leading to two totally different inactivation pathways. The novel addition-aromatization inactivation mechanism for 9 contributes to its significantly enhanced potency, along with excellent selectivity over other aminotransferases.	0
Title: Characterization of E. coli O24 and O56 O antigen gene clusters reveals a complex evolutionary history of the O24 gene cluster Abstract: O antigen is part of the lipopolysaccharide present in the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria. It has many different forms, which are almost entirely due to genetic variations of O antigen gene clusters. In this study, the O antigen gene clusters of E. coli O24 and O56 were sequenced, and all genes were assigned functions on the basis of homology. Comparison of O antigen gene clusters indicated that E. coli O24 O antigen gene cluster has possibly arisen from the E. coli O56 gene cluster, through inactivation of two glycosyltransferase genes and acquisition of two new genes from E. coli O157 and O152, respectively. The insertion sequence elements seemed to play important roles for the assembly of the O24 O antigen gene cluster. This is the first time that the evolutionary history of a multi-origin O antigen gene cluster is clearly demonstrated. Genes specific to E. coli O24 and O56 were also identified, which may be used for development of DNA-based serotyping schemes.	1
Title: Efficient extracellular production of recombinant proteins in E. coli via enhancing expression of dacA on the genome Abstract: D, D-carboxypeptidase DacA plays an important role in the synthesis and stabilization of Escherichia coli cell wall peptidoglycan. The production level of extracellular recombinant proteins in E. coli can be enhanced by high D, D-carboxypeptidase activity. Construction of expression systems under optimal promoters is one of the main strategies to realize high protein production in E. coli. In this study, the promoter PdacA-3 from DacA on the genome of E. coli BL21 (DE3) was verified to be efficient for recombinant green fluorescent protein using the plasmid mutant pET28a-PdacA with PdacA-3. Meanwhile, the promoter PdacA-3 was engineered to increase the production level of proteins via inserting one or two Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequences between the promoter PdacA-3 and the target genes. The expression level of dacA on the genome was increased by the improved transcription of the engineered promoters (especially after inserting one additional SD sequence). The engineered promoters increased cell membrane permeabilities to significantly enhance the secretion production of extracellular recombinant proteins in E. coli. Among them, the extracellular recombinant amylase activities in E. coli BL21::1SD-pET28a-amyK and E. coli BL21::2SD-pET28a-amyK were increased by 2.0- and 1.6-fold that of the control (E. coli BL21-pET28a-amyK), respectively. Promoter engineering also affected the morphology and growth of the E. coli mutants. It was indicated that the engineered promoters enhanced the expression of dacA on the genome to disturb the synthesis and structural stability of cell wall peptidoglycans.	0
Title: Molecular genetic characterization of the thermostable L-lactate dehydrogenase gene (ldhL) of Thermoanaerobacter ethanolicus JW200 and biochemical characterization of the enzyme Abstract: The structural gene ldhL for a thermostable L-(+)-lactate dehydrogenase was cloned from Thermoanaerobacter ethanolicus JW200. The nucleotide sequence of the ldhL gene was determined and shown to have the capacity to encode a protein of 311 amino acids (33.5 kDa). By 5'-RACE analysis, the ldhL transcription start point was confirmed to be derived from the -10 region closest to the initiation codon. The enzyme was overexpressed in Escherichia coli and purified to homogeneity by nickel-affinity chromatography. It was shown to be allosteric in the presence of fructose-1,6-bisphosphate. The optimum pH and temperature for the enzyme were 5.8 and 60 degrees capital ES, Cyrillic in the pyruvate reduction and 7.0 and 70 degrees capital ES, Cyrillic in the lactate oxidation reaction, respectively. The kinetic parameters K(m,app) and k(cat,app) for pyruvate were 0.18 mM and 520 U/mg, respectively, and in the absence of fructose-1,6-bisphosphate, a 1.2-fold increase in K(m,app) and a 16-fold decrease in k(cat,app) were determined. The K(m,app) and k(cat,app) values for lactate were 60 mM and 0.58 U/mg, respectively, and they were not affected by fructose-1,6-bisphosphate. The enzyme was greatly inhibited by Zn2+, Ag(+), Cu2+, Fe3+, and Pb(3+). The extreme thermostability of the enzyme was reflected in its unaltered activity over 5 h at 70 degrees C.	0
Title: Molecular mechanism for loss of nodulation properties of Rhizobium trifolii Abstract: Of 18 Rhizobium trifolii strains tested, 12 showed a high frequency of loss of nodulation ability after incubation in cultures at elevated temperatures. A correlation between loss of nodulation ability and loss of a large plasmid was demonstrated for R. trifolii. In some nonnodulating (Nod-) mutants, deletions occurred instead of total elimination of the plasmid molecule. The maximum curing effect was observed in bacteria incubated at 35 degrees C. After 4 or more days of incubation at this temperature, the viability of bacteria decreased markedly, and the number of nonnodulating mutants increased significantly. At the elevated temperature DNA synthesis was stopped completely after 2 h, whereas protein synthesis proceeded for a few days. Microscopic observations showed that during the first 3 days of incubation at the elevated temperature, the bacterial cells increased markedly in size. These large irregular cells then divided and produced Nod- clones. Nonnodulating clones did not result from the selection of temperature-resistant mutants. The presence of P-group plasmids in Rhizobium strains strongly inhibited the loss of nodulation ability during incubation at 35 degrees C. The observed phenomenon did not result from integrative suppression. It is possible that a product(s) of the genes of R-plasmids acts as a stabilizing agent on the replication process of the indigenous Rhizobium plasmids.	0
Title: Biosynthesis of antimycins with a reconstituted 3-formamidosalicylate pharmacophore in Escherichia coli Abstract: Antimycins are a family of natural products generated from a hybrid nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS)-polyketide synthase (PKS) assembly line. Although they possess an array of useful biological activities, their structural complexity makes chemical synthesis challenging, and their biosynthesis has thus far been dependent on slow-growing source organisms. Here, we reconstituted the biosynthesis of antimycins in Escherichia coli, a versatile host that is robust and easy to manipulate genetically. Along with Streptomyces genetic studies, the heterologous expression of different combinations of ant genes enabled us to systematically confirm the functions of the modification enzymes, AntHIJKL and AntO, in the biosynthesis of the 3-formamidosalicylate pharmacophore of antimycins. Our E. coli-based antimycin production system can not only be used to engineer the increased production of these bioactive compounds, but it also paves the way for the facile generation of novel and diverse antimycin analogues through combinatorial biosynthesis.	1
Title: Osmotically regulated synthesis of the compatible solute ectoine in Bacillus pasteurii and related Bacillus spp Abstract: By using natural-abundance (13)C-nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis we have investigated the types of compatible solutes that are synthesized de novo in a variety of Bacillus species under high-osmolality growth conditions. Five different patterns of compatible solute production were found among the 13 Bacillus species we studied. Bacillus subtilis, B. licheniformis, and B. megaterium produced proline; B. cereus, B. circulans, B. thuringiensis, Paenibacillus polymyxa, and Aneurinibacillus aneurinilyticus synthesized glutamate; B. alcalophilus, B. psychrophilus, and B. pasteurii synthesized ectoine; and Salibacillus (formerly Bacillus) salexigens produced both ectoine and hydroxyectoine, whereas Virgibacillus (formerly Bacillus) pantothenticus synthesized both ectoine and proline. Hence, the ability to produce the tetrahydropyrimidine ectoine under hyperosmotic growth conditions is widespread within the genus Bacillus and closely related taxa. To study ectoine biosynthesis within the group of Bacillus species in greater detail, we focused on B. pasteurii. We cloned and sequenced its ectoine biosynthetic genes (ectABC). The ectABC genes encode the diaminobutyric acid acetyltransferase (EctA), the diaminobutyric acid aminotransferase (EctB), and the ectoine synthase (EctC). Together these proteins constitute the ectoine biosynthetic pathway, and their heterologous expression in B. subtilis led to the production of ectoine. Northern blot analysis demonstrated that the ectABC genes are genetically organized as an operon whose expression is strongly enhanced when the osmolality of the growth medium is raised. Primer extension analysis allowed us to pinpoint the osmoregulated promoter of the B. pasteurii ectABC gene cluster. HPLC analysis of osmotically challenged B. pasteurii cells revealed that ectoine production within this bacterium is finely tuned and closely correlated with the osmolality of the growth medium. These observations together with the osmotic control of ectABC transcription suggest that the de novo synthesis of ectoine is an important facet in the cellular adaptation of B. pasteurii to high-osmolarity surroundings.	1
Title: Structure and mechanism of ORF36, an amino sugar oxidizing enzyme in everninomicin biosynthesis Abstract: Everninomicin is a highly modified octasaccharide that belongs to the orthosomycin family of antibiotics and possesses potent Gram-positive antibiotic activity, including broad-spectrum efficacy against multidrug resistant enterococci and Staphylococcus aureus. Among its distinctive structural features is a nitro sugar, l-evernitrose, analogues of which decorate a variety of natural products. Recently, we identified a nitrososynthase enzyme encoded by orf36 from Micromonospora carbonacea var. africana that mediates the flavin-dependent double oxidation of synthetically generated thymidine diphosphate (TDP)-l-epi-vancosamine to the corresponding nitroso sugar. Herein, we utilize a five-enzyme in vitro pathway both to verify that ORF36 catalyzes oxidation of biogenic TDP-l-epi-vancosamine and to determine whether ORF36 exhibits catalytic competence for any of its biosynthetic progenitors, which are candidate substrates for nitrososynthases in vivo. Progenitors solely undergo single-oxidation reactions and terminate in the hydroxylamine oxidation state. Performing the in vitro reactions in the presence of (18)O(2) establishes that molecular oxygen, rather than oxygen from water, is incorporated into ORF36-generated intermediates and products and identifies an off-pathway product that correlates with the oxidation product of a progenitor substrate. The 3.15 Å resolution X-ray crystal structure of ORF36 reveals a tetrameric enzyme that shares a fold with acyl-CoA dehydrogenases and class D flavin-containing monooxygenases, including the nitrososynthase KijD3. However, ORF36 and KijD3 have unusually open active sites in comparison to these related enzymes. Taken together, these studies map substrate determinants and allow the proposal of a minimal monooxygenase mechanism for amino sugar oxidation by ORF36.	1
Title: Characterization of CYP76AH4 clarifies phenolic diterpenoid biosynthesis in the Lamiaceae Abstract: Miltiradiene (1) is the precursor of phenolic diterpenoids such as ferruginol (2), requiring aromatization and hydroxylation. While this has been attributed to a single cytochrome P450 (CYP76AH1), characterization of the rosemary ortholog CYP76AH4 led to the discovery that these CYPs simply hydroxylate the facilely oxidized aromatic intermediate abietatriene (3).	0
Title: Chain initiation in the leinamycin-producing hybrid nonribosomal peptide/polyketide synthetase from Streptomyces atroolivaceus S-140. Discrete, monofunctional adenylation enzyme and peptidyl carrier protein that directly load D-alanine Abstract: Nonribosomal peptide natural products are biosynthesized from amino acid precursors by nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs), which are organized into modules. For a typical NRPS initiation module, an adenylation (A) domain activates an amino acid and installs it onto a peptidyl carrier protein (PCP) domain as a thioester; an elongation module, which has a condensation (C) domain located between every consecutive pair of A and PCP domains, catalyzes the formation of the peptide bond between the upstream aminoacyl/peptidyl-S-PCP and the free amino group of the downstream aminoacyl-S-PCP. D-amino acid constituents in peptide natural products usually arise from the L-enantiomers through the action of integral epimerization (E) domains of an NRPS. The biosynthetic gene cluster for leinamycin, a hybrid nonribosomal peptide/polyketide containing a D-alanine moiety, does not encode a typical NRPS initiation module with the expected A-PCP-E domains; instead, it has only an A protein (LnmQ) and a PCP (LnmP), both of which are encoded by separate genes. Here we show the results of biochemical experiments as follows: (i) we demonstrate that LnmQ directly activates D-alanine as D-alaninyl-AMP and installs it onto LnmP to generate a D-alaninyl-S-PCP intermediate; (ii) we confirm that aminoacylation of LnmP by LnmQ in trans is the result of specific communication between the separate A and PCP proteins; and (iii) we reveal that leinamycin production can be improved by supplementation of exogenous D-alanine in the fermentation broth of Streptomyces atroolivaceous S-140. These findings unveil an unprecedented NRPS initiation module structure that is characterized by a discrete D-alanine-specific A protein and a PCP.	1
Title: Molecular characterization of the PR-toxin gene cluster in Penicillium roqueforti and Penicillium chrysogenum: cross talk of secondary metabolite pathways Abstract: The PR-toxin is a potent mycotoxin produced by Penicillium roqueforti in moulded grains and grass silages and may contaminate blue-veined cheese. The PR-toxin derives from the 15 carbon atoms sesquiterpene aristolochene formed by the aristolochene synthase (encoded by ari1). We have cloned and sequenced a four gene cluster that includes the ari1 gene from P. roqueforti. Gene silencing of each of the four genes (named prx1 to prx4) resulted in a reduction of 65-75% in the production of PR-toxin indicating that the four genes encode enzymes involved in PR-toxin biosynthesis. Interestingly the four silenced mutants overproduce large amounts of mycophenolic acid, an antitumor compound formed by an unrelated pathway suggesting a cross-talk of PR-toxin and mycophenolic acid production. An eleven gene cluster that includes the above mentioned four prx genes and a 14-TMS drug/H(+) antiporter was found in the genome of Penicillium chrysogenum. This eleven gene cluster has been reported to be very poorly expressed in a transcriptomic study of P. chrysogenum genes under conditions of penicillin production (strongly aerated cultures). We found that this apparently silent gene cluster is able to produce PR-toxin in P. chrysogenum under static culture conditions on hydrated rice medium. Noteworthily, the production of PR-toxin was 2.6-fold higher in P. chrysogenum npe10, a strain deleted in the 56.8kb amplifiable region containing the pen gene cluster, than in the parental strain Wisconsin 54-1255 providing another example of cross-talk between secondary metabolite pathways in this fungus. A detailed PR-toxin biosynthesis pathway is proposed based on all available evidence.	1
Title: Structural basis for high-affinity peptide inhibition of human Pin1 Abstract: Human Pin1 is a key regulator of cell-cycle progression and plays growth-promoting roles in human cancers. High-affinity inhibitors of Pin1 may provide a unique opportunity for disrupting oncogenic pathways. Here we report two high-resolution X-ray crystal structures of human Pin1 bound to non-natural peptide inhibitors. The structures of the bound high-affinity peptides identify a type-I beta-turn conformation for Pin1 prolyl peptide isomerase domain-peptide binding and an extensive molecular interface for high-affinity recognition. Moreover, these structures suggest chemical elements that may further improve the affinity and pharmacological properties of future peptide-based Pin inhibitors. Finally, an intramolecular hydrogen bond observed in both peptide complexes mimics the cyclic conformation of FK506 and rapamycin. Both FK506 and rapamycin are clinically important inhibitors of other peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerases. This comparative discovery suggests that a cyclic peptide polyketide bridge, like that found in FK506 and rapamycin or a similar linkage, may significantly improve the binding affinity of structure-based Pin1 inhibitors.	0
Title: Heterologous Expression of a Cryptic Gene Cluster from Streptomyces leeuwenhoekii C34T Yields a Novel Lasso Peptide, Leepeptin Abstract: Analysis of the genome sequence of Streptomyces leeuwenhoekii C34T identified biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) for three different lasso peptides (Lp1, Lp2, and Lp3) which were not known to be made by the strain. Lasso peptides represent relatively new members of the RiPP (ribosomally synthesized and posttranslationally modified peptides) family of natural products and have not been extensively studied. Lp3, whose production could be detected in culture supernatants from S. leeuwenhoekii C34T and after heterologous expression of its BGC in Streptomyces coelicolor, is identical to the previously characterized chaxapeptin. Lp1, whose production could not be detected or achieved heterologously, appears to be identical to a recently identified member of the citrulassin family of lasso peptides. Since production of Lp2 by S. leeuwenhoekii C34T was not observed, its BGC was also expressed in S. coelicolor The lasso peptide was isolated and its structure confirmed by mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance analyses, revealing a novel structure that appears to represent a new family of lasso peptides.IMPORTANCE Recent developments in genome sequencing combined with bioinformatic analysis have revealed that actinomycetes contain a plethora of unexpected BGCs and thus have the potential to produce many more natural products than previously thought. This reflects the inability to detect the production of these compounds under laboratory conditions, perhaps through the use of inappropriate growth media or the absence of the environmental cues required to elicit expression of the corresponding BGCs. One approach to overcoming this problem is to circumvent the regulatory mechanisms that control expression of the BGC in its natural host by deploying heterologous expression. The generally compact nature of lasso peptide BGCs makes them particularly amenable to this approach, and, in the example given here, analysis revealed a new member of the lasso peptide family of RiPPs. This approach should be readily applicable to other cryptic lasso peptide gene clusters and would also facilitate the design and production of nonnatural variants by changing the sequence encoding the core peptide, as has been achieved with other classes of RiPPs.	1
Title: The structure of L-tyrosine 2,3-aminomutase from the C-1027 enediyne antitumor antibiotic biosynthetic pathway Abstract: The SgcC4 l-tyrosine 2,3-aminomutase (SgTAM) catalyzes the formation of (S)-beta-tyrosine in the biosynthetic pathway of the enediyne antitumor antibiotic C-1027. SgTAM is homologous to the histidine ammonia lyase family of enzymes whose activity is dependent on the methylideneimidazole-5-one (MIO) cofactor. Unlike the lyase enzymes, SgTAM catalyzes additional chemical transformations resulting in an overall stereospecific 1,2-amino shift in the substrate l-tyrosine to generate (S)-beta-tyrosine. Previously, we provided kinetic, spectroscopic, and mutagenesis data supporting the presence of MIO in the active site of SgTAM [Christenson, S. D.; Wu, W.; Spies, A.; Shen, B.; and Toney, M. D. (2003) Biochemistry 42, 12708-12718]. Here we report the first X-ray crystal structure of an MIO-containing aminomutase, SgTAM, and confirm the structural homology of SgTAM to ammonia lyases. Comparison of the structure of SgTAM to the l-tyrosine ammonia lyase from Rhodobacter sphaeroides provides insight into the structural basis for aminomutase activity. The results show that SgTAM has a closed active site well suited to retain ammonia and minimize the formation of lyase elimination products. The amino acid determinants for substrate recognition and catalysis can be predicted from the structure, setting the framework for detailed mechanistic investigations.	1
Title: Genome-wide identification of pathogenicity factors of the free-living amoeba Naegleria fowleri Abstract: Background:                       The free-living amoeba Naegleria fowleri is the causative agent of the rapidly progressing and typically fatal primary amoebic meningoencephalitis (PAM) in humans. Despite the devastating nature of this disease, which results in > 97% mortality, knowledge of the pathogenic mechanisms of the amoeba is incomplete. This work presents a comparative proteomic approach based on an experimental model in which the pathogenic potential of N. fowleri trophozoites is influenced by the compositions of different media.                  Results:                       As a scaffold for proteomic analysis, we sequenced the genome and transcriptome of N. fowleri. Since the sequence similarity of the recently published genome of Naegleria gruberi was far lower than the close taxonomic relationship of these species would suggest, a de novo sequencing approach was chosen. After excluding cell regulatory mechanisms originating from different media compositions, we identified 22 proteins with a potential role in the pathogenesis of PAM. Functional annotation of these proteins revealed, that the membrane is the major location where the amoeba exerts its pathogenic potential, possibly involving actin-dependent processes such as intracellular trafficking via vesicles.                  Conclusion:                       This study describes for the first time the 30 Mb-genome and the transcriptome sequence of N. fowleri and provides the basis for the further definition of effective intervention strategies against the rare but highly fatal form of amoebic meningoencephalitis.	0
Title: Biosynthesis of the myxobacterial antibiotic corallopyronin A Abstract: Corallopyronin A is a myxobacterial compound with potent antibacterial activity. Feeding experiments with labelled precursors resulted in the deduction of all biosynthetic building blocks for corallopyronin A and revealed an unusual feature of this metabolite: its biosynthesis from two chains, one solely PKS-derived and the other NRPS/PKS-derived. The starter molecule is believed to be carbonic acid or its monomethyl ester. The putative corallopyronin A biosynthetic gene cluster is a trans-AT-type mixed PKS/NRPS gene cluster, containing a beta-branching cassette. Striking features of this gene cluster are a NRPS-like adenylation domain that is part of a PKS-type module and is believed to be responsible for glycine incorporation, as well as split modules with individual domains occurring on different genes. It is suggested that CorB is a trans-acting ketosynthase and it is proposed that it catalyses the Claisen condensation responsible for the interconnection of the two chains. Additionally, the stereochemistry of corallopyronin A was deduced by a combination of a modified Mosher's method and ozonolysis with subsequent chiral GC analyses.	1
Title: Genetic Manipulation of an Aminotransferase Family Gene dtlA Activates Youssoufenes in Marine-Derived Streptomyces youssoufiensis Abstract: Disruption of an aminotransferase family gene dtlA activated the production of a novel dimeric benzoic polyene acids (BPAs), named youssoufene A1 (1), along with four new (2-5, youssoufenes B1-B4) and a known (6) monomeric BPA in the marine-derived Streptomyces youssoufiensis OUC6819. The structures of 1-5 were elucidated by extensive spectroscopic and computational approaches. Youssoufene A1 (1) exhibited notably increased growth inhibition (MIC = 12.5 μg/mL) against multidrug resistant Enterococcus faecalis compared to monomeric structures (2-6).	1
Title: Functional characterization of the ferroxidase, permease high-affinity iron transport complex from Candida albicans Abstract: Saccharomyces cerevisiae expresses two proteins that together support high-affinity Fe-uptake. These are a multicopper oxidase, Fet3p, with specificity towards Fe²⁺ and a ferric iron permease, Ftr1p, which supports Fe-accumulation. Homologues of the genes encoding these two proteins are found in all fungal genomes including those for the pathogens, Candida albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans. At least one of these loci represents a virulence factor for each pathogen suggesting that this complex would be an appropriate pharmacologic target. However, the mechanism by which this protein pair supports Fe-uptake in any fungal pathogen has not been elucidated. Taking advantage of the robust molecular genetics available in S. cerevisiae, we identify the two of five candidate ferroxidases likely involved in high-affinity Fe-uptake in C. albicans, Fet31 and Fet34. Both localize to the yeast plasma membrane and both support Fe-uptake along with an Ftr1 protein, either from C. albicans or from S. cerevisiae. We express and characterize Fet34, demonstrating that it is functionally homologous to ScFet3p. Using S. cerevisiae as host for the functional expression of the C. albicans Fe-uptake proteins, we demonstrate that they support a mechanism of Fe-trafficking that involves channelling of the CaFet34-generated Fe³⁺ directly to CaFtr1 for transport into the cytoplasm.	0
Title: An automated Genomes-to-Natural Products platform (GNP) for the discovery of modular natural products Abstract: Bacterial natural products are a diverse and valuable group of small molecules, and genome sequencing indicates that the vast majority remain undiscovered. The prediction of natural product structures from biosynthetic assembly lines can facilitate their discovery, but highly automated, accurate, and integrated systems are required to mine the broad spectrum of sequenced bacterial genomes. Here we present a genome-guided natural products discovery tool to automatically predict, combinatorialize and identify polyketides and nonribosomal peptides from biosynthetic assembly lines using LC-MS/MS data of crude extracts in a high-throughput manner. We detail the directed identification and isolation of six genetically predicted polyketides and nonribosomal peptides using our Genome-to-Natural Products platform. This highly automated, user-friendly programme provides a means of realizing the potential of genetically encoded natural products.	1
Title: A methyltransferase initiates terpene cyclization in teleocidin B biosynthesis Abstract: Teleocidin B is an indole terpenoid isolated from Streptomyces. Due to its unique chemical structure and ability to activate protein kinase C, it has attracted interest in the areas of organic chemistry and cell biology. Here, we report the identification of genes encoding enzymes for teleocidin B biosynthesis, including nonribosomal peptide synthetase (tleA), P-450 monooxygenase (tleB), prenyltransferase (tleC), and methyltransferase (tleD). The tleD gene, which is located outside of the tleABC cluster on the chromosome, was identified by transcriptional analysis and heterologous expression. Remarkably, TleD not only installs a methyl group on the geranyl moiety of the precursor but also facilitates the nucleophilic attack from the electron-rich indole to the resultant cation, to form the indole-fused six-membered ring. This is the first demonstration of a cation, generated from methylation, triggering successive terpenoid ring closure.	1
Title: Cleavage of four carbon-carbon bonds during biosynthesis of the griseorhodin a spiroketal pharmacophore Abstract: The rubromycins, such as gamma-rubromycin, heliquinomycin, and griseorhodin A, are a family of extensively modified aromatic polyketides that inhibit HIV reverse transcriptase and human telomerase. Telomerase inhibition crucially depends on the presence of a spiroketal moiety that is unique among aromatic polyketides. Biosynthetic incorporation of this pharmacophore into the rubromycins results in a dramatic distortion of the overall polyketide structure, but how this process is achieved by the cell has been obscure. To identify the enzymes involved in spiroketal construction, we generated 14 gene-deletion variants of the griseorhodin A biosynthetic gene cluster isolated from the tunicate-associated bacterium Streptomyces sp. JP95. Heterologous expression and metabolic analysis allowed for an assignment of most genes to various stages of griseorhodin tailoring and pharmacophore generation. The isolation of the novel advanced intermediate lenticulone, which exhibits cytotoxic, antibacterial, and elastase-inhibiting activity, provided direct evidence that the spiroketal is formed by cleavage of four carbon-carbon bonds in a pentangular polyketide precursor. This remarkable transformation is followed by an epoxidation catalyzed by an unusual cytochrome P450/NADPH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase pair that utilizes a saturated substrate. In addition, the absolute configuration of griseorhodin A was determined by quantum-chemical circular dichroism (CD) calculations in combination with experimental CD measurements.	1
Title: Isolation and identification of a Paenibacillus polymyxa strain that coproduces a novel lantibiotic and polymyxin Abstract: A new bacterial strain, displaying potent antimicrobial properties against gram-negative and gram-positive pathogenic bacteria, was isolated from food. Based on its phenotypical and biochemical properties as well as its 16S rRNA gene sequence, the bacterium was identified as Paenibacillus polymyxa and it was designated as strain OSY-DF. The antimicrobials produced by this strain were isolated from the fermentation broth and subsequently analyzed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Two antimicrobials were found: a known antibiotic, polymyxin E1, which is active against gram-negative bacteria, and an unknown 2,983-Da compound showing activity against gram-positive bacteria. The latter was purified to homogeneity, and its antimicrobial potency and proteinaceous nature were confirmed. The antimicrobial peptide, designated paenibacillin, is active against a broad range of food-borne pathogenic and spoilage bacteria, including Bacillus spp., Clostridium sporogenes, Lactobacillus spp., Lactococcus lactis, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Listeria spp., Pediococcus cerevisiae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus agalactiae. Furthermore, it possesses the physico-chemical properties of an ideal antimicrobial agent in terms of water solubility, thermal resistance, and stability against acid/alkali (pH 2.0 to 9.0) treatment. Edman degradation, mass spectroscopy, and nuclear magnetic resonance were used to sequence native and chemically modified paenibacillin. While details of the tentative sequence need to be elucidated in future work, the peptide was unequivocally characterized as a novel lantibiotic, with a high degree of posttranslational modifications. The coproduction of polymyxin E1 and a lantibiotic is a finding that has not been reported earlier. The new strain and associated peptide are potentially useful in food and medical applications.	1
Title: A high-throughput screen for chemical inhibitors of exocytic transport in yeast Abstract: Most of the components of the membrane and protein traffic machinery were discovered by perturbing their functions, either with bioactive compounds or by mutations. However, the mechanisms responsible for exocytic transport vesicle formation at the Golgi and endosomes are still largely unknown. Both the exocytic traffic routes and the signaling pathways that regulate these routes are highly complex and robust, so that defects can be overcome by alternate pathways or mechanisms. A classical yeast genetic screen designed to account for the robustness of the exocytic pathway identified a novel conserved gene, AVL9, which functions in late exocytic transport. We now describe a chemical-genetic version of the mutant screen, in which we performed a high-throughput phenotypic screen of a large compound library and identified novel small-molecule secretory inhibitors. To maximize the number and diversity of our hits, the screen was performed in a pdr5Delta snq2Delta mutant background, which lacks two transporters responsible for pleiotropic drug resistance. However, we found that deletion of both transporters reduced the fitness of our screen strain, whereas the pdr5Delta mutation had a relatively small effect on growth and was also the more important transporter mutation for conferring sensitivity to our hits. In this and similar chemical-genetic yeast screens, using just a single pump mutation might be sufficient for increasing hit diversity while minimizing the physiological effects of transporter mutations.	0
Title: Revised Structure of Anthelvencin A and Characterization of the Anthelvencin Biosynthetic Gene Cluster Abstract: Anthelvencins A and B are pyrrolamide metabolites produced by Streptomyces venezuelae ATCC 14583 and 14585. Isolated in 1965, they were reported to exhibit anthelmintic and moderate antibacterial activities. In this study, we revise the structure of anthelvencin A and identify a third anthelvencin metabolite, bearing two N-methylated pyrrole groups, which we named anthelvencin C. We sequenced the genome of S. venezuelae ATCC 14583 and identified a gene cluster predicted to direct the biosynthesis of anthelvencins. Functional analysis of this gene cluster confirmed its involvement in anthelvencin biosynthesis and allowed us to propose a biosynthetic pathway for anthelvencins. In addition to a nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS), the assembly of anthelvencins involves an enzyme from the ATP-grasp ligase family, Ant23. We propose that Ant23 uses a PCP-loaded 4-aminopyrrole-2-carboxylate as substrate. As observed for the biosynthesis of the other pyrrolamides congocidine (produced by Streptomyces ambofaciens ATCC 25877) and distamycin (produced by Streptomyces netropsis DSM 40846), the NRPS assembling anthelvencins is composed of stand-alone domains only. Such NRPSs, sometimes called type II NRPSs, are less studied than the classical multimodular NRPSs. Yet, they constitute an interesting model to study protein-protein interactions in NRPSs and are good candidates for combinatorial biosynthesis approaches.	1
Title: One Polyketide Synthase, Two Distinct Products: Trans-Acting Enzyme-Controlled Product Divergence in Calbistrin Biosynthesis Abstract: Calbistrins are fungal polyketides consisting of the characteristic decalin and polyene moieties. Although the biosynthetic gene cluster of calbistrin A was recently identified, the pathway of calbistrin A biosynthesis has largely remained uninvestigated. Herein, we investigated the mechanism by which the backbone structures of calbistrins are formed, by heterologous and in vitro reconstitution of the biosynthesis and a structural biological study. Intriguingly, our analyses revealed that the decalin and polyene portions of calbistrins are synthesized by the single polyketide synthase (PKS) CalA, with the aid of the trans-acting enoylreductase CalK and the trans-acting C-methyltransferase CalH, respectively. We also determined that the esterification of the two polyketide parts is catalyzed by the acyltransferase CalD. Our study has uncovered a novel dual-functional PKS and thus broadened our understanding of how fungi synthesize diverse polyketide natural products.	1
Title: Accurate prediction of secondary metabolite gene clusters in filamentous fungi Abstract: Biosynthetic pathways of secondary metabolites from fungi are currently subject to an intense effort to elucidate the genetic basis for these compounds due to their large potential within pharmaceutics and synthetic biochemistry. The preferred method is methodical gene deletions to identify supporting enzymes for key synthases one cluster at a time. In this study, we design and apply a DNA expression array for Aspergillus nidulans in combination with legacy data to form a comprehensive gene expression compendium. We apply a guilt-by-association-based analysis to predict the extent of the biosynthetic clusters for the 58 synthases active in our set of experimental conditions. A comparison with legacy data shows the method to be accurate in 13 of 16 known clusters and nearly accurate for the remaining 3 clusters. Furthermore, we apply a data clustering approach, which identifies cross-chemistry between physically separate gene clusters (superclusters), and validate this both with legacy data and experimentally by prediction and verification of a supercluster consisting of the synthase AN1242 and the prenyltransferase AN11080, as well as identification of the product compound nidulanin A. We have used A. nidulans for our method development and validation due to the wealth of available biochemical data, but the method can be applied to any fungus with a sequenced and assembled genome, thus supporting further secondary metabolite pathway elucidation in the fungal kingdom.	1
Title: Autoregulation of microRNA biogenesis by let-7 and Argonaute Abstract: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) comprise a large family of small RNA molecules that post-transcriptionally regulate gene expression in many biological pathways. Most miRNAs are derived from long primary transcripts that undergo processing by Drosha to produce ~65-nucleotide precursors that are then cleaved by Dicer, resulting in the mature 22-nucleotide forms. Serving as guides in Argonaute protein complexes, mature miRNAs use imperfect base pairing to recognize sequences in messenger RNA transcripts, leading to translational repression and destabilization of the target messenger RNAs. Here we show that the miRNA complex also targets and regulates non-coding RNAs that serve as substrates for the miRNA-processing pathway. We found that the Argonaute protein in Caenorhabditis elegans, ALG-1, binds to a specific site at the 3′ end of let-7 miRNA primary transcripts and promotes downstream processing events. This interaction is mediated by mature let-7 miRNA through a conserved complementary site in its own primary transcript, thus creating a positive-feedback loop. We further show that ALG-1 associates with let-7 primary transcripts in nuclear fractions. Argonaute also binds let-7 primary transcripts in human cells, demonstrating that the miRNA pathway targets non-coding RNAs in addition to protein-coding messenger RNAs across species. Moreover, our studies in C. elegans reveal a novel role for Argonaute in promoting biogenesis of a targeted transcript, expanding the functions of the miRNA pathway in gene regulation. This discovery of autoregulation of let-7 biogenesis establishes a new mechanism for controlling miRNA expression.	0
Title: Pseudophedrine-Derived Myers Enolates: Structures and Influence of Lithium Chloride on Reactivity and Mechanism Abstract: The structures and reactivities of pseudoephedrine-derived dianionic Myers enolates are examined. A combination of NMR and IR spectroscopic, crystallographic, and computational data reveal that the homoaggregated dianions form octalithiated tetramers displaying S4-symmetric Li8O8 cores and overall C2 symmetry. Computational and isotopic labeling studies reveal strong N-Li contacts in the carboxamide enolate moiety. The method of continuous variations proves deceptive, as octalithiated tetrameric homoaggregates afford hexalithiated trimeric heteroaggregates. A lithium diisopropylamide-lithium enolate mixed aggregate is found to be a C2-symmetric hexalithiated species incorporating two enolate dianions and two lithium diisopropylamide (LDA) subunits. Structural and rate studies show that lithium chloride has little effect on the dynamics of the enolate homoaggregates but forms adducts of unknown structure. Rate studies of alkylations indicate that the aging of the aggregates can have effects spanning orders of magnitude. The LiCl-enolate adduct dramatically accelerates the reaction but requires superstoichiometric quantities owing to putative autoinhibition. Efforts and progress toward eliminating the requisite large excess of LiCl are discussed.	0
Title: Nickel-Catalyzed Chemo- and Enantioselective Coupling between Cyclobutanones and Allenes: Rapid Synthesis of [3.2.2] Bicycles Abstract: Herein an intramolecular nickel-catalyzed (4+2) coupling between cyclobutanones and allenes, by C-C cleavage, is reported. The reaction provides a distinct approach for accessing [3.2.2] bicyclic scaffolds which are challenging to prepare through conventional approaches. The reaction is efficient, chemoselective, and pH/redox neutral. Room temperature conditions and low catalyst loadings can be adopted. Excellent enantioselectivity is also achieved.	0
Title: Synthesis of nitric oxide probes with fluorescence lifetime sensitivity Abstract: We present the rationale, synthesis and evaluation of the first activatable fluorescent probe that utilizes fluorescence lifetime change for detection of nitric oxide. The new probe DAP-LT1 features a near-infrared polymethine skeleton with a diaminobenzene functionality incorporated into the meso-position. The probe is partially quenched, and upon reaction with nitric oxide shows an increase in the fluorescence lifetime from 1.08 ns to 1.24 ns.	0
Title: Metabolic changes in Klebsiella oxytoca in response to low oxidoreduction potential, as revealed by comparative proteomic profiling integrated with flux balance analysis Abstract: Oxidoreduction potential (ORP) is an important physiological parameter for biochemical production in anaerobic or microaerobic processes. However, the effect of ORP on cellular physiology remains largely unknown, which hampers the design of engineering strategies targeting proteins associated with ORP response. Here we characterized the effect of altering ORP in a 1,3-propanediol producer, Klebsiella oxytoca, by comparative proteomic profiling combined with flux balance analysis. Decreasing the extracellular ORP from -150 to -240 mV retarded cell growth and enhanced 1,3-propanediol production. Comparative proteomic analysis identified 61 differentially expressed proteins, mainly involved in carbohydrate catabolism, cellular constituent biosynthesis, and reductive stress response. A hypothetical oxidoreductase (HOR) that catalyzes 1,3-propanediol production was markedly upregulated, while proteins involved in biomass precursor synthesis were downregulated. As revealed by subsequent flux balance analysis, low ORP induced a metabolic shift from glycerol oxidation to reduction and rebalancing of redox and energy metabolism. From the integrated protein expression profiles and flux distributions, we can construct a rational analytic framework that elucidates how (facultative) anaerobes respond to extracellular ORP changes.	0
Title: Sequential action of two flavoenzymes, PgaE and PgaM, in angucycline biosynthesis: chemoenzymatic synthesis of gaudimycin C Abstract: Tailoring steps in aromatic polyketide antibiotic biosynthesis are an important source of structural diversity and, consequently, an intriguing focal point for enzymological studies. PgaE and PgaM from Streptomyces sp. PGA64 are representatives of flavoenzymes catalyzing early post-PKS reactions in angucycline biosynthesis. This in vitro study illustrates that the chemoenzymatic conversion of UWM6 into the metabolite, gaudimycin C, requires multiple closely coupled reactions to prevent intermediate degradation. The NMR structure of gaudimycin C confirms that the reaction cascade involves C12- and C12b-hydroxylation, C2,3-dehydration, and stereospecific ketoreduction at C6. Enzymatic 18O incorporation studies verify that the oxygens at C12 and C12b derive from O2 and H2O, respectively. The results indicate that PgaM deviates mechanistically from flavoprotein monooxygenases, and suggest an alternative catalytic mechanism involving a quinone methide intermediate.	1
Title: Identification of the mokH gene encoding transcription factor for the upregulation of monacolin K biosynthesis in Monascus pilosus Abstract: Monacolin K is a secondary metabolite synthesized by polyketide synthases (PKS) from Monascus. The monacolin K biosynthetic gene cluster, mokA-mokI, has been characterized in Monascus pilosus. The mokH gene encoding Zn(II)2Cys6 binuclear DNA binding protein is assumed to be an activator for monacolin K production. In this study, the mokH gene was cloned and driven by the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gpd) promoter for overexpression in M. pilosus. The transformants containing an extra copy of the mokH gene were obtained and verified by PCR and Southern hybridization. The transcripts of mokH in the transformants were expressed significantly higher than those of the wild-type strain. The transformants were stably inherited through the next generation, as determined by observation of the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP). The transformant T-mokH1 also showed a 1.7-fold higher production of monacolin K than the wild-type strain in a time course analysis. Analysis of the RT-PCR products demonstrated that the monacolin K biosynthetic genes in the transformant were expressed to a greater extent than those in the wild-type strain. These results indicated that mokH upregulated the transcription of monacolin K biosynthetic genes and increased monacolin K production.	1
Title: Insights into Interactions of Mycobacteria with the Host Innate Immune System from a Novel Array of Synthetic Mycobacterial Glycans Abstract: An array of homogeneous glycans representing all the major carbohydrate structures present in the cell wall of the human pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis and other mycobacteria has been probed with a panel of glycan-binding receptors expressed on cells of the mammalian innate immune system. The results provide an overview of interactions between mycobacterial glycans and receptors that mediate uptake and survival in macrophages, dendritic cells, and sinusoidal endothelial cells. A subset of the wide variety of glycan structures present on mycobacterial surfaces interact with cells of the innate immune system through the receptors tested. Endocytic receptors, including the mannose receptor, DC-SIGN, langerin, and DC-SIGNR (L-SIGN), interact predominantly with mannose-containing caps found on the mycobacterial polysaccharide lipoarabinomannan. Some of these receptors also interact with phosphatidyl-myo-inositol mannosides and mannose-containing phenolic glycolipids. Many glycans are ligands for overlapping sets of receptors, suggesting multiple, redundant routes by which mycobacteria can enter cells. Receptors with signaling capability interact with two distinct sets of mycobacterial glycans: targets for dectin-2 overlap with ligands for the mannose-binding endocytic receptors, while mincle binds exclusively to trehalose-containing structures such as trehalose dimycolate. None of the receptors surveyed bind furanose residues, which often form part of the epitopes recognized by antibodies to mycobacteria. Thus, the innate and adaptive immune systems can target different sets of mycobacterial glycans. This array, the first of its kind, represents an important new tool for probing, at a molecular level, biological roles of a broad range of mycobacterial glycans, a task that has not previously been possible.	0
Title: A cryptic type I polyketide synthase (cpk) gene cluster in Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) Abstract: The chromosome of Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2), a model organism for the genus Streptomyces, contains a cryptic type I polyketide synthase (PKS) gene cluster which was revealed when the genome was sequenced. The ca. 54-kb cluster contains three large genes, cpkA, cpkB and cpkC, encoding the PKS subunits. In silico analysis showed that the synthase consists of a loading module, five extension modules and a unique reductase as a terminal domain instead of a typical thioesterase. All acyltransferase domains are specific for a malonyl extender, and have a B-type ketoreductase. Tailoring and regulatory genes were also identified within the gene cluster. Surprisingly, some genes show high similarity to primary metabolite genes not commonly identified in any antibiotic biosynthesis cluster. Using western blot analysis with a PKS subunit (CpkC) antibody, CpkC was shown to be expressed in S. coelicolor at transition phase. Disruption of cpkC gave no obvious phenotype.	1
Title: Identification and characterization of the echinocandin B biosynthetic gene cluster from Emericella rugulosa NRRL 11440 Abstract: Echinocandins are a family of fungal lipidated cyclic hexapeptide natural products. Due to their effectiveness as antifungal agents, three semisynthetic derivatives have been developed and approved for treatment of human invasive candidiasis. All six of the amino acid residues are hydroxylated, including 4R,5R-dihydroxy-L-ornithine, 4R-hydroxyl-L-proline, 3S,4S-dihydroxy-L-homotyrosine, and 3S-hydroxyl-4S-methyl-L-proline. We report here the biosynthetic gene cluster of echinocandin B 1 from Emericella rugulosa NRRL 11440 containing genes encoding for a six-module nonribosomal peptide synthetase EcdA, an acyl-AMP ligase EcdI, and oxygenases EcdG, EcdH, and EcdK. We showed EcdI activates linoleate as linoleyl-AMP and installs it on the first thiolation domain of EcdA. We have also established through ATP-PP(i) exchange assay that EcdA loads L-ornithine in the first module. A separate hty gene cluster encodes four enzymes for de novo generation of L-homotyrosine from acetyl-CoA and 4-hydroxyphenyl-pyruvate is found from the sequenced genome. Deletions in the ecdA, and htyA genes validate their essential roles in echinocandin B production. Five predicted iron-centered oxygenase genes, ecdG, ecdH, ecdK, htyE, and htyF, in the two separate ecd and hty clusters are likely to be the tailoring oxygenases for maturation of the nascent NRPS lipohexapeptidolactam product.	1
Title: Engineering the redox potential over a wide range within a new class of FeS proteins Abstract: MitoNEET is a newly discovered mitochondrial protein and a target of the TZD class of antidiabetes drugs. MitoNEET is homodimeric with each protomer binding a [2Fe-2S] center through a rare 3-Cys and 1-His coordination geometry. Both the fold and the coordination of the [2Fe-2S] centers suggest that it could have novel properties compared to other known [2Fe-2S] proteins. We tested the robustness of mitoNEET to mutation and the range over which the redox potential (E(M)) could be tuned. We found that the protein could tolerate an array of mutations that modified the E(M) of the [2Fe-2S] center over a range of ∼700 mV, which is the largest E(M) range engineered in an FeS protein and, importantly, spans the cellular redox range (+200 to -300 mV). These properties make mitoNEET potentially useful for both physiological studies and industrial applications as a stable, water-soluble, redox agent.	0
Title: Single microspore reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction: dynamic change of gene expression during microsporogenesis Abstract: A sensitive and reliable single microspore reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay was developed that requires little sample material and only a short sampling time and ensures template preservation. We propose that the assay provides a useful tool to study not only cell-cycle related events in developing pollen but also the molecular mechanisms underlying male sterility and mutants impaired in pollen development.	0
Title: Synthesis and structure-activity studies of new 4''-O-acyltylosin derivatives of therapeutic interest Abstract: Eleven 4''-O-acyltylosin derivatives were synthesized and subjected to a two-step screening system consisting of antimicrobial activity and esterase stability assays. The new derivatives were all active against macrolide-resistant Staphylococci and mycoplasmas, but only 4''-O-(4-methoxy)phenylacetyltylosin and 4''-O-(4-acetyl)phenylacetyltylosin showed better resistance to mouse liver esterase than 4''-O-phenylacetyltylosin (reference compound C).	0
Title: Inhibition of erythromycin synthesis by disruption of malonyl-coenzyme A decarboxylase gene eryM in Saccharopolyspora erythraea Abstract: Malonyl-coenzyme A (malonyl-CoA) decarboxylase is widely distributed in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. However, the biological function of this enzyme has not been established in any organism. To elucidate the structure and function of this enzyme, the malonyl-CoA decarboxylase gene from Saccharopolyspora erythraea (formerly Streptomyces erythreaus) was cloned and sequenced. This gene would encode a polypeptide of 417 amino acids. The deduced amino acid sequence matched the experimentally determined amino acid sequences of 25 N-terminal residues each of the enzyme and of an internal peptide obtained by proteolysis of the purified enzyme. This decarboxylase showed homology with aminoglycoside N6'-acetyltransferases of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Northern (RNA) blot analysis revealed a single transcript. The transcription initiation site was 220 bp upstream of the start codon. When expressed in Escherichia coli, the S. erythraea malonyl-CoA decarboxylase gene yielded a protein that cross-reacted with antiserum prepared against S. erythraea malonyl-CoA decarboxylase and catalyzed decarboxylation of [3-14C]malonyl-CoA to acetyl-CoA and 14CO2. The S. erythraea malonyl-CoA decarboxylase gene was disrupted by homologous recombination using an integrating vector pWHM3. The gene-disrupted transformant did not produce immunologically cross-reacting 45-kDa decarboxylase, lacked malonyl-CoA decarboxylase activity, and could not produce erythromycin. Exogenous propionate restored the ability to produce erythromycin. These results strongly suggest that the decarboxylase provides propionyl-CoA for erythromycin synthesis probably via decarboxylation of methylmalonyl-CoA derived from succinyl-CoA, and therefore the malonyl-CoA decarboxylase gene is designated eryM. The gene disrupted mutants also did not produce pigments.	1
Title: Selective N1/N4 1,4-Cycloaddition of 1,2,4,5-Tetrazines Enabled by Solvent Hydrogen Bonding Abstract: An unprecedented 1,4-cycloaddition (vs 3,6-cycloaddition) of 1,2,4,5-tetrazines is described with preformed or in situ generated aryl-conjugated enamines promoted by the solvent hydrogen bonding of hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP) that is conducted under mild reaction conditions (0.1 M HFIP, 25 °C, 12 h). The reaction constitutes a formal [4 + 2] cycloaddition across the two nitrogen atoms (N1/N4) of the 1,2,4,5-tetrazine followed by a formal retro [4 + 2] cycloaddition loss of a nitrile and aromatization to generate a 1,2,4-triazine derivative. The factors that impact the remarkable change in the reaction mode, optimization of reaction parameters, the scope and simplification of its implementation through in situ enamine generation from aldehydes and ketones, the reaction scope for 3,6-bis(thiomethyl)-1,2,4,5-tetrazine, a survey of participating 1,2,4,5-tetrazines, and key mechanistic insights into this reaction are detailed. Given its simplicity and breath, the study establishes a novel method for the simple and efficient one-step synthesis of 1,2,4-triazines under mild conditions from readily accessible starting materials. Whereas alternative protic solvents (e.g., MeOH vs HFIP) provide products of the conventional 3,6-cycoladdition, the enhanced hydrogen bonding capability of HFIP uniquely results in promotion of the unprecedented formal 1,4-cycloaddition. As such, the studies represent an example of not just an enhancement in the rate or efficiency of a heterocyclic azadiene cycloaddition by hydrogen bonding catalysis but also the first to alter the mode (N1/N4 vs C3/C6) of cycloaddition.	0
Title: AL072, a novel anti-Legionella antibiotic produced by Streptomyces sp Abstract: AL072 is a potent anti-Legionella antibiotic produced by Streptomyces strain AL91. The compound was isolated from the fermentation broth with 1 volume of isopropyl alcohol, followed by an ethyl acetate extraction and subsequent concentration under reduced pressure. Purification was performed on an octadecyl silica gel column followed by preparative HPLC. AL072 purified as mentioned above showed extremely specific activity only towards Legionella pneumophila. No antibacterial activity against any other bacteria tested was demonstrable. Its molecular weight was determined by FAB-MS (m/z 648) and the compound was identified as a novel 1,3-diacyl glycerol with the molecular formula C41H76O5. One of the two acyl groups is linoleyl and the other is 3,5-dimethyl octadecanoyl.	0
Title: Identification of genetic defects in the atoxigenic biocontrol strain Aspergillus flavus K49 reveals the presence of a competitive recombinant group in field populations Abstract: Contamination of corn, cotton, peanuts and tree nuts by aflatoxins is a severe economic burden for growers. A current biocontrol strategy is to use non-aflatoxigenic Aspergillus flavus strains to competitively exclude field toxigenic Aspergillus species. A. flavus K49 does not produce aflatoxins and cyclopiazonic acid (CPA) and is currently being tested in corn-growing fields in Mississippi. We found that its lack of production of aflatoxins and CPA resulted from single nucleotide mutations in the polyketide synthase gene and hybrid polyketide-nonribosomal peptide synthase gene, respectively. Furthermore, based on single nucleotide polymorphisms of the aflatoxin biosynthesis omtA gene and the CPA biosynthesis dmaT gene, we conclude that K49, AF36 and previously characterized TX9-8 form a biocontrol group. These isolates appear to be derived from recombinants of typical large and small sclerotial morphotype strains. This finding provides an easy way to select future biocontrol strains from the reservoir of non-aflatoxigenic populations in agricultural fields.	1
Title: In vivo biosynthesis of terpene nucleosides provides unique chemical markers of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection Abstract: Although small molecules shed from pathogens are widely used to diagnose infection, such tests have not been widely implemented for tuberculosis. Here we show that the recently identified compound, 1-tuberculosinyladenosine (1-TbAd), accumulates to comprise >1% of all Mycobacterium tuberculosis lipid. In vitro and in vivo, two isomers of TbAd were detected that might serve as infection markers. Using mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance, we established the structure of the previously unknown molecule, N(6)-tuberculosinyladenosine (N(6)-TbAd). Its biosynthesis involves enzymatic production of 1-TbAd by Rv3378c followed by conversion to N(6)-TbAd via the Dimroth rearrangement. Intact biosynthetic genes are observed only within M. tuberculosis complex bacteria, and TbAd was not detected among other medically important pathogens, environmental bacteria, and vaccine strains. With no substantially similar known molecules in nature, the discovery and in vivo detection of two abundant terpene nucleosides support their development as specific diagnostic markers of tuberculosis.	0
Title: Characterization of a Citrulline 4-Hydroxylase from Nonribosomal Peptide GE81112 Biosynthesis and Engineering of Its Substrate Specificity for the Chemoenzymatic Synthesis of Enduracididine Abstract: The GE81112 tetrapeptides are a small family of unusual nonribosomal peptide congeners with potent inhibitory activity against prokaryotic translation initiation. With the exception of the 3-hydroxy-l-pipecolic acid unit, little is known about the biosynthetic origins of the non-proteinogenic amino acid monomers of the natural product family. Here, we elucidate the biogenesis of the 4-hydroxy-l-citrulline unit and establish the role of an iron- and α-ketoglutarate-dependent enzyme (Fe/αKG) in the pathway. Homology modelling and sequence alignment analysis further facilitate the rational engineering of this enzyme to become a specific 4-arginine hydroxylase. We subsequently demonstrate the utility of this engineered enzyme in the synthesis of a dipeptide fragment of the antibiotic enduracidin. This work highlights the value of applying a bioinformatics-guided approach in the discovery of novel enzymes and engineering of new catalytic activity into existing ones.	0
Title: Post-polyketide synthase steps in iso-migrastatin biosynthesis, featuring tailoring enzymes with broad substrate specificity Abstract: The iso-migrastatin (iso-MGS) biosynthetic gene cluster from Streptomyces platensis NRRL 18993 consists of 11 genes, featuring an acyltransferase (AT)-less type I polyketide synthase (PKS) and three tailoring enzymes MgsIJK. Systematic inactivation of mgsIJK in S. platensis enabled us to (i) identify two nascent products of the iso-MGS AT-less type I PKS, establishing an unprecedented novel feature for AT-less type I PKSs, and (ii) account for the formation of all known post-PKS biosynthetic intermediates generated by the three tailoring enzymes MgsIJK, which possessed significant substrate promiscuities.	1
Title: Nonactin biosynthesis: the potential nonactin biosynthesis gene cluster contains type II polyketide synthase-like genes Abstract: Nonactin is the parent compound of a group of highly atypical polyketide metabolites produced by Streptomyces griseus subsp. griseus ETH A7796. In this paper we describe the isolation, sequencing, and analysis of 15¿ omitted¿559 bp of chromosomal DNA, containing the potential nonactin biosynthesis gene cluster, from S. griseus subsp. griseus ETH A7796. Fourteen open reading frames were observed in the DNA sequence. Significantly, type II polyketide synthase (PKS) homologues were discovered in an apparent operon structure, which also contained the nonactate synthase gene (nonS), clustered with the tetranactin resistance gene. The deduced products of two of the genes (nonK and nonJ) are quite unusual ketoacyl synthase (KAS) alpha and KASbeta homologues. We speculate that nonactic acid, the polyketide precursor of nonactin, is synthesized by a type II PKS system.	1
Title: Characterizing the role of the microtubule binding protein Bim1 in Cryptococcus neoformans Abstract: During sexual development the human fungal pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans undergoes a developmental transition from yeast-form growth to filamentous growth. This transition requires cellular restructuring to form a filamentous dikaryon. Dikaryotic growth also requires tightly controlled nuclear migration to ensure faithful replication and dissemination of genetic material to spore progeny. Although the gross morphological changes that take place during dikaryotic growth are largely known, the molecular underpinnings that control this process are uncharacterized. Here we identify and characterize a C. neoformans homolog of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae BIM1 gene, and establish the importance of BIM1 for proper filamentous growth of C. neoformans. Deletion of BIM1 leads to truncated sexual development filaments, a severe defect in diploid formation, and a block in monokaryotic fruiting. Our findings lead to a model consistent with a critical role for BIM1 in both filament integrity and nuclear congression that is mediated through the microtubule cytoskeleton.	0
Title: T-LAK cell-originated protein kinase (TOPK) phosphorylation of Prx1 at Ser-32 prevents UVB-induced apoptosis in RPMI7951 melanoma cells through the regulation of Prx1 peroxidase activity Abstract: Protein kinases are potential targets for the prevention and control of UV-induced skin cancer. T-cell-originated protein kinase (TOPK) is highly expressed in skin cancer cells, but its specific function is still unknown. We investigated the role of TOPK in UVB-induced apoptosis in RPMI7951 human melanoma cells. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis was used to identify proteins that bind with TOPK. Immunofluorescence, Western blot, and flow cytometry were used to assess the effect of UVB on TOPK, peroxiredoxin 1 (Prx1), and apoptosis in RPMI7951 cells. TOPK binds with Prx1 and its phosphorylation of Prx1 at Ser-32 is important for regulation of H(2)O(2)-mediated signal transduction. Analysis of the CD spectra of Prx1 and mutant Prx1 (S32A) proteins showed that the secondary structure of Prx1 was significantly altered by phosphorylation of Prx1 at Ser-32. UVB irradiation induced phosphorylation of TOPK in RPMI7951 human melanoma cells and phosphorylated TOPK co-localized with Prx1 in the nucleus. UVB induced the peroxidase activity of Prx1 in vitro and ex vivo. Following treatment with UVB, H(2)O(2) levels and apoptosis were increased in RPMI7951 cells stably expressing TOPK siRNA or stably mutant Prx1 (S32A). Phosphorylation of Prx1 (Ser-32) by TOPK prevents UVB-induced apoptosis in RPMI7951 melanoma cells through regulation of Prx1 peroxidase activity and blockade of intracellular H(2)O(2) accumulation.	0
Title: Fluorescent visualization of Src by using dasatinib-BODIPY Abstract: Many biological experiments are not compatible with the use of immunofluorescence, genetically encoded fluorescent tags, or FRET-based reporters. Conjugation of existing kinase inhibitors to cell-permeable fluorophores can provide a generalized approach to develop fluorescent probes of intracellular kinases. Here, we report the development of a small molecule probe of Src through conjugation of BODIPY to two well-established dual Src-Abl kinase inhibitors, dasatinib and saracatinib. We show that this approach is not successful for saracatinib but that dasatinib-BODIPY largely retains the biological activity of its parent compound and can be used to monitor the presence of Src kinase in individual cells by flow cytometry. It can also be used to track the localization of Src by fixed and live-cell fluorescence microscopy. This strategy could enable generation of additional kinase-specific probes useful in systems not amenable to genetic manipulation or could be used together with fluorescent proteins to enable a multiplexed assay readout.	0
Title: Nucleotide sequence of the Salmonella typhimurium origin of DNA replication Abstract: Construction of deletion derivative plasmids and cloning of restriction fragments from plasmids containing the Salmonella typhimurium origin of replication (ori) were used to locate the functional origin to within a DNA fragment of 296 base pairs between the genes uncB and asn. The nucleotide sequence of the S. typhimurium ori region was determined and compared with the Escherichia coli ori sequence. In the 296-base pair fragment, 85.8% of the bases are conserved between the two species. A nearly equal number of transition and transversion type differences, with no insertions or deletions, occurs between the two bacterial origins, such that the relatively high percentage (adenine plus thymine) of 59.5% is conserved. The 296-base pair fragment contains 14 GATC sequences, all of which are conserved. The high frequency of occurrence of GATC, which is the site of methylation under control of the dam gene, may explain in part why the bacterial ori region appears to be so highly conserved. A large number of secondary structures are possible. One such structure, with a "cloverleaf," is favored by ori nucleotide sequence comparisons and leads to potential novel macromolecular interactions.	0
Title: Recognition of individual genes in a single bacterial cell by fluorescence in situ hybridization--RING-FISH Abstract: Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using rRNA targeted oligonucleotide probes is a standard method for identification of microorganisms in environmental samples. Apart from its value as a phylogenetic marker ribosomal RNA has always been the favoured target molecule for FISH because of its abundance in all cells, whereas plasmids and DNA were regarded as unsuitable targets because of their low copy number. Here we present an improved FISH technique, which is based on polynucleotide probes. It goes beyond the detection of high copy intracellular nucleic acids such as rRNA (up to 10(4)-10(5) copies per cell) and allows for the first time the in situ detection of individual genes or gene fragments on plasmids (10(1)-10(3) copies per cell) and chromosomal DNA (<10 copies per cell) in a single cell. Using E. coli as model organism we were able to detect in situ cells harbouring the antibiotic resistance gene beta lactamase on high, medium and low copy plasmids as well as the chromosomal encoded housekeeping gene glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). Furthermore, we detected the prepilin peptidase gene xpsO in the plant pathogen Xanthomonas campestris in situ. Because of the characteristic hybridization signal obtained with this method--a halo-like, ring-shaped concentration of fluorescence in the cell periphery--we coined the term RING-FISH (recognition of individual genes) to differentiate it from conventional FISH.	0
Title: NosA, a transcription factor important in Aspergillus fumigatus stress and developmental response, rescues the germination defect of a laeA deletion Abstract: Aspergillus fumigatus is an increasingly serious pathogen of immunocompromised patients, causing the often fatal disease invasive aspergillosis (IA). One A. fumigatus virulence determinant of IA is LaeA, a conserved virulence factor in pathogenic fungi. To further understand the role of LaeA in IA, the expression profile of ΔlaeA was compared to wild type, and several transcription factors were found significantly misregulated by LaeA loss. One of the transcription factors up-regulated over 4-fold in the ΔlaeA strain was Afu4g09710, similar in sequence to Aspergillus nidulans NosA, which is involved in sexual development. Here we assessed loss of nosA (ΔnosA) and overexpression of nosA (OE::nosA) on A. fumigatus in both a wild type and ΔlaeA background. Based on the multiple alterations of physiological development of single and double mutants, we suggest that NosA mediates the decreased radial growth and delayed conidial germination observed in ΔlaeA strains, the former in a light dependent manner. The ΔnosA mutant showed increased virulence in the Galleria mellonella larvae model of disseminated aspergillosis, potentially due to its increased growth and germination rate. Furthermore, the A. fumigatus nosA allele was able to partially remediate sexual development in an A. nidulans ΔnosA background. Likewise, the A. nidulans nosA allele was able to restore the menadione sensitivity defect of the A. fumigatus ΔnosA strain, suggesting conservation of function of the NosA protein in these two species.	0
Title: Knockout of the erythromycin biosynthetic cluster gene, eryBI, blocks isoflavone glucoside bioconversion during erythromycin fermentations in Aeromicrobium erythreum but not in Saccharopolyspora erythraea Abstract: Isoflavone glucosides are valuable nutraceutical compounds and are present in commercial fermentations, such as the erythromycin fermentation, as constituents of the soy flour in the growth medium. The purpose of this study was to develop a method for recovery of the isoflavone glucosides as value-added coproducts at the end of either Saccharopolyspora erythraea or Aeromicrobium erythreum fermentation. Because the first step in isoflavone metabolism was known to be the conversion of isoflavone glucosides to aglycones by a beta-glucosidase, we chose to knock out the only beta-glucosidase gene known at the start of the study, eryBI, to see what effect this had on metabolism of isoflavone glucosides in each organism. In the unicellular erythromycin producer A. erythreum, knockout of eryBI was sufficient to block the conversion of isoflavone glucosides to aglycones. In S. erythraea, knockout of eryBI had no effect on this reaction, suggesting that other beta-glucosidases are present. Erythromycin production was not significantly affected in either strain as a result of the eryBI knockout. This study showed that isoflavone metabolism could be blocked in A. erythreum by eryBI knockout but that eryBI knockout was not sufficient to block isoflavone metabolism in S. erythraea.	1
Title: TREM-1 links dyslipidemia to inflammation and lipid deposition in atherosclerosis Abstract: Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-1 (TREM-1) is a potent amplifier of pro-inflammatory innate immune responses, but its significance in non-infectious diseases remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that TREM-1 promotes cardiovascular disease by exacerbating atherosclerosis. TREM-1 is expressed in advanced human atheromas and is highly upregulated under dyslipidemic conditions on circulating and on lesion-infiltrating myeloid cells in the Apoe-/- mouse model. TREM-1 strongly contributes to high-fat, high-cholesterol diet (HFCD)-induced monocytosis and synergizes with HFCD serum-derived factors to promote pro-inflammatory cytokine responses and foam cell formation of human monocyte/macrophages. Trem1-/-Apoe-/- mice exhibit substantially attenuated diet-induced atherogenesis. In particular, our results identify skewed monocyte differentiation and enhanced lipid accumulation as novel mechanisms through which TREM-1 can promote atherosclerosis. Collectively, our findings illustrate that dyslipidemia induces TREM-1 surface expression on myeloid cells and subsequently synergizes with TREM-1 to enhance monopoiesis, pro-atherogenic cytokine production and foam cell formation.	0
Title: High order quaternary arrangement confers increased structural stability to Brucella sp. lumazine synthase Abstract: The penultimate step in the pathway of riboflavin biosynthesis is catalyzed by the enzyme lumazine synthase (LS). One of the most distinctive characteristics of this enzyme is the structural quaternary divergence found in different species. The protein exists as pentameric and icosahedral forms, built from practically the same structural monomeric unit. The pentameric structure is formed by five 18-kDa monomers, each extensively contacting neighboring monomers. The icosahedrical structure consists of 60 LS monomers arranged as 12 pentamers giving rise to a capsid exhibiting icosahedral 532 symmetry. In all lumazine synthases studied, the topologically equivalent active sites are located at the interfaces between adjacent subunits in the pentameric modules. The Brucella sp. lumazine synthase (BLS) sequence clearly diverges from pentameric and icosahedric enzymes. This unusual divergence prompted us to further investigate its quaternary arrangement. In the present work, we demonstrate by means of solution light scattering and x-ray structural analyses that BLS assembles as a very stable dimer of pentamers, representing a third category of quaternary assembly for lumazine synthases. We also describe by spectroscopic studies the thermodynamic stability of this oligomeric protein and postulate a mechanism for dissociation/unfolding of this macromolecular assembly. The higher molecular order of BLS increases its stability 20 degrees C compared with pentameric lumazine synthases. The decameric arrangement described in this work highlights the importance of quaternary interactions in the stabilization of proteins.	0
Title: Genomic Insights into Omega-3 Polyunsaturated Fatty Acid Producing Shewanella sp. N2AIL from Fish Gut Abstract: The genus Shewanella is widely distributed in niches ranging from an aquatic environment to spoiled fish and is loaded with various ecologically and commercially important metabolites. Bacterial species under this genus find application in bioelectricity generation and bioremediation due to their capability to use pollutants as the terminal electron acceptor and could produce health-beneficial omega-3 fatty acids, particularly eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). Here, the genome sequence of an EPA-producing bacterium, Shewanella sp. N2AIL, isolated from the gastrointestinal tract of Tilapia fish, is reported. The genome size of the strain was 4.8 Mb with a GC content of 46.3% containing 4385 protein-coding genes. Taxonogenomic analysis assigned this strain to the genus Shewanella on the basis of average nucleotide identity (ANI) and in silico DNA-DNA hybridization (DDH), phylogenetically most closely related with S. baltica NCTC 10735T. The comparative genome analysis with the type strain of S. baltica revealed 693 unique genes in the strain N2AIL, highlighting the variation at the strain level. The genes associated with stress adaptation, secondary metabolite production, antibiotic resistance, and metal reduction were identified in the genome suggesting the potential of the bacterium to be explored as an industrially important strain. PUFA synthase gene cluster of size ~20.5 kb comprising all the essential domains for EPA biosynthesis arranged in five ORFs was also identified in the strain N2AIL. The study provides genomic insights into the diverse genes of Shewanella sp. N2AIL, which is particularly involved in adaptation strategies and prospecting secondary metabolite potential, specifically the biosynthesis of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids.	1
Title: Phenoxy Radical Reactivity of Nucleic Acids: Practical Implications for Biotinylation Abstract: Recent advances in peroxidase-mediated biotin tyramide (BT) signal amplification technology have resulted in high-resolution and subcellular compartment-specific mapping of protein and RNA localization. Horseradish peroxidase (HRP) in the presence of H2 O2 is known to activate phenolic compounds for phenoxy radical reaction with nucleic acids, where biotinylation by BT is a practical example. BT reactivity with RNA and DNA is not understood in detail. We report that BT phenoxy radicals react in a sequence-independent manner with guanosine bases in RNA. In contrast, DNA reactivity with BT cannot be detected by our methods under the same conditions. Remarkably, we show that fluorescein conjugates DNA rapidly and selectively reacts with BT phenoxy radicals, allowing convenient and practical biotinylation of DNA on fluorescein with retention of fluorescence.	0
Title: The stress response protein Gls24 is induced by copper and interacts with the CopZ copper chaperone of Enterococcus hirae Abstract: Intracellular copper routing in Enterococcus hirae is accomplished by the CopZ copper chaperone. Under copper stress, CopZ donates Cu(+) to the CopY repressor, thereby releasing its bound zinc and abolishing repressor-DNA interaction. This in turn induces the expression of the cop operon, which encodes CopY and CopZ, in addition to two copper ATPases, CopA and CopB. To gain further insight into the function of CopZ, the yeast two-hybrid system was used to screen for proteins interacting with the copper chaperone. This led to the identification of Gls24, a member of a family of stress response proteins. Gls24 is part of an operon containing eight genes. The operon was induced by a range of stress conditions, but most notably by copper. Gls24 was overexpressed and purified, and was shown by surface plasmon resonance analysis to also interact with CopZ in vitro. Circular dichroism measurements revealed that Gls24 is partially unstructured. The current findings establish a novel link between Gls24 and copper homeostasis.	0
Title: Bufadienolides from the Eggs of the Toad Bufo bufo gargarizans and Their Antimelanoma Activities Abstract: Toads produce potent toxins, named bufadienolides, to defend against their predators. Pharmacological research has revealed that bufadienolides are potential anticancer drugs. In this research, we reported nine bufadienolides from the eggs of the toad Bufo bufo gargarizans, including two new compounds (1 and 3). The chemical structures of 1 and 3, as well as of one previously reported semisynthesized compound (2), were elucidated on the basis of extensive spectroscopic data interpretation, chemical methods, and X-ray diffraction analysis. Compound 1 is an unusual 19-norbufadienolide with rearranged A/B rings. A biological test revealed that compounds 2 and 4-8 showed potent cytotoxic activities toward human melanoma cell line SK-MEL-1 with IC50 values less than 1.0 μM. A preliminary mechanism investigation revealed that the most potent compound, 8, could induce apoptosis via PARP cleavage, while 5 and 6 significantly suppressed angiogenesis in zebrafish. Furthermore, an in vivo biological study showed that 5, 6, and 8 inhibit SK-MEL-1 cell growth significantly.	0
Title: Identification of the Colicin V Bacteriocin Gene Cluster by Functional Screening of a Human Microbiome Metagenomic Library Abstract: The forces that shape human microbial ecology are complex. It is likely that human microbiota, similarly to other microbiomes, use antibiotics as one way to establish an ecological niche. In this study, we use functional metagenomics to identify human microbial gene clusters that encode for antibiotic functions. Screening of a metagenomic library prepared from a healthy patient stool sample led to the identification of a family of clones with inserts that are 99% identical to a region of a virulence plasmid found in avian pathogenic Escherichia coli. Characterization of the metagenomic DNA sequence identified a colicin V biosynthetic cluster as being responsible for the observed antibiotic effect of the metagenomic clone against E. coli. This study presents a scalable method to recover antibiotic gene clusters from humans using functional metagenomics and highlights a strategy to study bacteriocins in the human microbiome which can provide a resource for therapeutic discovery.	1
Title: Prion nucleation site unmasked by transient interaction with phospholipid cofactor Abstract: Infectious mammalian prions can be formed de novo from purified recombinant prion protein (PrP) substrate through a pathway that requires the sequential addition of 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoglycerol (POPG) and RNA cofactor molecules. Recent studies show that the initial interaction between PrP and POPG causes widespread and persistent conformational changes to form an insoluble intermediate species, termed PrP(Int1). Here, we characterize the mechanism and functional consequences of the interaction between POPG and PrP. Negative-stain electron microscopy of PrP(Int1) revealed the presence of amorphous aggregates. Pull-down and photoaffinity label experiments indicate that POPG induces the formation of a PrP(C) polybasic-domain-binding neoepitope within PrP(Int1). The ongoing presence of POPG is not required to maintain PrP(Int1) structure, as indicated by the absence of stoichiometric levels of POPG in solid-state NMR measurements of PrP(Int1). Together, these results show that a transient interaction with POPG cofactor unmasks a PrP(C) binding site, leading to PrP(Int1) aggregation.	0
Title: Electronic and Steric Control of n→π* Interactions: Stabilization of the α-Helix Conformation without a Hydrogen Bond Abstract: The preferred conformations of peptides and proteins are dependent on local interactions that bias the conformational ensemble. The n→π* interaction between consecutive carbonyls promotes compact conformations, including the α-helix and polyproline II helix. In order to further understand the n→π* interaction and to develop methods to promote defined conformational preferences through acyl N-capping motifs, a series of peptides was synthesized in which the electronic and steric properties of the acyl group were modified. Using NMR spectroscopy, van't Hoff analysis of enthalpies, X-ray crystallography, and computational investigations, we observed that more electron-rich donor carbonyls (pivaloyl, iso-butyryl, propionyl) promote stronger n→π* interactions and more compact conformations than acetyl or less electron-rich donor carbonyls (methoxyacetyl, fluoroacetyl, formyl). X-ray crystallography indicates a strong, electronically tunable preference for the α-helix conformation, as observed directly on the φ and ψ torsion angles. Electron-donating acyl groups promote the α-helical conformation, even in the absence of the hydrogen bonding that stabilizes the α-helix. In contrast, electron-withdrawing acyl groups led to more extended conformations. More sterically demanding groups can promote trans amide bonds independent of the electronic effect on n→π* interactions. Chloroacetyl groups additionally promote n→π* interactions through the interaction of the chlorine lone pair with the proximal carbonyl π*. These data provide additional support for an important role of n→π* interactions in the conformational ensemble of disordered or unfolded proteins. Moreover, this work suggests that readily incorporated acyl N-capping motifs that modulate n→π* interactions may be employed rationally to promote conformational biases in peptides, with potential applications in molecular design and medicinal chemistry.	0
Title: A Dinuclear Mechanism Implicated in Controlled Carbene Polymerization Abstract: Carbene polymerization provides polyolefins that cannot be readily prepared from olefin monomers; however, controlled and living carbene polymerization has been a long-standing challenge. Here we report a new class of initiators, (π-allyl)palladium carboxylate dimers, which polymerize ethyl diazoacetate, a carbene precursor in a controlled and quasi-living manner, with nearly quantitative yields, degrees of polymerization >100, molecular weight dispersities 1.2-1.4, and well-defined, diversifiable chain ends. This method also provides block copolycarbenes that undergo microphase segregation. Experimental and theoretical mechanistic analysis supports a new dinuclear mechanism for this process.	0
Title: In vitro and in vivo production of new aminocoumarins by a combined biochemical, genetic, and synthetic approach Abstract: The aminocoumarin antibiotics clorobiocin, novobiocin, and coumermycin A(1) are inhibitors of bacterial gyrase. Their chemical structures contain amide bonds, formed between an aminocoumarin ring and an aromatic acyl component, which is 3-dimethylallyl-4-hydroxybenzoate in the case of novobiocin and clorobiocin. These amide bonds are formed under catalysis of the gene products of cloL, novL, and couL, respectively. We first examined the substrate specificity of the purified amide synthetases CloL, NovL, and CouL for the various analogs of the prenylated benzoate moiety. We then generated new aminocoumarin antibiotics by feeding synthetic analogs of the 3-dimethylallyl-4-hydroxybenzoate moiety to a mutant strain defective in the biosynthesis of the prenylated benzoate moiety. This resulted in the formation of 32 new aminocoumarin compounds. The structures of these compounds were elucidated using FAB-MS and (1)H-NMR spectroscopy.	1
Title: Production of the Carboxylate Reductase from Nocardia otitidiscaviarum in a Soluble, Active Form for in vitro Applications Abstract: Accessing aldehydes from carboxylate moieties is often a challenging task. In this regard, carboxylate reductases (CARs) are promising catalysts provided by nature that are able to accomplish this task in just one step, avoiding over-reduction to the alcohol product. However, the heterologous expression of CARs can be quite difficult due to the excessive formation of insoluble protein, thus hindering further characterization and application of the enzyme. Here, the heterologous production of the carboxylate reductase from Nocardia otitidiscaviarum (NoCAR) was optimized by a combination of i) optimized cultivation conditions, ii) post-translational modification with a phosphopantetheinyl transferase and iii) selection of an appropriate expression strain. Especially, the selection of Escherichia coli tuner cells as host had a strong effect on the final 110-fold increase in the specific activity of NoCAR. This highly active NoCAR was used to reduce sodium benzoate to benzaldehyde, and it was successfully assembled with an in vitro regeneration of ATP and NADPH, being capable of reducing about 30 mM sodium benzoate with high selectivity in only 2 h of reaction.	0
Title: Complete genome sequence of a marine-derived bacterium Pseudomonas sp. SXM-1 and characterization of its siderophore through antiSMASH analysis and with mass spectroscopic method Abstract: Pseudomonas sp. SXM-1, isolated from coastal sea water of Xiamen Bay, could produce extracellular pyoverdine. Here, we present the complete genome of Pseudomonas sp. SXM-1, which will facilitate the genome mining of the pyoverdine synthetase coding gene cluster. The sequenced genome, a circular chromosome, is 7,226,716 bp in length, which contains 60.78% of GC bases, 6549 proteins, 67 tRNAs, and 16 rRNA encoding genes. The structure of pyoverdine produced by Pseudomonas sp. SXM-1 was predicted by using the antiSMASH 5.1.2 tool and further characterized with mass spectroscopic method.	1
Title: Characterization of Heronamide Biosynthesis Reveals a Tailoring Hydroxylase and Indicates Migrated Double Bonds Abstract: Heronamides belong to a growing family of β-amino acid polyketide macrolactams (βPMs) with an unsaturated side chain. The biosynthetic gene cluster for heronamide F was identified from the deep-sea-derived Streptomyces sp. SCSIO 03032. The involvement of the gene cluster in heronamide biosynthesis was confirmed by the functional characterization of the P450 enzyme HerO as an 8-hydroxylase for tailoring heronamide biosynthesis. The presence of migrated double bonds in the conjugated diene-containing side chain of heronamides was confirmed by feeding experiments with labeled small carboxylic acid molecules. This study is the first demonstration of migrated double bonds in βPMs with an unsaturated side chain.	1
Title: Cloning and characterization of a polyketide synthase gene from Streptomyces fradiae Tü2717, which carries the genes for biosynthesis of the angucycline antibiotic urdamycin A and a gene probably involved in its oxygenation Abstract: A DNA fragment was cloned as cosmid purd8, which encodes a polyketide synthase involved in the production of the angucycline antibiotic urdamycin from Streptomyces fradiae Tü2717. Deletion of the polyketide synthase genes from the chromosome abolished urdamycin production. In addition, purd8 conferred urdamycin resistance on introduction into Streptomyces lividans TK24. Sequence analysis of 5.7 kb of purd8 revealed six open reading frames transcribed in the same direction. The deduced amino acid sequences of the six open reading frames strongly resemble proteins from known type II polyketide synthase gene clusters: a ketoacyl synthase, a chain length factor, an acyl carrier protein, a ketoreductase, a cyclase, and an oxygenase. Heterologous expression of the urdamycin genes encoding a ketoacyl synthase and a chain length factor in Streptomyces glaucescens tetracenomycin C-nonproducing mutants impaired in either the TcmK ketoacyl synthase or TcmL chain length factor resulted in the production of tetracenomycin C. Heterologous expression of a putative oxygenase gene from the urdamycin gene cluster in S. glaucescens GLA.O caused production of the hybrid antibiotic 6-hydroxy tetracenomycin C.	1
Title: De novo design of protein mimics of B-DNA Abstract: Structural mimicry of DNA is utilized in nature as a strategy to evade molecular defences mounted by host organisms. One such example is the protein Ocr - the first translation product to be expressed as the bacteriophage T7 infects E. coli. The structure of Ocr reveals an intricate and deliberate arrangement of negative charges that endows it with the ability to mimic ∼24 base pair stretches of B-DNA. This uncanny resemblance to DNA enables Ocr to compete in binding the type I restriction modification (R/M) system, and neutralizes the threat of hydrolytic cleavage of viral genomic material. Here, we report the de novo design and biophysical characterization of DNA mimicking peptides, and describe the inhibitory action of the designed helical bundles on a type I R/M enzyme, EcoR124I. This work validates the use of charge patterning as a design principle for creation of protein mimics of DNA, and serves as a starting point for development of therapeutic peptide inhibitors against human pathogens that employ molecular camouflage as part of their invasion stratagem.	0
Title: Dissecting glycosylation steps in lobophorin biosynthesis implies an iterative glycosyltransferase Abstract: The identification of a lobophorin biosynthetic gene cluster from the deep-sea derived Streptomyces sp. SCSIO 01127 reveals a paradigm of three glycosyltransferases (GTs) LobG1-LobG3 being responsible for appending four sugars. Characterization of five differentially glycosylated metabolites from three GT gene-inactivation mutants allowed the assignment of GT functions and the implication of LobG3 as an iterative GT to attach two digitoxoses.	1
Title: Genome sequencing and analysis of the filamentous fungus Penicillium chrysogenum Abstract: Industrial penicillin production with the filamentous fungus Penicillium chrysogenum is based on an unprecedented effort in microbial strain improvement. To gain more insight into penicillin synthesis, we sequenced the 32.19 Mb genome of P. chrysogenum Wisconsin54-1255 and identified numerous genes responsible for key steps in penicillin production. DNA microarrays were used to compare the transcriptomes of the sequenced strain and a penicillinG high-producing strain, grown in the presence and absence of the side-chain precursor phenylacetic acid. Transcription of genes involved in biosynthesis of valine, cysteine and alpha-aminoadipic acid-precursors for penicillin biosynthesis-as well as of genes encoding microbody proteins, was increased in the high-producing strain. Some gene products were shown to be directly controlling beta-lactam output. Many key cellular transport processes involving penicillins and intermediates remain to be characterized at the molecular level. Genes predicted to encode transporters were strongly overrepresented among the genes transcriptionally upregulated under conditions that stimulate penicillinG production, illustrating potential for future genomics-driven metabolic engineering.	1
Title: Saturation mutagenesis of selected residues of the α-peptide of the lantibiotic lacticin 3147 yields a derivative with enhanced antimicrobial activity Abstract: The lantibiotic lacticin 3147 consists of two ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified antimicrobial peptides, Ltnα and Ltnβ, which act synergistically against a wide range of Gram-positive microorganisms. We performed saturation mutagenesis of specific residues of Ltnα to determine their functional importance. The results establish that Ltnα is more tolerant to change than previously suggested by alanine scanning mutagenesis. One substitution, LtnαH23S, was identified which improved the specific activity of lacticin 3147 against one pathogenic strain, Staphylococcus aureus NCDO1499. This represents the first occasion upon which the activity of a two peptide lantibiotic has been enhanced through bioengineering.	1
Title: RNA architecture dictates the conformations of a bound peptide Abstract: Background:                       The biological function of several viral and bacteriophage proteins, and their arginine-rich subdomains, involves RNA-mediated interactions. It has been shown recently that bound peptides adopt either beta-hairpin or alpha-helical conformations in viral and phage peptide-RNA complexes. We have compared the structures of the arginine-rich peptide domain of HIV-1 Rev bound to two RNA aptamers to determine whether RNA architecture can dictate the conformations of a bound peptide.                  Results:                       The core-binding segment of the HIV-1 Rev peptide class II RNA aptamer complex spans the two-base bulge and hairpin loop of the bound RNA and the carboxy-terminal segment of the bound peptide. The bound peptide is anchored in place by backbone and sidechain intermolecular hydrogen bonding and van der Waals stacking interactions. One of the bulge bases participates in U*(A*U) base triple formation, whereas the other is looped out and flaps over the bound peptide in the complex. The seven-residue hairpin loop is closed by a sheared G*A mismatch pair with several pyrimidines looped out of the hairpin fold.                  Conclusions:                       Our structural studies establish that RNA architecture dictates whether the same HIV-1 Rev peptide folds into an extended or alpha-helical conformation on complex formation. Arginine-rich peptides can therefore adapt distinct secondary folds to complement the tertiary folds of their RNA targets. This contrasts with protein-RNA complexes in which elements of RNA secondary structure adapt to fit within the tertiary folds of their protein targets.	0
Title: Engineering robust microorganisms for organic acid production Abstract: Organic acids are an important class of compounds that can be produced by microbial conversion of renewable feedstocks and have huge demands and broad applications in food, chemical, and pharmaceutical industries. An economically viable fermentation process for production of organic acids requires robust microbial cell factories with excellent tolerance to low pH conditions, high concentrations of organic acids, and lignocellulosic inhibitors. In this review, we summarize various strategies to engineer robust microorganisms for organic acid production and highlight their applications in a few recent examples.	0
Title: Chromogenic identification of genetic regulatory signals in Bacillus subtilis based on expression of a cloned Pseudomonas gene Abstract: A method to isolate fragments of DNA that promote gene expression in Bacillus subtilis is described. The system is based on production of catechol 2,3-dioxygenase [CatO2ase; catechol:oxygen 2,3-oxidoreductase (decyclizing), EC 1.13.11.2] encoded by the Pseudomonas putida TOL plasmid gene xylE. The gene was transferred to aB. subtilis/Escherichia coli plasmid vector to construct pTG402. Although xylE is functionally expressed in E. coli, CatO2ase is not detected in B. subtilis unless a fragment of DNA capable of promoting gene expression is ligated into a cleavage site on pTG402 upstream from xylE. Fragments of chromosomal DNA from B. subtilis, Bacillus licheniformis, Bacillus pumilus, and E. coli are shown to promote xylE gene expression in B. subtilis. The special feature of the system is the method of detection: colonies of cells that express xylE become yellow within seconds after selection plates are sprayed with catechol, a colorless substrate that is converted by CatO2ase to the yellow product, 2-hydroxymuconic semialdehyde. The complete nucleotide sequence of xylE is presented. Strong complementarity between the ribosome binding site and 16S rRNA suggests that xylE mRNA translation in B. subtilis may commence at the same site as that recognized by P. putida. Identity of CatO2ase produced in B. subtilis, E. coli, and P. putida support the hypothesis. Our sensitive color assay offers an approach to develop plasmid gene expression vectors for a wide variety of host organisms.	0
Title: Characterization of the gene cluster responsible for cylindrospermopsin biosynthesis Abstract: Toxic cyanobacterial blooms cause economic losses and pose significant public health threats on a global scale. Characterization of the gene cluster for the biosynthesis of the cyanobacterial toxin cylindrospermopsin (cyr) in Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii AWT205 is described, and the complete biosynthetic pathway is proposed. The cyr gene cluster spans 43 kb and is comprised of 15 open reading frames containing genes required for the biosynthesis, regulation, and export of the toxin. Biosynthesis is initiated via an amidinotransfer onto glycine followed by five polyketide extensions and subsequent reductions, and rings are formed via Michael additions in a stepwise manner. The uracil ring is formed by a novel pyrimidine biosynthesis mechanism and tailoring reactions, including sulfation and hydroxylation that complete biosynthesis. These findings enable the design of toxic strain-specific probes and allow the future study of the regulation and biological role of cylindrospermopsin.	1
Title: Nodularin, a cyanobacterial toxin, is synthesized in planta by symbiotic Nostoc sp Abstract: The nitrogen-fixing bacterium, Nostoc, is a commonly occurring cyanobacterium often found in symbiotic associations. We investigated the potential of cycad cyanobacterial endosymbionts to synthesize microcystin/nodularin. Endosymbiont DNA was screened for the aminotransferase domain of the toxin biosynthesis gene clusters. Five endosymbionts carrying the gene were screened for bioactivity. Extracts of two isolates inhibited protein phosphatase 2A and were further analyzed using electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS)/MS. Nostoc sp. 'Macrozamia riedlei 65.1' and Nostoc sp. 'Macrozamia serpentina 73.1' both contained nodularin. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) HESI-MS/MS analysis confirmed the presence of nodularin at 9.55±2.4 ng μg-1 chlorophyll a in Nostoc sp. 'Macrozamia riedlei 65.1' and 12.5±8.4 ng μg-1 Chl a in Nostoc sp. 'Macrozamia serpentina 73.1' extracts. Further scans indicated the presence of the rare isoform [L-Har(2)] nodularin, which contains L-homoarginine instead of L-arginine. Nodularin was also present at 1.34±0.74 ng ml(-1) (approximately 3 pmol per g plant ww) in the methanol root extracts of M. riedlei MZ65, while the presence of [L-Har(2)] nodularin in the roots of M. serpentina MZ73 was suggested by HPLC HESI-MS/MS analysis. The ndaA-B and ndaF genomic regions were sequenced to confirm the presence of the hybrid polyketide/non-ribosomal gene cluster. A seven amino-acid insertion into the NdaA-C1 domain of N. spumigena NSOR10 protein was observed in all endosymbiont-derived sequences, suggesting the transfer of the nda cluster from N. spumigena to terrestrial Nostoc species. This study demonstrates the synthesis of nodularin and [L-Har(2)] nodularin in a non-Nodularia species and the production of cyanobacterial hepatotoxin by a symbiont in planta.	1
Title: Regio- and stereoselective intermolecular oxidative phenol coupling in Streptomyces Abstract: Intermolecular oxidative phenol coupling is the main process in nature for the formation of atroposelective biaryl compounds. Although well defined in plants and fungi, this type of dimerization reaction in bacteria is poorly understood. Therefore, the biosynthesis of julichromes, spectomycins, and setomimycin was investigated. The monomeric subunits of these biarylic pre-anthraquinones are derived from a common polyketidic precursor, yet the coupling reaction proceeds in a regioselective manner, with the position of attachment of the two subunits depending on the specific streptomycete strain. By using genome analysis and deletion experiments, the biosynthetic gene clusters were identified. Furthermore, it was established that cytochrome P450 enzymes are fundamentally involved during dimerization of the polyketide monomers.	1
Title: A Zn(II)2Cys6 DNA binding protein regulates the sirodesmin PL biosynthetic gene cluster in Leptosphaeria maculans Abstract: A gene, sirZ, encoding a Zn(II)(2)Cys(6) DNA binding protein is present in a cluster of genes responsible for the biosynthesis of the epipolythiodioxopiperazine (ETP) toxin, sirodesmin PL in the ascomycete plant pathogen, Leptosphaeria maculans. RNA-mediated silencing of sirZ gives rise to transformants that produce only residual amounts of sirodesmin PL and display a decrease in the transcription of several sirodesmin PL biosynthetic genes. This indicates that SirZ is a major regulator of this gene cluster. Proteins similar to SirZ are encoded in the gliotoxin biosynthetic gene cluster of Aspergillus fumigatus (gliZ) and in an ETP-like cluster in Penicillium lilacinoechinulatum (PlgliZ). Despite its high level of sequence similarity to gliZ, PlgliZ is unable to complement the gliotoxin-deficiency of a mutant of gliZ in A. fumigatus. Putative binding sites for these regulatory proteins in the promoters of genes in these clusters were predicted using bioinformatic analysis. These sites are similar to those commonly bound by other proteins with Zn(II)(2)Cys(6) DNA binding domains.	1
Title: Synthesis and pharmacological effects of the enantiomers of the N-phenethyl analogues of the ortho and para e- and f-oxide-bridged phenylmorphans Abstract: The N-phenethyl analogues of (1R*,4aR*,9aS*)-2-phenethyl-1,3,4,9a-tetrahydro-2H-1,4a-propanobenzofuro[2,3-c]pyridin-6-ol and 8-ol and (1R*,4aR*,9aR*)-2-phenethyl-1,3,4,9a-tetrahydro-2H-1,4a-propanobenzofuro[2.3-c]pyridin-6-ol and 8-ol, the ortho- (43) and para-hydroxy e- (20), and f-oxide-bridged 5-phenylmorphans (53 and 26) were prepared in racemic and enantiomerically pure forms from a common precursor, the quaternary salt 12. Optical resolutions were accomplished by salt formation with suitable enantiomerically pure chiral acids or by preparative HPLC on a chiral support. The N-phenethyl (-)- para-e enantiomer (1S,4aS,9aR-(-)-20) was found to be a mu-opioid agonist with morphine-like antinociceptive activity in a mouse assay. In contrast, the N-phenethyl (-)-ortho-f enantiomer (1R,4aR,9aR-(-)-53) had good affinity for the mu-opioid receptor (K(i) = 7 nM) and was found to be a mu-antagonist both in the [(35)S]GTP-gamma-S assay and in vivo. The molecular structures of these rigid enantiomers were energy minimized with density functional theory at the level B3LYP/6-31G* level, and then overlaid on a known potent mu-agonist. This superposition study suggests that the agonist activity of the oxide-bridged 5-phenylmorphans can be attributed to formation of a seven membered ring that is hypothesized to facilitate a proton transfer from the protonated nitrogen to a proton acceptor in the mu-opioid receptor.	0
Title: Fluorescence imaging of single-copy DNA sequences within the human genome using PNA-directed padlock probe assembly Abstract: We present an approach for fluorescent in situ detection of short, single-copy sequences within genomic DNA in human cells. The single-copy sensitivity and single-base specificity of our method is achieved due to the combination of three components. First, a peptide nucleic acid (PNA) probe locally opens a chosen target site, which allows a padlock DNA probe to access the site and become ligated. Second, rolling circle amplification (RCA) generates thousands of single-stranded copies of the target sequence. Finally, fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) is used to visualize the amplified DNA. We validate this technique by successfully detecting six single-copy target sites on human mitochondrial and autosomal DNA. We also demonstrate the high selectivity of this method by detecting X- and Y-specific sequences on human sex chromosomes and by simultaneously detecting three sequence-specific target sites. Finally, we discriminate two target sites that differ by 2 nt. The PNA-RCA-FISH approach is a distinctive in situ hybridization method capable of multitarget visualization within human chromosomes and nuclei that does not require DNA denaturation and is extremely sequence specific.	0
Title: Optimization of growth media components for polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) production from organic acids by Ralstonia eutropha Abstract: We employed systematic mixture analysis to determine optimal levels of acetate, propionate, and butyrate for cell growth and polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) production by Ralstonia eutropha H16. Butyrate was the preferred acid for robust cell growth and high PHA production. The 3-hydroxyvalerate content in the resulting PHA depended on the proportion of propionate initially present in the growth medium. The proportion of acetate dramatically affected the final pH of the growth medium. A model was constructed using our data that predicts the effects of these acids, individually and in combination, on cell dry weight (CDW), PHA content (%CDW), PHA production, 3HV in the polymer, and final culture pH. Cell growth and PHA production improved approximately 1.5-fold over initial conditions when the proportion of butyrate was increased. Optimization of the phosphate buffer content in medium containing higher amounts of butyrate improved cell growth and PHA production more than 4-fold. The validated organic acid mixture analysis model can be used to optimize R. eutropha culture conditions, in order to meet targets for PHA production and/or polymer HV content. By modifying the growth medium made from treated industrial waste, such as palm oil mill effluent, more PHA can be produced.	0
Title: Evolution of siderophore pathways in human pathogenic bacteria Abstract: Ornibactin and malleobactin are hydroxamate siderophores employed by human pathogenic bacteria belonging to the genus Burkholderia. Similarities in their structures and corresponding biosynthesis gene clusters strongly suggest an evolutionary relationship. Through gene coexpression and targeted gene manipulations, the malleobactin pathway was successfully morphed into an ornibactin assembly line. Such an evolutionary-guided approach has been unprecedented for nonribosomal peptide synthetases. Furthermore, the timing of amino acid acylation before peptide assembly, the absolute configuration of the ornibactin side chain, and the function of the acyl transferase were elucidated. Beyond providing a proof of principle for the rational design of siderophore pathways, a compelling model for the evolution of virulence traits is presented.	1
Title: Transcriptional organization of a cloned chemotaxis locus of Bacillus subtilis Abstract: A cloned chemotaxis operon has been characterized. Thirteen representative che mutations from different complementation groups were localized on the physical map by recombination experiments. The use of integration plasmids established that at least 10 of these complementation groups within this locus are cotranscribed. An additional three complementation groups may form part of the same transcript. The direction of transcription and the time of expression were determined from chromosomal che-lacZ gene fusions. The promoter was cloned and localized to a 3-kilobase fragment. Expression of beta-galactosidase from this promoter was observed primarily during the logarithmic phase of growth. Three-factor PBS1 cotransduction experiments were performed to order the che locus with respect to adjacent markers. The cheF141 mutation is 70 to 80% linked to pyrD1. This linkage is different from that reported previously (G. W. Ordal, D. O. Nettleton, and J. A. Hoch, J. Bacteriol. 154:1088-1097, 1983). The cheM127 mutation is 57% linked by transformation to spcB3. The gene order determined from all crosses is pyrD-cheF-cheM-spcB.	0
Title: Cross-species hybridization of a Borrelia burgdorferi DNA array reveals infection- and culture-associated genes of the unsequenced genome of the relapsing fever agent Borrelia hermsii Abstract: The known genome sequence of Borrelia burgdorferi, an agent of Lyme borreliosis, was used to study the genetic content and gene expression in B. hermsii, another spirochete pathogen and a cause of relapsing fever. Cross-species hybridization of a DNA array representing 1628 open reading frames (ORF) of B. burgdorferi with genomic DNA of B. hermsii indicated that the latter organism has at least 81% of the chromosomal genes and 43% of the plasmid genes of B. burgdorferi. We then carried out quantitative hybridization of the arrays with multiple replicates of cDNA produced from B. hermsii cells growing in the blood of infected mice or in culture medium that was adjusted to the same pH, temperature and a spirochete density as infected blood. Of 642 B. burgdorferi ORFs hybridized by all replicates under both conditions, 12 (1.9%) demonstrated differential expression by a regularized t-test and stringent criteria. BBP07 and BBG30, two plasmid-borne ORFs with the greatest measurable difference in expression between in vivo and in vitro conditions, putatively encode proteins of unknown function. Orthologues of BBP07 in B. hermsii were identified, and increased expression in infected mice was demonstrated by quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction.	0
Title: Performance and microbial community variations of anaerobic digesters under increasing tetracycline concentrations Abstract: The impact of different concentrations of tetracycline on the performance of anaerobic treatment was evaluated. Results revealed that for all of the tested tetracycline concentrations, no major sustained impact on methane production was observed. Instead, a significant increase in propionic acid was observed in the reactor subjected to the highest concentration of tetracycline (20 mg/L). Microbial community analyses suggest that an alternative methanogenic pathway, specifically that of methanol-utilizing methanogens, may be important for ensuring the stability of methane production in the presence of high tetracycline concentrations. In addition, the accumulation of propionate was due to an increase in volatile fatty acids (VFA)-producing bacteria coupled with a reduction in propionate utilizers. An increase in the abundance of tetracycline resistance genes associated with ribosomal protection proteins was observed after 30 days of exposure to high concentrations of tetracycline, while other targeted resistance genes showed no significant changes. These findings suggest that anaerobic treatment processes can robustly treat wastewater with varying concentrations of antibiotics while also deriving value-added products and minimizing the dissemination of associated antibiotic resistance genes.	0
Title: IS1675, a novel lactococcal insertion element, forms a transposon-like structure including the lacticin 481 lantibiotic operon Abstract: Two copies of IS1675, a novel lactococcal insertion element from the IS4 family, are present on a 70-kb plasmid, where they frame the lantibiotic lacticin 481 operon. The whole structure could be a composite transposon designated Tn5721. This study shows that the lacticin 481 operon does not include any regulatory gene and provides a new example of a transposon-associated bacteriocin determinant. We identified five other IS1675 copies not associated with the lacticin 481 operon. The conservation of IS1675 flanking sequences suggested a 24-bp target site.	1
Title: Methyltransferase Contingencies in the Pathway of Everninomicin D Antibiotics and Analogues Abstract: Everninomicins are orthoester oligosaccharide antibiotics with potent activity against multidrug-resistant bacterial pathogens. Everninomicins act by disrupting ribosomal assembly in a distinct region in comparison to clinically prescribed drugs. We employed microporous intergeneric conjugation with Escherichia coli to manipulate Micromonospora for targeted gene-replacement studies of multiple putative methyltransferases across the octasaccharide scaffold of everninomicin effecting the A1 , C, F, and H rings. Analyses of gene-replacement and genetic complementation mutants established the mutability of the everninomicin scaffold through the generation of 12 previously unreported analogues and, together with previous results, permitted assignment of the ten methyltransferases required for everninomicin biosynthesis. The in vitro activity of A1 - and H-ring-modifying methyltransferases demonstrated the ability to catalyze late-stage modification of the scaffold on an A1 -ring phenol and H-ring C-4' hydroxy moiety. Together these results establish the potential of the everninomicin scaffold for modification through mutagenesis and in vitro modification of advanced biosynthetic intermediates.	1
Title: Elucidation of a carotenoid biosynthesis gene cluster encoding a novel enzyme, 2,2'-beta-hydroxylase, from Brevundimonas sp. strain SD212 and combinatorial biosynthesis of new or rare xanthophylls Abstract: A carotenoid biosynthesis gene cluster mediating the production of 2-hydroxyastaxanthin was isolated from the marine bacterium Brevundimonas sp. strain SD212 by using a common crtI sequence as the probe DNA. A sequence analysis revealed this cluster to contain 12 open reading frames (ORFs), including the 7 known genes, crtW, crtY, crtI, crtB, crtE, idi, and crtZ. The individual ORFs were functionally analyzed by complementation studies using Escherichia coli that accumulated various carotenoid precursors due to the presence of other bacterial crt genes. In addition to functionally identifying the known crt genes, we found that one (ORF11, named crtG) coded for a novel enzyme, carotenoid 2,2'-beta-hydroxylase, which showed intriguingly partial homology with animal sterol-C5-desaturase. When this crtG gene was introduced into E. coli accumulating zeaxanthin and canthaxanthin, the resulting transformants produced their 2-hydroxylated and 2,2'-dihydroxylated products which were structurally novel or rare xanthophylls, as determined by their nuclear magnetic resonance and high-performance liquid chromatography/photodiode array detector/atmospheric pressure chemical ionization mass spectrometry spectral data. The new carotenoid produced was suggested to have a strong inhibitory effect on lipid peroxidation.	1
Title: Real-time imaging of surface chemical reactions by electrochemical photothermal reflectance microscopy Abstract: Traditional electrochemical measurements based on either current or potential responses only present the average contribution of an entire electrode's surface. Here, we present an electrochemical photothermal reflectance microscope (EPRM) in which a potential-dependent nonlinear photothermal signal is exploited to map an electrochemical process with sub-micron spatial resolution. By using EPRM, we are able to monitor the photothermal signal of a Pt electrode during the electrochemical reaction at an imaging speed of 0.3 s per frame. The potential-dependent photothermal signal, which is sensitive to the free electron density, clearly revealed the evolution of surface species on the Pt surface. Our results agreed well with the reported spectroelectrochemical techniques under similar conditions but with a much faster imaging speed. We further mapped the potential oscillation during the oxidation of formic acid on the Pt surface. The photothermal images from the Pt electrode well matched the potential change. This technique opens new prospects for real-time imaging of surface chemical reaction to reveal the heterogeneity of electrochemical reactivity, which enables broad applications to the study of catalysis, energy storage, and light harvest systems.	0
Title: FW0622, a new siderophore isolated from marine Verrucosispora sp. by genomic mining Abstract: Using the draft genome sequence of Verrucosispora sp. FIM060022, we have identified a new desferrioxamine-like siderophore, FW0622. This is the first chemically characterized siderophore obtained from Verrucosispora. The structure was elucidated by extensive spectral analyses. The biosynthetic pathway of FW0622 was proposed to occur via the non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS)-independent (NIS) synthetase pathway based on the putative biosynthetic siderophore gene cluster in FIM060022. The results demonstrate that marine-derived Verrucosispora species deserve recognition as an important source of new natural products. Furthermore, this study verified that genome mining is an effective way to identify compounds that may be overlooked by traditional methods.	1
Title: Structural analysis of a non-ribosomal halogenated cyclic peptide and its putative operon from Microcystis: implications for evolution of cyanopeptolins Abstract: The structure of the major peptide produced by Microcystis cf. wesenbergii NIVA-CYA 172/5, the halogenated heptapeptide cyanopeptolin-984, was determined using LC/MS/MS. A gene cluster encoding a peptide synthetase putatively producing a cyanopeptolin was cloned from the same strain and sequenced. The cluster consists of four genes encoding peptide synthetases and one gene encoding a halogenase. Two additional ORFs transcribed in the opposite direction were found in the 5' flanking sequence; one of these encodes an ABC transporter. The overall organization of the cyanopeptolin synthetase operon (mcn) resembles a previously analysed anabaenopeptilide synthetase operon (apd) from Anabaena strain 90. Phylogenetic analyses of the individual domains from Mcn, Apd and other cyanobacterial peptide synthetases showed clustering of the adenylation domains according to function irrespective of operon origin - indicating strong functional constraints across peptide synthetases. In contrast, the condensation and thiolation domains to a large extent grouped according to operon affiliation or position in the respective operons. Phylogenetic analyses of condensation domains indicated that N-terminal domains and domains that condense L-amino acids and D-amino acids, respectively, form three separate groups. Although recombination events are likely to be involved in the evolution of mcn, no clear evidence of genetic recombination between the two cyanopeptolin gene clusters was found. Within the genus Microcystis, microcystin and cyanopeptolin synthetases have an evolutionary history of genomic coexistence. However, the data indicated that the two classes of peptide synthetase gene clusters have evolved independently.	1
Title: Isolation and biochemical characterization of a novel lantibiotic mutacin from Streptococcus mutans Abstract: Certain members of the indigenous biota of humans produce antimicrobial substances called bacteriocins, which inhibit other bacteria, including members of their own species. One of these substances, mutacin, is made by Streptococcus mutans, a member of the oral biota. Mutacin inhibits other mutans streptococci as well as many gram-positive exogenous pathogens. Here, we report for the first time the purification and partial biochemical characterization of a lanthionine-containing mutacin peptide from S. mutants T8. The biologically active peptide was isolated from the broth cultures by ultrafiltration and differential precipitation. The final mutacin preparation was homogeneous as shown by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and N-terminal amino acid sequencing. A molecular mass of the peptide was estimated by electrospray ionization mass spectroscopy to be 3,244.64 +/- 1.15 Da. Its amino acid composition indicates the presence of lanthionine and likely beta-methyllanthionine in a total of about 25 amino acids. Because alpha,beta-unsaturated amino acids, the precursors of lanthionine residues, are often found in lantibiotics, we carried out the addition reaction of the mutacin with N-(methyl)mercaptoacetamide. The subsequent electrospray ionization mass spectroscopy analysis indicated the presence of two reaction products with M(r)s of 3,350.45 and 3,456.0. These are interpreted as the mutacin molecule with the addition of one and two molecules of reagent to the unsaturated amino acids, respectively. Sequencing of the peptide revealed an N-terminal amino acid sequence of Asn-Arg-Trp-Trp-Gln-Gly-Val-Val.	1
Title: Sequence-universal recognition of duplex DNA by oligonucleotides via pseudocomplementarity and helix invasion Abstract: The well-known Watson-Crick complementarity rules, which were discovered 50 years ago, elegantly direct the specific pairing of two DNA single strands. On the contrary, once formed, the double-stranded (ds) DNA lacks such a simple and sequence-universal recognition principle, since most of the characteristic chemical groups of nucleobases are now buried deep inside the double helix, the major DNA form. We report a promising versatile approach for highly selective recognition of designated sites within dsDNA featuring considerable practical potential for a variety of molecular-biological, biotechnological, gene-therapeutic, and diagnostic applications. It may also have implications for prebiotic evolution of genetic machinery at the primordial stages of the origin of life. Our design synergistically employs the robust helix-invasion ability of recently developed DNA mimics and analogs, pseudocomplementary peptide nucleic acids and pseudocomplementary oligonucleotides, thus enabling the sequence-unrestricted recognition of chosen DNA duplexes by nucleobase oligomers. Using this basically general approach, we selectively tagged a unique mixed-base site on the target dsDNA fragment with streptavidin and/or multiply labeled this site with fluorophores via the primer-extension reaction.	0
Title: Identification of a Mycobacterium tuberculosis gene cluster encoding the biosynthetic enzymes for assembly of the virulence-conferring siderophore mycobactin Abstract: Background:                       Many pathogenic bacteria secrete iron-chelating siderophores as virulence factors in the iron-limiting environments of their vertebrate hosts to compete for ferric iron. Mycobacterium tuberculosis mycobactins are mixed polyketide/nonribosomal peptides that contain a hydroxyaryloxazoline cap and two N-hydroxyamides that together create a high-affinity site for ferric ion. The mycobactin structure is analogous to that of the yersiniabactin and vibriobactin siderophores from the bacteria that cause plague and cholera, respectively.                  Results:                       A ten-gene cluster spanning 24 kilobases of the M. tuberculosis genome, designated mbtA-J, contains the core components necessary for mycobactin biogenesis. The gene products MbtB, MbtE and MbtF are proposed to be peptide synthetases, MbtC and MbtD polyketide synthases, MbtI an isochorismate synthase that provides a salicylate activated by MbtA, and MbtG a required hydroxylase. An aryl carrier protein (ArCP) domain is encoded in mbtB, and is probably the site of siderophore chain initiation. Overproduction and purification of the mbtB ArCP domain and MbtA in Escherichia coli allowed validation of the mycobactin initiation hypothesis, as sequential action of PptT (a phosphopantetheinyl transferase) and MbtA (a salicyl-AMP ligase) resulted in the mbtB ArCP domain being activated as salicyl-S-ArCP.                  Conclusions:                       Mycobactins are produced in M. tuberculosis using a polyketide synthase/nonribosomal peptide synthetase strategy. The mycobactin gene cluster has organizational homologies to the yersiniabactin and enterobactin synthetase genes. Enzymatic targets for inhibitor design and therapeutic intervention are suggested by the similar ferric-ion ligation strategies used in the siderophores from Mycobacteria, Yersinia and E. coli pathogens.	1
Title: Characterization of the two-component, FAD-dependent monooxygenase SgcC that requires carrier protein-tethered substrates for the biosynthesis of the enediyne antitumor antibiotic C-1027 Abstract: C-1027 is a potent antitumor antibiotic composed of an apoprotein (CagA) and a reactive enediyne chromophore. The chromophore has four distinct chemical moieties, including an ( S)-3-chloro-5-hydroxy-beta-tyrosine moiety, the biosynthesis of which from l-alpha-tyrosine requires five proteins: SgcC, SgcC1, SgcC2, SgcC3, and SgcC4; a sixth protein, SgcC5, catalyzes the incorporation of this beta-amino acid moiety into C-1027. Biochemical characterization of SgcC has now revealed that (i) SgcC is a two-component, flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD)-dependent monooxygenase, (ii) SgcC is only active with SgcC2 (peptidyl carrier protein)-tethered substrates, (iii) SgcC-catalyzed hydroxylation requires O 2 and FADH 2, the latter supplied by the C-1027 pathway-specific flavin reductase SgcE6 or Escherichia coli flavin reductase Fre, and (iv) SgcC efficiently catalyzes regioselective hydroxylation of 3-substituted beta-tyrosyl-S-SgcC2 analogues, including the chloro-, bromo-, iodo-, fluoro-, and methyl-substituted analogues, but does not accept 3-hydroxy-beta-tyrosyl-S-SgcC2 as a substrate. Together with the in vitro data for SgcC4, SgcC1, and SgcC3, the results establish that SgcC catalyzes the hydroxylation of ( S)-3-chloro-beta-tyrosyl-S-SgcC2 as the final step in the biosynthesis of the ( S)-3-chloro-5-hydroxy-beta-tyrosine moiety prior to incorporation into C-1027. SgcC now represents the first biochemically characterized two-component, FAD-dependent monooxygenase that acts on a carrier-protein-tethered aromatic substrate.	1
Title: Fluorous synthesis of hydantoins and thiohydantoins Abstract: [reaction: see text] A fluorous synthesis of hydantoins is introduced. The reaction of perfluoroalkyl (Rfh)-tagged amino esters with an isocyanate is followed by the cyclization of ureas and simultaneous cleavage of the fluorous tag to afford hydantoins. The product purification is performed by solid-phase extraction over FluoroFlash cartridges, and no fluorous solvent is involved in either the reaction or the separation processes. The same method applies to synthesis of thiohydantoins.	0
Title: Involvement of a chromomycin ABC transporter system in secretion of a deacetylated precursor during chromomycin biosynthesis Abstract: Chromomycin A(3) is an antitumour antibiotic that acts by inhibiting transcription and replication of DNA. The producer micro-organism Streptomyces griseus subsp. griseus is highly resistant to chromomycin A(3) and to the structurally related compound mithramycin upon induction with chromomycin A(3). The biosynthetic gene cluster of chromomycin contains three genes involved in self-resistance to chromomycin in S. griseus: cmrA and cmrB encode a type I ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter, and cmrX encodes a UvrA-like protein of ABC excision nuclease systems. These genes are linked in the chromosome, together with a gene encoding a transcriptional repressor (cmmRII). Involvement of these genes in chromomycin resistance was determined through gene inactivation, and heterologous expression in Streptomyces albus. Inactivation of cmrX produced a chromomycin-sensitive low-producer strain, while inactivation of cmmRII generated a high-chromomycin-producer strain, which was resistant to chromomycin, and also to mithramycin. Expression of either cmrA and cmrB, or cmrX, in S. albus generated strains with low chromomycin resistance; it was therefore necessary to co-express the three genes to achieve high levels of resistance. However, the CmrAB ABC transporter conferred a high level of resistance to the biosynthesis intermediate 4A,4E-O-dideacetyl-chromomycin A(3). A model is proposed for the biosynthesis of, and self-resistance to, chromomycin A(3) in S. griseus subsp. griseus.	1
Title: Targeted gene inactivation for the elucidation of deoxysugar biosynthesis in the erythromycin producer Saccharopolyspora erythraea Abstract: The production of erythromycin A by Saccharopolyspora erythraea requires the synthesis of dTDP-D-desosamine and dTDP-L-mycarose, which serve as substrates for the transfer of the two sugar residues onto the macrolactone ring. The enzymatic activities involved in this process are largely encoded within the ery gene cluster, by two sets of genes flanking the eryA locus that encodes the polyketide synthase. We report here the nucleotide sequence of three such ORFs located immediately downstream of eryA, ORFs 7, 8 and 9. Chromosomal mutants carrying a deletion either in ORF7 or in one of the previously sequenced ORFs 13 and 14 have been constructed and shown to accumulate erythronolide B, as expected for eryB mutants. Similarly, chromosomal mutants carrying a deletion in either ORF8, ORF9, or one of the previously sequenced ORFs 17 and 18 have been constructed and shown to accumulate 3-alpha-mycarosyl erythronolide B, as expected for eryC mutants. The ORF13 (eryBIV), ORF17 (eryCIV) and ORF7 (eryBII) mutants also synthesised small amounts of macrolide shunt metabolites, as shown by mass spectrometry. These results considerably strengthen previous tentative proposals for the pathways for the biosynthesis of dTDP-D-desosamine and dTDP-L-mycarose in Sac. erythraea and reveal that at least some of these enzymes can accommodate alternative substrates.	1
Title: Anti-hepatitis B virus activity and metabolism of 2',3'-dideoxy-2',3'-didehydro-beta-L(-)-5-fluorocytidine Abstract: 2',3'-Dideoxy-2',3'-didehydro-beta-L(-)-5-fluorocytidine [L(-)Fd4C] was found to be at least 10 times more potent than beta-L-2',3'-dideoxy-3'-thiacytidine [L(-)SddC; also called 3TC, or lamivudine]against hepatitis B virus (HBV) in culture. Its cytotoxicity against HepG2 growth in culture was also greater than that of L(-)SddC (3TC). There was no activity of this compound against mitochondrial DNA synthesis in cells at concentrations upto 10 microM. The dynamics of recovery of virus from the medium of cells pretreated with equal drug concentrations were slower with L(-)Fd4C than with L(-)SddC (3TC). L(-)Fd4C could be metabolized to mono-, di-, and triphosphate forms. The degree of L(-)Fd4C phosphorylation to the 5'-triphosphate metabolite was higher than the degree of L(-)SddC (3TC) phosphorylation when equal extracellular concentrations of the two drugs were used. The apparent K(m) of L(-)Fd4C phosphorylated metabolites formed intracellularly was higher than that for L(-)SddC (3TC). This may be due in part to a difference in the behavior of L(-)Fd4C and L(-)SddC (3TC) towards cytosolic deoxycytidine kinase. Furthermore, L(-)Fd4C 5'-triphosphate was retained longer within cells than L(-)SddC (3TC) 5-triphosphate. L(-)Fd4C 5'-triphosphate inhibited HBV DNA polymerase in competition with dCTP with a Ki of 0.069 +/- 0.015 microM. Given the antiviral potency and unique pharmacodynamic properties of L(-)Fd4C, this compound should be considered for development as an expanded-spectrum anti-HBV drug.	0
Title: Similarity and differences in the Lactobacillus acidophilus group identified by polyphasic analysis and comparative genomics Abstract: A set of lactobacilli were investigated by polyphasic analysis. Multilocus sequence analysis, DNA typing, microarray analysis, and in silico whole-genome alignments provided a remarkably consistent pattern of similarity within the Lactobacillus acidophilus complex. On microarray analysis, 17 and 5% of the genes from Lactobacillus johnsonii strain NCC533 represented variable and strain-specific genes, respectively, when tested against four independent isolates of L. johnsonii. When projected on the NCC533 genome map, about 10 large clusters of variable genes were identified, and they were enriched around the terminus of replication. A quarter of the variable genes and two-thirds of the strain-specific genes were associated with mobile DNA. Signatures for horizontal gene transfer and modular evolution were found in prophages and in DNA from the exopolysaccharide biosynthesis cluster. On microarray hybridizations, Lactobacillus gasseri strains showed a shift to significantly lower fluorescence intensities than the L. johnsonii test strains, and only genes encoding very conserved cellular functions from L. acidophilus hybridized to the L. johnsonii array. In-silico comparative genomics showed extensive protein sequence similarity and genome synteny of L. johnsonii with L. gasseri, L. acidophilus, and Lactobacillus delbrueckii; moderate synteny with Lactobacillus casei; and scattered X-type sharing of protein sequence identity with the other sequenced lactobacilli. The observation of a stepwise decrease in similarity between the members of the L. acidophilus group suggests a strong element of vertical evolution in a natural phylogenetic group. Modern whole-genome-based techniques are thus a useful adjunct to the clarification of taxonomical relationships in problematic bacterial groups.	1
Title: New natural products identified by combined genomics-metabolomics profiling of marine Streptomyces sp. MP131-18 Abstract: Marine actinobacteria are drawing more and more attention as a promising source of new natural products. Here we report isolation, genome sequencing and metabolic profiling of new strain Streptomyces sp. MP131-18 isolated from marine sediment sample collected in the Trondheim Fjord, Norway. The 16S rRNA and multilocus phylogenetic analysis showed that MP131-18 belongs to the genus Streptomyces. The genome of MP131-18 isolate was sequenced, and 36 gene clusters involved in the biosynthesis of 18 different types of secondary metabolites were predicted using antiSMASH analysis. The combined genomics-metabolics profiling of the strain led to the identification of several new biologically active compounds. As a result, the family of bisindole pyrroles spiroindimicins was extended with two new members, spiroindimicins E and F. Furthermore, prediction of the biosynthetic pathway for unusual α-pyrone lagunapyrone isolated from MP131-18 resulted in foresight and identification of two new compounds of this family - lagunapyrones D and E. The diversity of identified and predicted compounds from Streptomyces sp. MP131-18 demonstrates that marine-derived actinomycetes are not only a promising source of new natural products, but also represent a valuable pool of genes for combinatorial biosynthesis of secondary metabolites.	1
Title: Nucleotide sequence analysis of a gene cloned from Leptospira biflexa serovar patoc which complements an argE defect in Escherichia coli Abstract: The genus Leptospira, as a member of the order Spirochaetales, forms one of the most ancient evolutionary branches of the eubacteria. These spirochetes are morphologically and physiologically different from most eubacteria, and little is known about Leptospira genetics. In this communication, we report the first nucleotide sequence of a Leptospira gene. A gene which complements an argE mutation in Escherichia coli was isolated from a plasmid-based genomic library composed of Leptospira biflexa serovar patoc DNA. The functional region for the complementing activity was localized by transposon mutagenesis and restriction enzyme mapping and by subcloning. Nucleotide sequence analysis indicated a single open reading frame within the region containing argE complementing activity. The size of the predicted protein, 31,071 daltons, was in excellent agreement with data obtained from coupled transcription-translation reactions primed with cloned L. biflexa DNA. One surprising result was that the predicted amino acid sequence of this protein closely resembles portions of the beta' subunits of RNA polymerases from bacteria and chloroplasts.	0
Title: Structural Insights into Anthranilate Priming during Type II Polyketide Biosynthesis Abstract: The incorporation of nonacetate starter units during type II polyketide biosynthesis helps diversify natural products. Currently, there are few enzymatic strategies for the incorporation of nonacetate starter units in type II polyketide synthase (PKS) pathways. Here we report the crystal structure of AuaEII, the anthranilate:CoA ligase responsible for the generation of anthraniloyl-CoA, which is used as a starter unit by a type II PKS in aurachin biosynthesis. We present structural and protein sequence comparisons to other aryl:CoA ligases. We also compare the AuaEII crystal structure to a model of a CoA ligase homologue, AuaE, which is present in the same gene cluster. AuaE is predicted to have the same fold as AuaEII, but instead of CoA ligation, AuaE catalyzes acyl transfer of anthranilate from anthraniloyl-CoA to the acyl carrier protein (ACP). Together, this work provides insight into the molecular basis for starter unit selection of anthranilate in type II PKS biosynthesis.	1
Title: Catalytic Enantioselective Carbon-Oxygen Bond Formation: Phosphine-Catalyzed Synthesis of Benzylic Ethers via the Oxidation of Benzylic C-H Bonds Abstract: Benzylic alcohols and ethers are common subunits in bioactive molecules, as well as useful intermediates in organic chemistry. In this Communication, we describe a new approach to the enantioselective synthesis of benzylic ethers through the chiral phosphine-catalyzed coupling of two readily available partners, γ-aryl-substituted alkynoates and alcohols, under mild conditions. In this process, the alkynoate partner undergoes an internal redox reaction. Specifically, the benzylic position is oxidized with good enantioselectivity, and the alkyne is reduced to the alkene.	0
Title: Efficient Chemoenzymatic Synthesis of N-Glycans with a β1,4-Galactosylated Bisecting GlcNAc Motif Abstract: In human serum immunoglobulin G (IgG), a rare modification of biantennary complex N-glycans lead to a β1,4-galactosylated bisecting GlcNAc branch. We found that the bisecting GlcNAc on a biantennary core-fucosylated N-glycan was enzymatically galactosylated under stringent reaction conditions. Further optimizations led to an efficient enzymatic approach to this particular modification for biantennary substrates. Notably, tri- and tetra-antennary complex N-glycans were not converted by bovine galactosyltransferase. An N-glycan with a galactosylated bisecting GlcNAc was linked to a lanthanide binding tag. The pseudo-contact shifts (PCS) obtained from the corresponding Dy-complex were used to calculate the conformational preferences of the rare N-glycan. Besides two extended conformations only a single folded conformation was found.	0
Title: Thioesterase-mediated side chain transesterification generates potent Gq signaling inhibitor FR900359 Abstract: The potent and selective Gq protein inhibitor depsipeptide FR900359 (FR), originally discovered as the product of an uncultivable plant endosymbiont, is synthesized by a complex biosynthetic system comprising two nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) assembly lines. Here we characterize a cultivable bacterial FR producer, enabling detailed investigations into biosynthesis and attachment of the functionally important FR side chain. We reconstitute side chain assembly by the monomodular NRPS FrsA and the non-heme monooxygenase FrsH, and characterize intermolecular side chain transesterification to the final macrocyclic intermediate FR-Core, mediated by the FrsA thioesterase domain. We harness FrsA substrate promiscuity to generate FR analogs with altered side chains and demonstrate indispensability of the FR side chain for efficient Gq inhibition by comparative bioactivity, toxicity and docking studies. Finally, evolution of FR and side chain biosynthesis is discussed based on bioinformatics analyses. Side chain transesterification boosts potency and target affinity of selective Gq inhibitor natural products.	1
Title: Characterization of Miharamycin Biosynthesis Reveals a Hybrid NRPS-PKS to Synthesize High-Carbon Sugar from a Complex Nucleoside Abstract: Miharamycins are peptidyl nucleoside antibiotics with a unique branched C9 pyranosyl amino acid core and a rare 2-aminopurine moiety. Inactivation of 19 genes in the biosynthetic gene cluster and identification of several unexpected intermediates suggest an alternative biosynthetic pathway, which is further supported by feeding experiments and in vitro characterization of an unusual adenylation domain recognizing a complex nucleoside derivative as the substrate. These results thereby provide an unprecedented biosynthetic route of high-carbon sugar catalyzed by atypical hybrid nonribosomal peptide synthetase-polyketide synthase.	1
Title: Effects of Temperature on Methanogenesis in a Thermophilic (58 degrees C) Anaerobic Digestor Abstract: The short-term effects of temperature on methanogenesis from acetate or CO(2) in a thermophilic (58 degrees C) anaerobic digestor were studied by incubating digestor sludge at different temperatures with C-labeled methane precursors (CH(3)COO or CO(2)). During a period when Methanosarcina sp. was numerous in the sludge, methanogenesis from acetate was optimal at 55 to 60 degrees C and was completely inhibited at 65 degrees C. A Methanosarcina culture isolated from the digestor grew optimally on acetate at 55 to 58 degrees C and did not grow or produce methane at 65 degrees C. An accidental shift of digestor temperature from 58 to 64 degrees C during this period caused a sharp decrease in gas production and a large increase in acetate concentration within 24 h, indicating that the aceticlastic methanogens in the digestor were the population most susceptible to this temperature increase. During a later period when Methanothrix sp. was numerous in the digestor, methanogenesis from CH(3)COO was optimal at 65 degrees C and completely inhibited at 75 degrees C. A partially purified Methanothrix enrichment culture derived from the digestor had a maximum growth temperature near 70 degrees C. Methanogenesis from CO(2) in the sludge was optimal at 65 degrees C and still proceeded at 75 degrees C. A CO(2)-reducing Methanobacterium sp. isolated from the digestor was capable of methanogenesis at 75 degrees C. During the period when Methanothix sp. was apparently dominant, sludge incubated for 24 h at 65 degrees C produced more methane than sludge incubated at 60 degrees C, and no acetate accumulated at 65 degrees C. Methanogenesis was severely inhibited in sludge incubated at 70 degrees C, but since neither acetate nor H(2) accumulated, production of these methanogenic substrates by fermentative bacteria was probably the most temperature-sensitive process. Thus, there was a correlation between digestor performance at different temperatures and responses to temperature by cultures of methanogens believed to play important roles in the digestor.	0
Title: Identification and characterization of mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase as a promising antiviral therapeutic target Abstract: The causative agent of COVID-19 is a novel betacoronavirus or severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), which has emerged as a pandemic of global concern. Considering its rapid transmission, WHO has declared public health emergency on 11th March 2020 worldwide. SARS-CoV-2 is a genetically diverse positive sense RNA virus that typically exhibit high rates of mutation than DNA viruses. Higher rates of mutation bring higher genomic variability which may lead to viral evolution and enabling viruses to evade the pre-existing immunity of host and quickly acquire drug resistance properties. The objective of our study was to compare the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp sequences of Indian SARS-CoV-2 isolates with those of Wuhan type virus. A total of 384 point mutations were detected from 488 sequence of the RdRp protein of Indian SARS-CoV-2 genome, out of which seven were used for subsequent study. Furthermore, prediction of secondary structure, protein modeling and its dynamics were performed which revealed that seven mutations (R118C, T148I, Y149C, E802A, Q822H, V880I and D893Y) significantly altered the stability and flexibility of RdRp protein. Present study was therefore, undertaken to analyze the variations occurring in RdRp due to multiple mutations leading to the alterations in the structure and function of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase which is essential for the replication /transcription of this virus and hence can be utilized as a promising therapeutic target to curb SARS-CoV-2 infections.	0
Title: Cloning, sequencing and characterization of the biosynthetic gene cluster of sanglifehrin A, a potent cyclophilin inhibitor Abstract: Sanglifehrin A (SFA), a potent cyclophilin inhibitor produced by Streptomyces flaveolus DSM 9954, bears a unique [5.5] spirolactam moiety conjugated with a 22-membered, highly functionalized macrolide through a linear carbon chain. SFA displays a diverse range of biological activities and offers significant therapeutic potential. However, the structural complexity of SFA poses a tremendous challenge for new analogue development via chemical synthesis. Based on a rational prediction of its biosynthetic origin, herein we report the cloning, sequencing and characterization of the gene cluster responsible for SFA biosynthesis. Analysis of the 92 776 bp contiguous DNA region reveals a mixed polyketide synthase (PKS)/non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) pathway which includes a variety of unique features for unusual PKS and NRPS building block formation. Our findings suggest that SFA biosynthesis requires a crotonyl-CoA reductase/carboxylase (CCR) for generation of the putative unusual PKS starter unit (2R)-2-ethylmalonamyl-CoA, an iterative type I PKS for the putative atypical extender unit (2S)-2-(2-oxo-butyl)malonyl-CoA and a phenylalanine hydroxylase for the NRPS extender unit (2S)-m-tyrosine. A spontaneous ketalization of significant note, may trigger spirolactam formation in a stereo-selective manner. This study provides a framework for the application of combinatorial biosynthesis methods in order to expand the structural diversity of SFA.	1
Title: Proteus mirabilis fimbriae (PMF) are important for both bladder and kidney colonization in mice Abstract: Proteus mirabilis expresses different types of fimbriae simultaneously. Several fimbrial types have been described and their role in the colonization of the urinary tract is under study. Previously, P. mirabilis fimbriae (PMF) have been shown to be associated with bacterial colonization of the lower urinary tract but not of the kidneys. In this study, a pmfA mutant was generated and used in several in vivo and in vitro studies. Two different urinary tract infection models in the mouse and two in vitro assays of bacterial adhesion to uroepithelial cells were performed. Expression of PmfA in a collection of P. mirabilis strains of different sources was also assessed. The results shown here indicate that PMF are involved in both bladder and kidney colonization by P. mirabilis and that these fimbriae are widely distributed among P. mirabilis isolates from different origins since all strains tested expressed PmfA.	0

Title: Unlocking Cryptic Metabolites with Mass Spectrometry-Guided Transposon Mutant Selection Abstract: The products of most secondary metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) have yet to be discovered, in part due to low expression levels in laboratory cultures. Reporter-guided mutant selection (RGMS) has recently been developed for this purpose: a mutant library is generated and screened, using genetic reporters to a chosen BGC, to select transcriptionally active mutants that then enable the characterization of the "cryptic" metabolite. The requirement for genetic reporters limits the approach to a single pathway within genetically tractable microorganisms. Herein, we utilize untargeted metabolomics in conjunction with transposon mutagenesis to provide a global read-out of secondary metabolism across large numbers of mutants. We employ self-organizing map analytics and imaging mass spectrometry to identify and characterize seven cryptic metabolites from mutant libraries of two different Burkholderia species. Applications of the methodologies reported can expand our understanding of the products and regulation of cryptic BGCs across phylogenetically diverse bacteria.	0
Title: IspG-catalyzed positional isotopic exchange in methylerythritol cyclodiphosphate of the deoxyxylulose phosphate pathway: mechanistic implications Abstract: H(2)(18)O under the bridge: Recently, the deoxyxylulose phosphate (DXP) pathway was discovered to be a second pathway supplying isoprenoid biosynthetic precursors. One of steps is an IspG-catalyzed reductive deoxygenation of methylerythritol cyclodiphosphate (MEcPP) to 4-hydroxyl-3-methyl-2-(E)-1-diphosphate (HMBPP). Using [2-(13) C,(18) O]-MEcPP, we detected the positional isotopic exchange for the bridging oxygen in MEcPP.	0
Title: Bacterial survival in evaporating deposited droplets on a teflon-coated surface Abstract: Understanding of bacterial survival in aerosols is crucial for controlling infection transmission via airborne aerosols and/or large droplets routes. The cell viability changes of four bacteria species (Escherichia coli K12 JM109; Acinetobacter sp. 5A5; Pseudomonas oleovorans X5; and Staphylococcus aureus X8), three Gram-negative and one Gram-positive, in a large evaporating droplet of size 1,800 microm in diameter on teflon-coated slides were measured using the LIVE/DEAD BacLight solution and a microscope. Droplets of three levels of salinity (0, 0.9, and 36% w/v) were tested. All four species survived well during the droplet evaporation process, but died mostly at the time when droplets were dried out at 40-45 min. The final bacteria survival rate after droplets were completely dried was dependent on bacteria species and the salinity of the suspension solution. Droplet evaporation over the first 35-40 min had no adverse effect on bacterial survival for the droplets tested. The lethal effect of desiccation was found to be the most important death mechanism.	0
Title: The psymberin story--biological properties and approaches towards total and analogue syntheses Abstract: Psymberin is a marine natural product which has attracted a great deal of interest since its isolation: While the highly cytotoxic compound was detected early on as an ingredient in a marine sponge, it took over a decade and 600 additional samples for the structure to eventually be assigned. In the last eight years fascinating synthetic and biosynthetic investigations have led to a more detailed understanding as well as a new starting point for structure-activity studies towards new antitumor compounds. The Review gives an in-depth insight into the progress in the field of the marine polyketide psymberin and demonstrates how organic synthesis is influencing neighboring scientific subjects.	1
