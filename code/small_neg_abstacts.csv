We report an unusual case of an amyloidoma of the gasserian ganglion associated with trigeminal neuralgia. MR imaging showed a mass in Meckel's cave, which was isointense with surrounding tissue on T1-weighted images and hypointense on T2-weighted images. After contrast administration, the mass enhanced homogeneously, and thin cuts through the region showed involvement in the expected location of the gasserian ganglion and, more laterally and inferiorly, in the proximal part of V1. A review of the literature revealed that only one similar case has been reported since the advent of modern neuroimaging. Amyloidoma, although rare, may be considered as a rare differential diagnosis of a mass in this region.	0
Since 1970, WHO has conducted a collaborative study on the use of "excess mortality" from respiratory diseases (that is, the number of deaths actually recorded in excess of the number expected on the basis of past seasonal experience) in order to assess in 13 different countries the severity of influenza epidemics. The use of computer-produced seasonal expected and actual curves permits quick visual assessment of influenza activity in any one country, as well as comparisons between different countries. The study demonstrates that an excess in the observed over the expected number of total deaths does not necessarily indicate an excess in deaths from influenza, and it is therefore limited, at least for the present time, to deaths from respiratory disease. It provides a week-to-week record of deaths from acute respiratory disease in countries where weekly returns are available and a retrospective analysis of the disease pattern in the collaborating countries. This study will be continued for a number of years and, apart from its value to the individual countries, should provide useful comparisons between countries with different climates.	0
Polypeptide-tag/small-molecule pairs for specific cellular protein labeling are useful for visualizing cellular proteins and controlling their activity. Here, we report the development of an in vitro evolution-based (poly)peptide tag identification system named the DIVERSE (Directed In Vitro Evolution of Reactive peptide tags via Sequential Enrichment) system. In this system, an extremely diverse (10(14)) library of peptide tags, displayed by covalent attachment to their encoding cDNAs, is continuously prepared from the DNA library in a one-pot approach. Using this system, we demonstrated de novo creation of non-enzymatically covalent-labeling peptide tags for a synthetic small-molecule target from a random peptide library. Protein labeling with these tags was applicable to N- and C-terminal fusions, multiple different proteins and fluorophores, and intracellular labeling. The DIVERSE system can be used not only for the de novo creation of polypeptide tags but also sequence optimization of existing polypeptide tags from extremely diverse libraries.	0
PKG is a multifaceted signaling molecule and potential pharmaceutical target due to its role in smooth muscle function. A helix identified in the structure of the regulatory domain of PKG Iα suggests a novel architecture of the holoenzyme. In this study, a set of synthetic peptides (S-tides), derived from this helix, was found to bind to and activate PKG Iα in a cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)-independent manner. The most potent S-tide derivative (S1.5) increased the open probability of the potassium channel KCa1.1 to levels equivalent to saturating cGMP. Introduction of S1.5 to smooth muscle cells in isolated, endothelium-denuded cerebral arteries through a modified reversible permeabilization procedure inhibited myogenic constriction. In contrast, in endothelium-intact vessels S1.5 had no effect on myogenic tone. This suggests that PKG Iα activation by S1.5 in vascular smooth muscle would be sufficient to inhibit augmented arterial contractility that frequently occurs following endothelial damage associated with cardiovascular disease.	0
Gram-negative bacteria utilize heptoses as part of their repertoire of extracellular polysaccharide virulence determinants. Disruption of heptose biosynthesis offers an attractive target for novel antimicrobials. A critical step in the synthesis of heptoses is their 1-O phosphorylation, mediated by kinases such as HldE or WcbL. Here, we present the structure of WcbL from Burkholderia pseudomallei. We report that WcbL operates through a sequential ordered Bi-Bi mechanism, loading the heptose first and then ATP. We show that dimeric WcbL binds ATP anti-cooperatively in the absence of heptose, and cooperatively in its presence. Modeling of WcbL suggests that heptose binding causes an elegant switch in the hydrogen-bonding network, facilitating the binding of a second ATP molecule. Finally, we screened a library of drug-like fragments, identifying hits that potently inhibit WcbL. Our results provide a novel mechanism for control of substrate binding and emphasize WcbL as an attractive anti-microbial target for Gram-negative bacteria.	0
Each month, Chemistry & Biology Select highlights a selection of research reports from the recent literature. These highlights are a snapshot of interesting research done across the field of chemical biology. Our December 2015 selection includes an insight into how vitamin C destroys cancer cells, a new method that makes possible the investigatation of sulfhydration, and the mapping of the CFTR interactome and how it depends on the environmental conditions and differs between wild-type and disease-causing mutant.	0
Halophilic organisms thrive in environments with extreme salt concentrations and have adapted by allowing molar quantities of cosolutes, mainly KCl, to accumulate in their cytoplasm. To cope with this high intracellular salinity, halophilic organisms modified the chemical composition of their proteins to enrich their surface with acidic and short polar side chains, while lysines and bulky hydrophobic residues got depleted. We have emulated the evolutionary process of haloadaptation with natural and designed halophilic polypeptides and applied novel nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) methodology to study the different mechanisms contributing to protein haloadaptation at a per residue level. Our analysis of an extensive set of NMR observables, determined over several proteins, allowed us to disentangle the synergistic contributions of protein haloadaptation: cation exclusion and electrostatic repulsion between negatively charged residues destabilize the denatured state ensemble while cumulative weak cation-protein interactions stabilize the folded conformations.	0
The phospholipase-catalyzed release of free fatty acids (FFAs) from phospholipids is implicated in many critical biological processes such as neurotransmission, inflammation, and cancer. However, determining the individual change in FFAs generated during these processes has remained challenging due to the limitations of current methods, and has hampered our understanding of these key mediators. Here, we developed an "iTRAQ"-like method for profiling FFAs by stable isotope tagging (FFAST), based on the differential labeling of the carboxyl group and designed to resolve analytical variance, through a multiplexed assay in cells and subcellular fractions. With nanomolar sensitivity, this method revealed a spectrum of saturated FFAs elicited during stimulation of exocytosis that was identical in neurons and neurosecretory cells. Purified secretory vesicles also generated these FFAs when challenged with cytosol. Our multiplex method will be invaluable to assess the range of FFAs generated in other physiological and pathological settings.	0
Current approaches for optogenetic control of transcription do not mimic the activity of endogenous transcription factors, which act at numerous sites in the genome in a complex interplay with other factors. Optogenetic control of dominant negative versions of endogenous transcription factors provides a mechanism for mimicking the natural regulation of gene expression. Here we describe opto-DN-CREB, a blue-light-controlled inhibitor of the transcription factor CREB created by fusing the dominant negative inhibitor A-CREB to photoactive yellow protein (PYP). A light-driven conformational change in PYP prevents coiled-coil formation between A-CREB and CREB, thereby activating CREB. Optogenetic control of CREB function was characterized in vitro, in HEK293T cells, and in neurons where blue light enabled control of expression of the CREB targets NR4A2 and c-Fos. Dominant negative inhibitors exist for numerous transcription factors; linking these to optogenetic domains offers a general approach for spatiotemporal control of native transcriptional events.	0
Vitamin D3 is made in the skin from 7-dehydrocholesterol under the influence of UV light. Vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol) is derived from the plant sterol ergosterol. Vitamin D is metabolized first to 25 hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD), then to the hormonal form 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH)2D). CYP2R1 is the most important 25-hydroxylase; CYP27B1 is the key 1-hydroxylase. Both 25OHD and 1,25(OH)2D are catabolized by CYP24A1. 1,25(OH)2D is the ligand for the vitamin D receptor (VDR), a transcription factor, binding to sites in the DNA called vitamin D response elements (VDREs). There are thousands of these binding sites regulating hundreds of genes in a cell-specific fashion. VDR-regulated transcription is dependent on comodulators, the profile of which is also cell specific. Analogs of 1,25(OH)2D are being developed to target specific diseases with minimal side effects. This review will examine these different aspects of vitamin D metabolism, mechanism of action, and clinical application.	0
BRD4, a bromodomain and extraterminal domain (BET) family member, is an attractive target in multiple pathological settings, particularly cancer. While BRD4 inhibitors have shown some promise in MYC-driven malignancies such as Burkitt's lymphoma (BL), we show that BRD4 inhibitors lead to robust BRD4 protein accumulation, which may account for their limited suppression of MYC expression, modest antiproliferative activity, and lack of apoptotic induction. To address these limitations we designed ARV-825, a hetero-bifunctional PROTAC (Proteolysis Targeting Chimera) that recruits BRD4 to the E3 ubiquitin ligase cereblon, leading to fast, efficient, and prolonged degradation of BRD4 in all BL cell lines tested. Consequently, ARV-825 more effectively suppresses c-MYC levels and downstream signaling than small-molecule BRD4 inhibitors, resulting in more effective cell proliferation inhibition and apoptosis induction in BL. Our findings provide strong evidence that cereblon-based PROTACs provide a better and more efficient strategy in targeting BRD4 than traditional small-molecule inhibitors.	0
Ark1, the unique Aurora kinase in Schizosaccharomyces pombe, regulates multiple aspects of mitosis. In this issue of Chemistry & Biology, Kawashima and colleagues report the discovery and validation of a fungal Ark1 inhibitor, which they employ to evaluate the mitotic outputs of endogenous Ark1 signaling.	0
Accumulating evidence has linked G-quadruplex structures to a number of biological processes in vivo, including DNA replication, transcription, and genomic maintenance. However, the precise function and mechanism of G-quadruplex formation in mammalian cells remains poorly defined. Therefore, the development of small-molecule G-quadruplex probes has attracted significant attention in recent years. This review highlights examples of G-quadruplex probes that have been reported over the last few years, some of which have been employed for cellular imaging or for use in the construction of G-quadruplex-based analytical sensing platforms.	0
Glycomics is a broad and emerging scientific discipline focused on defining the structures and functional roles of glycans in biological systems. The staggering complexity of the glycome, minimally defined as the repertoire of glycans expressed in a cell or organism, has resulted in many challenges that must be overcome; these are being addressed by new advances in mass spectrometry as well as by the expansion of genetic and cell biology studies. Conversely, identifying the specific glycan recognition determinants of glycan-binding proteins by employing the new technology of glycan microarrays is providing insights into how glycans function in recognition and signaling within an organism and with microbes and pathogens. The promises of a more complete knowledge of glycomes are immense in that glycan modifications of intracellular and extracellular proteins have critical functions in almost all biological pathways.	0
In this issue, Young, Moody, and colleagues report the discovery of an isomer of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) virulence factor 1-tuberculosinyl adenosine, N(6)-tuberculosinyl adenosine, in mice infected with tuberculosis. These Mtb-derived terpene compounds may serve as sensitive and specific biomarkers of infection.	0
Gaucher's disease is a hereditary deficiency of the enzyme β-glucocerebrosidase (GCase) that is most commonly treated by enzyme replacement therapy. In this issue of Chemistry & Biology, Tan and colleagues search for alternative ways to rehabilitate mutant GCase by understanding how it interacts with the proteostasis network.	0
AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) functions as a signaling hub to balance energy supply with demand. Phosphorylation of activation loop Thr172 has been considered as an essential step in AMPK activation. In this issue of Chemistry & Biology, Scott and colleagues show that the small molecule direct AMPK activator, A-769662, bypasses this phosphorylation event and acts synergistically with AMP on naive AMPK.	0
Reactivity probes are small molecules that contain a reactive electrophile and a purification handle, and are used to identify hyperreactive amino acid residues within a whole proteome. In this issue of Chemistry & Biology, Gu et al. use sulfonyl fluoride derivatives for the identification of functional tyrosine residues in different classes of glutathione S-transferases.	0
Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-interacting kinases (Mnks) regulate the initiation of translation through phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E). Mnk-mediated eIF4E activation promotes cancer development and progression. While the phosphorylation of eIF4E is necessary for oncogenic transformation, the kinase activity of Mnks seems dispensable for normal development. For this reason, pharmacological inhibition of Mnks could represent an ideal mechanism-based and nontoxic therapeutic strategy for cancer treatment. In this review, we discuss the current understanding of Mnk biological roles, structures, and functions, as well as clinical implications. Importantly, we propose different strategies for identification of highly selective small molecule inhibitors of Mnks, including exploring a structural feature of their kinase domain, DFD motif, which is unique within the human kinome. We also argue that a combined targeting of Mnks and other pathways should be considered given the complexity of cancer.	0
The protozoan Cryptosporidium is notorious for its resistance to chlorine disinfection, a mainstay of water treatment. Human infections, mainly of the small intestine, arise from consumption of faecally contaminated food or water, environmental exposure, and person-to-person or animal-to-person spread. Acute gastrointestinal symptoms can be prolonged but are usually self-limiting. Problems arise with immune-deficient, including malnourished, people including chronic diarrhoea, hepato-biliary tree and extra-gastrointestinal site infection, and few options for treatment or prevention exist. Although genomics has enabled refined classification, identification of chemotherapeutic targets and vaccine candidates, and putative factors for host adaption and pathogenesis, their confirmation has been hampered by a lack of biological tools.	0
Mycoplasma genitalium is a fastidious organism of the class Mollicutes, the smallest prokaryote capable of independent replication. First isolated in 1981, much is still unknown regarding its natural history in untreated infection. It is recognized as a sexually transmitted pathogen causing acute and chronic non-gonococcal urethritis (NGU) in men, with a growing body of evidence to suggest it also causes cervicitis and pelvic inflammatory disease in women. Its role in several other clinical syndromes is uncertain. The majority of people infected remain asymptomatic and clear infection without developing disease; asymptomatic screening is therefore not recommended. Prevalence rates are higher in patients attending sexual health clinics and in men with NGU. Limited availability of diagnostics has encouraged syndromic management, resulting in widespread antimicrobial resistance and given that few antimicrobial classes have activity against M. genitalium, there is significant concern regarding the emergence of untreatable strains. There is a need for wider availability of testing, which should include detection of macrolide resistance mediating mutations. Expertise in interpretation of microbiological results with clinical correlation ensures targeted treatment avoiding unnecessary antibiotic exposure. Public health surveillance nationally and internationally is vital in monitoring and responding to changing epidemiology trends. In this review, we summarize current knowledge of M. genitalium, including epidemiology, clinical and microbiological data, and discuss treatment challenges in the era of rising multidrug resistance.	0
Cryptococcus neoformans is a lethal fungus disguised in a polysaccharide coat. It can remain dormant in the host for decades prior to reactivation, causing systemic cryptococcosis in humans and other mammals. Cryptococcus deploys a multitude of traits to adapt to and survive within the host, including immunosuppression, an ability to replicate intra- and extra-cellularly in phagocytes, changes in morphology and ploidy, a predilection to infect the CNS, and the capacity to utilize neurotransmitters and unique carbon sources available in the brain. These pathogenic strategies displayed by this fungus might have evolved through its interactions with microbial predators in the environment.	0
The Type VI secretion system (T6SS) is a protein nanomachine that is widespread in Gram-negative bacteria and is used to translocate effector proteins directly into neighbouring cells. It represents a versatile bacterial weapon that can deliver effectors into distinct classes of target cells, playing key roles in inter-bacterial competition and bacterial interactions with eukaryotic cells. This versatility is underpinned by the ability of the T6SS to deliver a vast array of effector proteins, with many distinct activities and modes of interaction with the secretion machinery. Recent work has highlighted the importance and diversity of interactions mediated by T6SSs within polymicrobial communities, and offers new molecular insights into effector delivery and action in target cells.	0
Algal blooms have severe impacts on the utilization of water resources. The discovery of allelopathy provides a new dimension to solving this problem due to its high efficiency, safety and economy. Allelopathy can suppress the growth of microalgae by impairing the structure, photosynthesis and enzyme activity of algal cells. In the current work, we first demonstrate the allelopathy and allelochemicals derived from both plants and algae. We then expound the potential mechanisms of allelopathy on microalgae. Next, the potential application of allelochemicals in water environment is proposed. Finally, the key challenge and future perspective are presented.	0
The strength, flexibility and light weight of traditional oil-derived plastics make them ideal materials for a large number of applications, including packaging, medical devices, building, transportation, etc. However, the majority of produced plastics are single-use plastics, which, coupled with a throw-away culture, leads to the accumulation of plastic waste and pollution, as well as the loss of a valuable resource. In this review we discuss the advances and possibilities in the biotransformation and biodegradation of oil-based plastics. We review bio-based and biodegradable polymers and highlight the importance of end-of-life management of biodegradables. Finally, we discuss the role of a circular economy in reducing plastic waste pollution.	0
Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a Gram-negative opportunistic pathogen and a model bacterium for studying virulence and bacterial social traits. While it can be isolated in low numbers from a wide variety of environments including soil and water, it can readily be found in almost any human/animal-impacted environment. It is a major cause of illness and death in humans with immunosuppressive and chronic conditions, and infections in these patients are difficult to treat due to a number of antibiotic resistance mechanisms and the organism's propensity to form multicellular biofilms.	0
Pore-forming toxins (PFTs) are widely distributed in both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. PFTs can act as virulence factors that bacteria utilise in dissemination and host colonisation or, alternatively, they can be employed to compete with rival microbes in polymicrobial niches. PFTs transition from a soluble form to become membrane-embedded by undergoing large conformational changes. Once inserted, they perforate the membrane, causing uncontrolled efflux of ions and/or nutrients and dissipating the protonmotive force (PMF). In some instances, target cells intoxicated by PFTs display additional effects as part of the cellular response to pore formation. Significant progress has been made in the mechanistic description of pore formation for the different PFTs families, but in several cases a complete understanding of pore structure remains lacking. PFTs have evolved recognition mechanisms to bind specific receptors that define their host tropism, although this can be remarkably diverse even within the same family. Here we summarise the salient features of PFTs and highlight where additional research is necessary to fully understand the mechanism of pore formation by members of this diverse group of protein toxins.	0
The discovery of penicillin by Alexander Fleming marked a new era for modern medicine, allowing not only the treatment of infectious diseases, but also the safe performance of life-saving interventions, like surgery and chemotherapy. Unfortunately, resistance against penicillin, as well as more complex β-lactam antibiotics, has rapidly emerged since the introduction of these drugs in the clinic, and is largely driven by a single type of extra-cytoplasmic proteins, hydrolytic enzymes called β-lactamases. While the structures, biochemistry and epidemiology of these resistance determinants have been extensively characterized, their biogenesis, a complex process including multiple steps and involving several fundamental biochemical pathways, is rarely discussed. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the journey of β-lactamases, from the moment they exit the ribosomal channel until they reach their final cellular destination as folded and active enzymes.	0
Nitrosopumilus maritimus is a marine ammonia-oxidizing archaeon with a high affinity for ammonia. It fixes carbon via a modified hydroxypropionate/hydroxybutyrate cycle and shows weak utilization of cyanate as a supplementary energy and nitrogen source. When oxygen is depleted, N. maritimus produces its own oxygen, which may explain its regular occurrence in anoxic waters. Several enzymes of the ammonia oxidation and oxygen production pathways remain to be identified.	0
Here we respond to Zhou (BMC Genomics 21:734, 2020) "Combined Transcriptome and Metabolome analysis of Pitaya fruit unveiled the mechanisms underlying peel and pulp color formation" published in BMC Genomics. Given the evolutionary conserved anthocyanin biosynthesis pathway in betalain-pigmented species, we are open to the idea that species with both anthocyanins and betalains might exist. However, in absence of LC-MS/MS spectra, apparent lack of biological replicates, and no comparison to authentic standards, the findings of Zhou (BMC Genomics 21:734, 2020) are not a strong basis to propose the presence of anthocyanins in betalain-pigmented pitaya. In addition, our re-analysis of the datasets indicates the misidentification of important genes and the omission of key flavonoid and anthocyanin synthesis genes ANS and DFR. Finally, our re-analysis of the RNA-Seq dataset reveals no correlation between anthocyanin biosynthesis gene expression and pigment status.	0
Background:                    Spliceosomal introns are parts of primary transcripts that are removed by RNA splicing. Although introns apparently do not contribute to the function of the mature transcript, in vertebrates they comprise the majority of the transcribed region increasing the metabolic cost of transcription. The persistence of long introns across evolutionary time suggests functional roles that can offset this metabolic cost. The teleosts comprise one of the largest vertebrate clades. They have unusually compact and variable genome sizes and provide a suitable system for analysing intron evolution.              Results:                    We have analysed intron lengths in 172 vertebrate genomes and show that teleost intron lengths are relatively short, highly variable and bimodally distributed. Introns that were long in teleosts were also found to be long in mammals and were more likely to be found in regulatory genes and to contain conserved sequences. Our results argue that intron length has decreased in parallel in a non-random manner throughout teleost evolution and represent a deviation from the ancestral state.              Conclusion:                    Our observations indicate an accelerated rate of intron size evolution in the teleosts and that teleost introns can be divided into two classes by their length. Teleost intron sizes have evolved primarily as a side-effect of genome size evolution and small genomes are dominated by short introns (<256 base pairs). However, a non-random subset of introns has resisted this process across the teleosts and these are more likely have functional roles in all vertebrate clades.	0
Background:                    Shotgun metagenomics yields ever richer and larger data volumes on the complex communities living in diverse environments. Extracting deep insights from the raw reads heavily depends on the availability of fast, accurate and user-friendly biodiversity analysis tools.              Results:                    Because environmental samples may contain strains and species that are not covered in reference databases and because protein sequences are more conserved than the genes encoding them, we explore the alternative route of taxonomic profiling based on protein coding regions translated from the shotgun metagenomics reads, instead of directly processing the DNA reads. We therefore developed the Unipept MetaGenomics Analysis Pipeline (UMGAP), a highly versatile suite of open source tools that are implemented in Rust and support parallelization to achieve optimal performance. Six preconfigured pipelines with different performance trade-offs were carefully selected, and benchmarked against a selection of state-of-the-art shotgun metagenomics taxonomic profiling tools.              Conclusions:                    UMGAP's protein space detour for taxonomic profiling makes it competitive with state-of-the-art shotgun metagenomics tools. Despite our design choices of an extra protein translation step, a broad spectrum index that can identify both archaea, bacteria, eukaryotes and viruses, and a highly configurable non-monolithic design, UMGAP achieves low runtime, manageable memory footprint and high accuracy. Its interactive visualizations allow for easy exploration and comparison of complex communities.	0
Background:                    The COVID-19 pandemic remains a global public health concern. Advances in sequencing technologies has allowed for high numbers of SARS-CoV-2 whole genome sequence (WGS) data and rapid sharing of sequences through global repositories to enable almost real-time genomic analysis of the pathogen. WGS data has been used previously to group genetically similar viral pathogens to reveal evidence of transmission, including methods that identify distinct clusters on a phylogenetic tree. Identifying clusters of linked cases can aid in the regional surveillance and management of the disease. In this study, we present a novel method for producing stable genomic clusters of SARS-CoV-2 cases, cov2clusters, and compare the accuracy and stability of our approach to previous methods used for phylogenetic clustering using real-world SARS-CoV-2 sequence data obtained from British Columbia, Canada.              Results:                    We found that cov2clusters produced more stable clusters than previously used phylogenetic clustering methods when adding sequence data through time, mimicking an increase in sequence data through the pandemic. Our method also showed high accuracy when predicting epidemiologically informed clusters from sequence data.              Conclusions:                    Our new approach allows for the identification of stable clusters of SARS-CoV-2 from WGS data. Producing high-resolution SARS-CoV-2 clusters from sequence data alone can a challenge and, where possible, both genomic and epidemiological data should be used in combination.	0
Background:                    Ribosomally-synthesized cyclic peptides are widely found in plants and exhibit useful bioactivities for humans. The identification of cyclic peptide sequences and their precursor proteins is facilitated by the growing number of sequenced genomes. While previous research largely focused on the chemical diversity of these peptides across various species, there is little attention to a broader range of potential peptides that are not chemically identified.              Results:                    A pioneering study was initiated to explore the genetic diversity of linusorbs, a group of cyclic peptides uniquely occurring in cultivated flax (Linum usitatissimum). Phylogenetic analysis clustered the 5 known linusorb precursor proteins into two clades and one singleton. Preliminary tBLASTn search of the published flax genome using the whole protein sequence as query could only retrieve its homologues within the same clade. This limitation was overcome using a profile-based mining strategy. After genome reannotation, a hidden Markov Model (HMM)-based approach identified 58 repeats homologous to the linusorb-embedded repeats in 8 novel proteins, implying that they share common ancestry with the linusorb-embedded repeats. Subsequently, we developed a customized profile composed of a random linusorb-like domain (LLD) flanked by 5 conserved sites and used it for string search of the proteome, which extracted 281 LLD-containing repeats (LLDRs) in 25 proteins. Comparative analysis of different repeat categories suggested that the 5 conserved flanking sites among the non-homologous repeats have undergone convergent evolution driven by functional selection.              Conclusions:                    The profile-based mining approach is suitable for analyzing repetitive sequences. The 25 LLDR proteins identified herein represent the potential diversity of cyclic peptides within the flax genome and lay a foundation for further studies on the functions and evolution of these protein tandem repeats.	0
Background:                    The collection of circRNAs mostly focused on their sequence composition such as protein/miRNA binding motif, and/or regulatory elements such as internal ribosome entry site. However, less attention was paid to subcellular localization. CircVIS aimed to provide a collection of circRNAs with information of subcellular compartments and also integrated the circRNA entries from previous circRNA databases.              Results:                    A collection of circRNAs from public circRNA databases and de novo identification were annotated according to subcellular localizations including nucleoplasm, chromatin-associated parts, cytoplasm and polyribosome. All circRNAs were aligned to a selected major transcript, and if presence, the circRNA-derived open reading frame with annotation of functional domain were compared to its parental protein. The results showed that distinct circRNAs may exert their molecular and cellular functions in different subcellular compartments. The web service is made freely available at http://lab-x-omics.nchu.edu.tw/circVIS .              Conclusions:                    CircVIS allows users to visualize the alignment between a given circRNA and its most relevant reference transcript along with information of subcellular localization.	0
Background:                    The majority of Genome Wide Associate Study (GWAS) loci fall in the non-coding genome, making causal variants difficult to identify and study. We hypothesized that the regulatory features underlying causal variants are biologically specific, identifiable from data, and that the regulatory architecture that influences one trait is distinct compared to biologically unrelated traits.              Results:                    To better characterize and identify these variants, we used publicly available GWAS loci and genomic annotations to build 17 Trait Specific Annotation Based Locus (TSABL) predictors to identify differences between GWAS loci associated with different phenotypic trait groups. We used a penalized binomial logistic regression model to select trait relevant annotations and tested all models on a holdout set of loci not used for training in any trait. We were able to successfully build models for autoimmune, electrocardiogram, lipid, platelet, red blood cell, and white blood cell trait groups. We used these models both to prioritize variants in existing loci and to identify new genomic regions of interest.              Conclusions:                    We found that TSABL models identified biologically relevant regulatory features, and anticipate their future use to enhance the design and interpretation of genetic studies.	0
Background:                    To detect changes in biological processes, samples are often studied at several time points. We examined expression data measured at different developmental stages, or more broadly, historical data. Hence, the main assumption of our proposed methodology was the independence between the examined samples over time. In addition, however, the examinations were clustered at each time point by measuring littermates from relatively few mother mice at each developmental stage. As each examination was lethal, we had an independent data structure over the entire history, but a dependent data structure at a particular time point. Over the course of these historical data, we wanted to identify abrupt changes in the parameter of interest - change points.              Results:                    In this study, we demonstrated the application of generalized hypothesis testing using a linear mixed effects model as a possible method to detect change points. The coefficients from the linear mixed model were used in multiple contrast tests and the effect estimates were visualized with their respective simultaneous confidence intervals. The latter were used to determine the change point(s). In small simulation studies, we modelled different courses with abrupt changes and compared the influence of different contrast matrices. We found two contrasts, both capable of answering different research questions in change point detection: The Sequen contrast to detect individual change points and the McDermott contrast to find change points due to overall progression. We provide the R code for direct use with provided examples. The applicability of those tests for real experimental data was shown with in-vivo data from a preclinical study.              Conclusion:                    Simultaneous confidence intervals estimated by multiple contrast tests using the model fit from a linear mixed model were capable to determine change points in clustered expression data. The confidence intervals directly delivered interpretable effect estimates representing the strength of the potential change point. Hence, scientists can define biologically relevant threshold of effect strength depending on their research question. We found two rarely used contrasts best fitted for detection of a possible change point: the Sequen and McDermott contrasts.	0
Background:                    Protein-protein interaction (PPI) is very important for many biochemical processes. Therefore, accurate prediction of PPI can help us better understand the role of proteins in biochemical processes. Although there are many methods to predict PPI in biology, they are time-consuming and lack accuracy, so it is necessary to build an efficiently and accurately computational model in the field of PPI prediction.              Results:                    We present a novel sequence-based computational approach called DCSE (Double-Channel-Siamese-Ensemble) to predict potential PPI. In the encoding layer, we treat each amino acid as a word, and map it into an N-dimensional vector. In the feature extraction layer, we extract features from local and global perspectives by Multilayer Convolutional Neural Network (MCN) and Multilayer Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit with Convolutional Neural Networks (MBC). Finally, the output of the feature extraction layer is then fed into the prediction layer to output whether the input protein pair will interact each other. The MCN and MBC are siamese and ensemble based network, which can effectively improve the performance of the model. In order to demonstrate our model's performance, we compare it with four machine learning based and three deep learning based models. The results show that our method outperforms other models in all evaluation criteria. The Accuracy, Precision, [Formula: see text], Recall and MCC of our model are 0.9303, 0.9091, 0.9268, 0.9452, 0.8609. For the other seven models, the highest Accuracy, Precision, [Formula: see text], Recall and MCC are 0.9288, 0.9243, 0.9246, 0.9250, 0.8572. We also test our model in the imbalanced dataset and transfer our model to another species. The results show our model is excellent.              Conclusion:                    Our model achieves the best performance by comparing it with seven other models. NLP-based coding method has a good effect on PPI prediction task. MCN and MBC extract protein sequence features from local and global perspectives and these two feature extraction layers are based on siamese and ensemble network structures. Siamese-based network structure can keep the features consistent and ensemble based network structure can effectively improve the accuracy of the model.	0
Background:                    Transcriptome-wide association studies (TWASs) have shown great promise in interpreting the findings from genome-wide association studies (GWASs) and exploring the disease mechanisms, by integrating GWAS and eQTL mapping studies. Almost all TWAS methods only focus on one gene at a time, with exception of only two published multiple-gene methods nevertheless failing to account for the inter-dependence as well as the network structure among multiple genes, which may lead to power loss in TWAS analysis as complex disease often owe to multiple genes that interact with each other as a biological network. We therefore developed a Network Regression method in a two-stage TWAS framework (NeRiT) to detect whether a given network is associated with the traits of interest. NeRiT adopts the flexible Bayesian Dirichlet process regression to obtain the gene expression prediction weights in the first stage, uses pointwise mutual information to represent the general between-node correlation in the second stage and can effectively take the network structure among different gene nodes into account.              Results:                    Comprehensive and realistic simulations indicated NeRiT had calibrated type I error control for testing both the node effect and edge effect, and yields higher power than the existed methods, especially in testing the edge effect. The results were consistent regardless of the GWAS sample size, the gene expression prediction model in the first step of TWAS, the network structure as well as the correlation pattern among different gene nodes. Real data applications through analyzing systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure from UK Biobank showed that NeRiT can simultaneously identify the trait-related nodes as well as the trait-related edges.              Conclusions:                    NeRiT is a powerful and efficient network regression method in TWAS.	0
The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-associated (Cas) systems are adaptive immune systems of bacteria. A type II CRISPR-Cas9 system from Streptococcus pyogenes has recently been developed into a genome engineering tool for prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Here, we present a single-plasmid system which allows efficient genome editing of Bacillus subtilis The plasmid pJOE8999 is a shuttle vector that has a pUC minimal origin of replication for Escherichia coli, the temperature-sensitive replication origin of plasmid pE194(ts) for B. subtilis, and a kanamycin resistance gene working in both organisms. For genome editing, it carries the cas9 gene under the control of the B. subtilis mannose-inducible promoter PmanP and a single guide RNA (sgRNA)-encoding sequence transcribed via a strong promoter. This sgRNA guides the Cas9 nuclease to its target. The 20-nucleotide spacer sequence at the 5' end of the sgRNA sequence, responsible for target specificity, is located between BsaI sites. Thus, the target specificity is altered by changing the spacer sequences via oligonucleotides fitted between the BsaI sites. Cas9 in complex with the sgRNA induces double-strand breaks (DSBs) at its target site. Repair of the DSBs and the required modification of the genome are achieved by adding homology templates, usually two PCR fragments obtained from both sides of the target sequence. Two adjacent SfiI sites enable the ordered integration of these homology templates into the vector. The function of the CRISPR-Cas9 vector was demonstrated by introducing two large deletions in the B. subtilis chromosome and by repair of the trpC2 mutation of B. subtilis 168.              Importance:                    In prokaryotes, most methods used for scarless genome engineering are based on selection-counterselection systems. The disadvantages are often the lack of a suitable counterselection marker, the toxicity of the compounds needed for counterselection, and the requirement of certain mutations in the target strain. CRISPR-Cas systems were recently developed as important tools for genome editing. The single-plasmid system constructed for the genome editing of B. subtilis overcomes the problems of counterselection methods. It allows deletions and introduction of point mutations. It is easy to handle and very efficient, and it may be adapted for use in other firmicutes.	0
In the United States, 1 in 8 women will be diagnosed with breast cancer in her lifetime. Along with genetics, the environment contributes to disease development, but what these exact environmental factors are remains unknown. We have previously shown that breast tissue is not sterile but contains a diverse population of bacteria. We thus believe that the host's local microbiome could be modulating the risk of breast cancer development. Using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing, we show that bacterial profiles differ between normal adjacent tissue from women with breast cancer and tissue from healthy controls. Women with breast cancer had higher relative abundances of Bacillus, Enterobacteriaceae and Staphylococcus Escherichia coli (a member of the Enterobacteriaceae family) and Staphylococcus epidermidis, isolated from breast cancer patients, were shown to induce DNA double-stranded breaks in HeLa cells using the histone-2AX (H2AX) phosphorylation (γ-H2AX) assay. We also found that microbial profiles are similar between normal adjacent tissue and tissue sampled directly from the tumor. This study raises important questions as to what role the breast microbiome plays in disease development or progression and how we can manipulate this for possible therapeutics or prevention.              Importance:                    This study shows that different bacterial profiles in breast tissue exist between healthy women and those with breast cancer. Higher relative abundances of bacteria that had the ability to cause DNA damage in vitro were detected in breast cancer patients, as was a decrease in some lactic acid bacteria, known for their beneficial health effects, including anticarcinogenic properties. This study raises important questions as to the role of the mammary microbiome in modulating the risk of breast cancer development.	0
Stress-induced abdominal dysfunction is an attractive target for probiotics. To investigate the effects of the probiotic Lactobacillus casei strain Shirota on abdominal dysfunction, a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted with healthy medical students undertaking an authorized nationwide examination for academic advancement. For 8 weeks, until the day before the examination, 23 and 24 subjects consumed an L. casei strain Shirota-fermented milk and a placebo milk daily, respectively. In addition to assessments of abdominal symptoms, psychophysical state, and salivary stress markers, gene expression changes in peripheral blood leukocytes and composition of the gut microbiota were analyzed using DNA microarray analysis and 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequence analysis, respectively, before and after the intervention. Stress-induced increases in a visual analog scale measuring feelings of stress, the total score of abdominal dysfunction, and the number of genes with changes in expression of more than 2-fold in leukocytes were significantly suppressed in the L. casei strain Shirota group compared with those in the placebo group. A significant increase in salivary cortisol levels before the examination was observed only in the placebo group. The administration of L. casei strain Shirota, but not placebo, significantly reduced gastrointestinal symptoms. Moreover, 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing demonstrated that the L. casei strain Shirota group had significantly higher numbers of species, a marker of the alpha-diversity index, in their gut microbiota and a significantly lower percentage of Bacteroidaceae than the placebo group. Our findings indicate that the daily consumption of probiotics, such as L. casei strain Shirota, preserves the diversity of the gut microbiota and may relieve stress-associated responses of abdominal dysfunction in healthy subjects exposed to stressful situations.              Importance:                    A novel clinical trial was conducted with healthy medical students under examination stress conditions. It was demonstrated that the daily consumption of lactic acid bacteria provided health benefits to prevent the onset of stress-associated abdominal symptoms and a good change of gut microbiota in healthy medical students.	0
Phasins are the major polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) granule-associated proteins. They promote bacterial growth and PHA synthesis and affect the number, size, and distribution of the granules. These proteins can be classified in 4 families with distinctive characteristics. Low-resolution structural studies and in silico predictions were performed in order to elucidate the structure of different phasins. Most of these proteins share some common structural features, such as a preponderant α-helix composition, the presence of disordered regions that provide flexibility to the protein, and coiled-coil interacting regions that form oligomerization domains. Due to their amphiphilic nature, these proteins play an important structural function, forming an interphase between the hydrophobic content of PHA granules and the hydrophilic cytoplasm content. Phasins have been observed to affect both PHA accumulation and utilization. Apart from their role as granule structural proteins, phasins have a remarkable variety of additional functions. Different phasins have been determined to (i) activate PHA depolymerization, (ii) increase the expression and activity of PHA synthases, (iii) participate in PHA granule segregation, and (iv) have both in vivo and in vitro chaperone activities. These properties suggest that phasins might play an active role in PHA-related stress protection and fitness enhancement. Due to their granule binding capacity and structural flexibility, several biotechnological applications have been developed using different phasins, increasing the interest in the study of these remarkable proteins.	0
Airborne dispersal of microalgae has largely been a blind spot in environmental biological studies because of their low concentration in the atmosphere and the technical limitations in investigating microalgae from air samples. Recent studies show that airborne microalgae can survive air transportation and interact with the environment, possibly influencing their deposition rates. This minireview presents a summary of these studies and traces the possible route, step by step, from established ecosystems to new habitats through air transportation over a variety of geographic scales. Emission, transportation, deposition, and adaptation to atmospheric stress are discussed, as well as the consequences of their dispersal on health and the environment and state-of-the-art techniques to detect and model airborne microalga dispersal. More-detailed studies on the microalga atmospheric cycle, including, for instance, ice nucleation activity and transport simulations, are crucial for improving our understanding of microalga ecology, identifying microalga interactions with the environment, and preventing unwanted contamination events or invasions.	0
A carbohydrate esterase called glucuronoyl esterase (GE) was discovered 10 years ago in a cellulolytic system of the wood-rotting fungus Schizophyllum commune Genes coding for GEs were subsequently found in a number of microbial genomes, and a new family of carbohydrate esterases (CE15) has been established. The multidomain structures of GEs, together with their catalytic properties on artificial substrates and positive effect on enzymatic saccharification of plant biomass, led to the view that the esterases evolved for hydrolysis of the ester linkages between 4-O-methyl-d-glucuronic acid of plant glucuronoxylans and lignin alcohols, one of the crosslinks in the plant cell walls. This idea of the function of GEs is further supported by the effects of cloning of fungal GEs in plants and by very recently reported evidence for changes in the size of isolated lignin-carbohydrate complexes due to uronic acid de-esterification. These facts make GEs interesting candidates for biotechnological applications in plant biomass processing and genetic modification of plants. This article is a brief summary of current knowledge of these relatively recent and unexplored esterases.	0
Clostridium perfringens is an important pathogen to human and animals and causes a wide array of diseases, including histotoxic and gastrointestinal illnesses. C. perfringens spores are crucial in terms of the pathogenicity of this bacterium because they can survive in a dormant state in the environment and return to being live bacteria when they come in contact with nutrients in food or the human body. Although the strategies to inactivate C. perfringens vegetative cells are effective, the inactivation of C. perfringens spores is still a great challenge. A number of studies have been conducted in the past decade or so toward developing efficient inactivation strategies for C. perfringens spores and vegetative cells, which include physical approaches and the use of chemical preservatives and naturally derived antimicrobial agents. In this review, different inactivation strategies applied to control C. perfringens cells and spores are summarized, and the potential limitations and challenges of these strategies are discussed.	0
Antimony (Sb) is a toxic metalloid that occurs widely at trace concentrations in soil, aquatic systems, and the atmosphere. Nowadays, with the development of its new industrial applications and the corresponding expansion of antimony mining activities, the phenomenon of antimony pollution has become an increasingly serious concern. In recent years, research interest in Sb has been growing and reflects a fundamental scientific concern regarding Sb in the environment. In this review, we summarize the recent research on bacterial antimony transformations, especially those regarding antimony uptake, efflux, antimonite oxidation, and antimonate reduction. We conclude that our current understanding of antimony biochemistry and biogeochemistry is roughly equivalent to where that of arsenic was some 20 years ago. This portends the possibility of future discoveries with regard to the ability of microorganisms to conserve energy for their growth from antimony redox reactions and the isolation of new species of "antimonotrophs."	0
Acetogenic bacteria are a diverse group of strictly anaerobic bacteria that utilize the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway for CO2 fixation and energy conservation. These microorganisms play an important part in the global carbon cycle and are a key component of the anaerobic food web. Their most prominent metabolic feature is autotrophic growth with molecular hydrogen and carbon dioxide as the substrates. However, most members also show an outstanding metabolic flexibility for utilizing a vast variety of different substrates. In contrast to autotrophic growth, which is hardly competitive, metabolic flexibility is seen as a key ability of acetogens to compete in ecosystems and might explain the almost-ubiquitous distribution of acetogenic bacteria in anoxic environments. This review covers the latest findings with respect to the heterotrophic metabolism of acetogenic bacteria, including utilization of carbohydrates, lactate, and different alcohols, especially in the model acetogen Acetobacterium woodii Modularity of metabolism, a key concept of pathway design in synthetic biology, together with electron bifurcation, to overcome energetic barriers, appears to be the basis for the amazing substrate spectrum. At the same time, acetogens depend on only a relatively small number of enzymes to expand the substrate spectrum. We will discuss the energetic advantages of coupling CO2 reduction to fermentations that exploit otherwise-inaccessible substrates and the ecological advantages, as well as the biotechnological applications of the heterotrophic metabolism of acetogens.	0
Tissue biocompatibility of cellulose and its derivatives was examined in two in vivo tests, one for absorbance by living tissue and one for foreign body reaction. The samples examined were regenerated celluloses and cellulose derivatives: methyl cellulose, ethyl cellulose, aminoethyl cellulose, hydroxyethyl cellulose, and cellulosic polyion complexes. The in vivo absorbance by living tissue was found to depend on the degree of crystallinity and the chemical structure of the sample. The foreign body reaction was relatively mild for all the samples examined, showing that cellulose can be converted to biocompatible materials by physical and/or chemical transformation.	0
