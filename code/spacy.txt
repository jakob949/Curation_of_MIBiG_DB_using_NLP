Title: Characterization of a partial duplication of the aflatoxin gene cluster in Aspergillus parasiticus ATCC 56775 Abstract: A partial duplication of the complete aflatoxin gene cluster containing homologues of aflR-aflJ-adhA-estA-norA-ver1and omtB was identified from Aspergillus parasiticus ATCC 56775. The genes, verA-avnA-verB-avfA, between ver1 and omtB in the complete gene cluster, however, were not found. One-hybrid assays showed that the duplicated aflRgene ( aflR2) encoded a protein that could activate transcription just as that encoded by aflR1,the aflR gene in the complete gene cluster. Two-hybrid assays showed that AFLR2 also interacted with a putative coactivator, AFLJ1, at comparable levels to AFLR1. Deletion of aflR1 resulted in the loss of production of aflatoxin precursors, which suggested that aflR2could not completely replace the function of aflR1. Point mutations found in adhA2, pre-termination in ver1B and norA2,and a large deletion in omtB2 probably render these duplicated genes to become nonfunctional. A close examination of the history of isolates reported to have a partial duplication suggested that duplication of the aflatoxin cluster is not a prevalent event.	1
Title: Aflatoxin biosynthesis cluster gene cypA is required for G aflatoxin formation Abstract: Aspergillus flavus isolates produce only aflatoxins B1 and B2, while Aspergillus parasiticus and Aspergillus nomius produce aflatoxins B1, B2, G1, and G2. Sequence comparison of the aflatoxin biosynthesis pathway gene cluster upstream from the polyketide synthase gene, pksA, revealed that A. flavus isolates are missing portions of genes (cypA and norB) predicted to encode, respectively, a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase and an aryl alcohol dehydrogenase. Insertional disruption of cypA in A. parasiticus yielded transformants that lack the ability to produce G aflatoxins but not B aflatoxins. The enzyme encoded by cypA has highest amino acid identity to Gibberella zeae Tri4 (38%), a P450 monooxygenase previously shown to be involved in trichodiene epoxidation. The substrate for CypA may be an intermediate formed by oxidative cleavage of the A ring of O-methylsterigmatocystin by OrdA, the P450 monooxygenase required for formation of aflatoxins B1 and B2.	1
Title: Variability in nitrogen regulation of aflatoxin production by Aspergillus flavus strains Abstract: Aflatoxins are toxic and carcinogenic metabolites of several Aspergillus species. The effect of nitrate on aflatoxin production and expression of the key regulatory genes involved in aflatoxin biosynthesis, aflR and aflJ, were compared among isolates of the S(B) and S(BG) strains of A. flavus. Aflatoxin production by two of the three strain S(B) isolates did not differ significantly between the two media tested, whereas for S(BG) A. flavus isolates, the level of aflatoxins in buffered nitrate medium was as much as 20-fold lower than in ammonium salts medium. Expression of aflR was not significantly affected by growth of cultures in nitrate medium for most of the isolates. However, on nitrate medium, expression of aflJ was 2.6-fold higher for the S(B) isolates than it was on ammonium salts medium, whereas for the S(BG) isolates aflJ expression was 2-fold lower on nitrate than on ammonium salts medium. This difference may result from the presence in the aflJ/aflR intergenic region of S(BG) isolates of fewer putative binding sites (HGATAR sites) for AreA, the positive-acting, wide domain transcription factor involved in regulation of nitrogen metabolism.	1
Title: Degeneration of aflatoxin gene clusters in Aspergillus flavus from Africa and North America Abstract: Aspergillus flavus is the most common causal agent of aflatoxin contamination of food and feed. However, aflatoxin-producing potential varies widely among A. flavus genotypes with many producing no aflatoxins. Some non-aflatoxigenic genotypes are used as biocontrol agents to prevent contamination. Aflatoxin biosynthesis genes are tightly clustered in a highly conserved order. Gene deletions and presence of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in aflatoxin biosynthesis genes are often associated with A. flavus inability to produce aflatoxins. In order to identify mechanisms of non-aflatoxigenicity in non-aflatoxigenic genotypes of value in aflatoxin biocontrol, complete cluster sequences of 35 A. flavus genotypes from Africa and North America were analyzed. Inability of some genotypes to produce aflatoxin resulted from deletion of biosynthesis genes. In other genotypes, non-aflatoxigenicity originated from SNP formation. The process of degeneration differed across the gene cluster; genes involved in early biosynthesis stages were more likely to be deleted while genes involved in later stages displayed high frequencies of SNPs. Comparative analyses of aflatoxin gene clusters provides insight into the diversity of mechanisms of non-aflatoxigenicity in A. flavus genotypes used as biological control agents. The sequences provide resources for both diagnosis of non-aflatoxigenicity and monitoring of biocontrol genotypes during biopesticide manufacture and in the environment.	1
Title: Characterization of the Aspergillus ochraceoroseus aflatoxin/sterigmatocystin biosynthetic gene cluster Abstract: Production of carcinogenic aflatoxins has been reported from members of Aspergillus section Flavi, Aspergillus section Nidulantes and a newly proposed Aspergillus section Ochraceorosei that consists of Aspergillus ochraceoroseus and A. rambellii. Unlike members of section Flavi, A. ochraceoroseus and A. rambellii have been shown to accumulate both aflatoxin (AF) and the aflatoxin precursor sterigmatocystin (ST). Alhough morphologically distinct from A. nidulans, molecular characterization of A. ochraceoroseus AF/ST genes and physiological characteristics of AF/ST production indicated that A. ochraceoroseus is more closely related to A. nidulans than to A. flavus. Knowing that the A. nidulans ST gene cluster is organized differently from the A. flavus AF gene cluster, we determined the genetic organization of the AF/ST biosynthetic cluster in A. ochraceoroseus. Sequencing of overlapping lambda clones and genomic PCR fragments obtained by gene-walking techniques demonstrated that the A. ochraceoroseus AF/ST gene cluster is organized much like the A. nidulans ST gene cluster except that the region from aflN to aflW is located directly upstream of aflC and in reverse orientation such that aflW represents the distal end and aflY the proximal end of the cluster. The A. ochraceoroseus cluster genes demonstrated 62-76% nucleotide identity to their A. nidulans ST cluster gene homologs. Transformation of an A. nidulans aflR mutant with the A. ochraceoroseus aflR restored ST production in A. nidulans transformants. PCR amplification of A. rambellii genomic DNA demonstrated that the AF/ST gene cluster is organized in the same manner as that of A. ochraceoroseus.	1
Title: An iterative type I polyketide synthase PKSN catalyzes synthesis of the decaketide alternapyrone with regio-specific octa-methylation Abstract: A biosynthetic gene cluster containing five genes, alt1-5, was cloned from Alternaria solani, a causal fungus of early blight disease to tomato and potato. Homology searching indicated that the alt1, 2, and 3 genes code for cytochrome P450s and the alt4 gene for a FAD-dependent oxygenase/oxidase. The alt5 gene encodes a polyketide synthase (PKS), named PKSN, that was found to be an iterative type I complex reduced-type PKS with a C-methyltransferase domain. To identify the PKSN function, the alt5 gene was introduced into the fungal host Aspergillus oryzae under an alpha-amylase promoter. The transformant produced a polyketide compound, named alternapyrone, whose structure is shown to be 3,5-dimethyl-4-hydroxy-6-(1,3,5,7,11,13-hexamethyl-3,5,11-pentadecatrienyl)-pyran-2-one. Labeling experiments confirmed that alternapyrone is a decaketide with octa-methylation from methionine on every C(2) unit except the third unit.	1
Title: Illuminating the diversity of aromatic polyketide synthases in Aspergillus nidulans Abstract: Genome sequencing has revealed that fungi have the ability to synthesize many more natural products (NPs) than are currently known, but methods for obtaining suitable expression of NPs have been inadequate. We have developed a successful strategy that bypasses normal regulatory mechanisms. By efficient gene targeting, we have replaced, en masse, the promoters of nonreducing polyketide synthase (NR-PKS) genes, key genes in NP biosynthetic pathways, and other genes necessary for NR-PKS product formation or release. This has allowed us to determine the products of eight NR-PKSs of Aspergillus nidulans, including seven novel compounds, as well as the NR-PKS genes required for the synthesis of the toxins alternariol (8) and cichorine (19).	1
Title: Analysis of the ambruticin and jerangolid gene clusters of Sorangium cellulosum reveals unusual mechanisms of polyketide biosynthesis Abstract: Ambruticins and jerangolids are structurally related antifungal polyketides produced by Sorangium cellulosum strains. Comparative analysis of the gene clusters and characterization of compounds produced by gene knockout strains suggested hypothetical schemes for biosynthesis of these compounds. Polyketide synthase (PKS) architecture suggests that the pyran ring structure common to ambruticins and jerangolids forms by an intramolecular reaction on a PKS-bound intermediate. Disrupting ambM, encoding a discrete enzyme homologous to PKS C-methyltransferase domains, gave 15-desmethylambruticins. Thus, AmbM is required for C-methylation, but not pyran ring formation. Several steps in the post-PKS modification of ambruticin involve new enzymology. Remarkably, the methylcyclopropane ring and putative carbon atom excision during ambruticin biosynthesis apparently occur on the PKS assembly line. The mechanism probably involves a Favorskii rearrangement, but further work is required to elucidate these complex events.	1
Title: Amphotericin biosynthesis in Streptomyces nodosus: deductions from analysis of polyketide synthase and late genes Abstract: Background:                       The polyene macrolide amphotericin B is produced by Streptomyces nodosus ATCC14899. Amphotericin B is a potent antifungal antibiotic and has activity against some viruses, protozoans and prions. Treatment of systemic fungal infections with amphotericin B is complicated by its low water-solubility and side effects which include severe nephrotoxicity. Analogues with improved properties could be generated by manipulating amphotericin biosynthetic genes in S. nodosus.                  Results:                       A large polyketide synthase gene cluster was cloned from total cellular DNA of S. nodosus. Nucleotide sequence analysis of 113193 bp of this region revealed six large polyketide synthase genes as well as genes for two cytochrome P450 enzymes, two ABC transporter proteins, and genes involved in biosynthesis and attachment of mycosamine. Phage KC515-mediated gene disruption was used to show that this region is involved in amphotericin production.                  Conclusions:                       The availability of these genes and the development of a method for gene disruption and replacement in S. nodosus should allow production of novel amphotericins. A panel of analogues could lead to identification of derivatives with increased solubility, improved biological activity and reduced toxicity.	1
Title: Biosynthesis of anatoxin-a and analogues (anatoxins) in cyanobacteria Abstract: Freshwater cyanobacteria produce secondary metabolites that are toxic to humans and animals, the so-called cyanotoxins. Among them, anatoxin-a and homoanatoxin-a are potent neurotoxins that are agonists of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. These alkaloids provoke a rapid death if ingested at low doses. Recently, the cluster of genes responsible for the biosynthesis of these toxins, the ana cluster, has been identified in Oscillatoria sp. PCC 6506, and a biosynthetic pathway was proposed. This biosynthesis was reconstituted in vitro using purified enzymes confirming the predicted pathway. One of the enzymes, AnaB a prolyl-acyl carrier protein oxidase, was crystallized and its three dimensional structure solved confirming its reaction mechanism. Three other ana clusters have now been identified and sequenced in other cyanobacteria. These clusters show similarities and some differences suggesting a common evolutionary origin. In particular, the cluster from Cylindrospermum stagnale PCC 7417, possesses an extra gene coding for an F420-dependent oxidoreductase that is likely involved in the biosynthesis of dihydroanatoxin-a. This review summarizes all these new data and discusses them in relation to the production of anatoxins in the environment.	1
Title: Structure of the prolyl-acyl carrier protein oxidase involved in the biosynthesis of the cyanotoxin anatoxin-a Abstract: Anatoxin-a and homoanatoxin-a are two potent cyanobacterial neurotoxins biosynthesized from L-proline by a short pathway involving polyketide synthases. Proline is first loaded onto AnaD, an acyl carrier protein, and prolyl-AnaD is then oxidized to 1-pyrroline-5-carboxyl-AnaD by a flavoprotein, AnaB. Three polyketide synthases then transform this imine into anatoxin-a or homoanatoxin-a. AnaB was crystallized in its holo form and its three-dimensional structure was determined by X-ray diffraction at 2.8 Å resolution. AnaB is a homotetramer and its fold is very similar to that of the acyl-CoA dehydrogenases (ACADs). The active-site base of AnaB, Glu244, superimposed very well with that of human isovaleryl-CoA dehydrogenase, confirming previous site-directed mutagenesis experiments and mechanistic proposals. The substrate-binding site of AnaB is small and is likely to be fitted for the pyrrolidine ring of proline. However, in contrast to ACADs, which use an electron-transport protein, AnaB uses molecular oxygen as the electron acceptor, as in acyl-CoA oxidases. Calculation of the solvent-accessible surface area around the FAD in AnaB and in several homologues showed that it is significantly larger in AnaB than in its homologues. A protonated histidine near the FAD in AnaB is likely to participate in oxygen activation. Furthermore, an array of water molecules detected in the AnaB structure suggests a possible path for molecular oxygen towards FAD. This is consistent with AnaB being an oxidase rather than a dehydrogenase. The structure of AnaB is the first to be described for a prolyl-ACP oxidase and it will contribute to defining the structural basis responsible for oxygen reactivity in flavoenzymes.	1
Title: Insights into the reaction mechanism of the prolyl-acyl carrier protein oxidase involved in anatoxin-a and homoanatoxin-a biosynthesis Abstract: Anatoxin-a and homoanatoxin-a are two potent cyanobacterial neurotoxins. We recently reported the identification of the gene cluster responsible for the biosynthesis of these toxins as well as the in-vitro reconstitution of the first steps of this biosynthesis. We now report experimental evidence supporting the proposed reaction mechanism of AnaB, a flavoprotein homologous to acyl-CoA dehydrogenase. AnaB catalyzes the two-electron oxidation of prolyl-AnaD, which is proline linked to the acyl carrier protein holo-AnaD, to dehydroprolyl-AnaD using oxygen as the second substrate. AnaB is thus an oxidase. By using liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), we have identified and characterized dehydroprolyl-AnaD, the AnaB product. We estimated an apparent catalytic constant of 1 min(-1) for AnaB catalysis. We synthesized several deuterium-labeled prolines and enzymatically transformed them into their corresponding prolyl-AnaD. These deuterium-labeled prolyl-AnaDs were oxidized in the presence of AnaB, and the deuterium labeling in the remaining substrate and in the product was determined by LC-MS/MS. The data supported a reaction mechanism starting with a rapid enolization followed by a slow oxidation to give the conjugated imine, which in turn was isomerized to pyrroline-5-carboxyl-AnaD. We also showed that cis- and trans-4-fluoro-L-prolyl-AnaD and 3,4-dehydro-L-prolyl-AnaD were transformed into pyrrole-2-carboxyl-AnaD by AnaB. Thus, the 4-fluoro-analogues experienced a β-elimination supporting the AnaB-catalyzed aza-allylic isomerization. We identified by sequence alignment the AnaB active site base, Glu244. We produced, purified, and characterized the E244A AnaB mutant, which is inactive, supporting the catalytic role of E244 as a base.	1
Title: The genome sequence of the cyanobacterium Oscillatoria sp. PCC 6506 reveals several gene clusters responsible for the biosynthesis of toxins and secondary metabolites Abstract: We report a draft sequence of the genome of Oscillatoria sp. PCC 6506, a cyanobacterium that produces anatoxin-a and homoanatoxin-a, two neurotoxins, and cylindrospermopsin, a cytotoxin. Beside the clusters of genes responsible for the biosynthesis of these toxins, we have found other clusters of genes likely involved in the biosynthesis of not-yet-identified secondary metabolites.	1
Title: In vitro reconstitution of the first steps of anatoxin-a biosynthesis in Oscillatoria PCC 6506: from free L-proline to acyl carrier protein bound dehydroproline Abstract: Anatoxin-a and homoanatoxin-a are two potent cyanobacterial neurotoxins. We recently reported the identification of the gene cluster responsible for the biosynthesis of these toxins in cyanobacteria and proposed a biosynthetic scheme starting from L-proline and involving three polyketide synthases for which the starter would be (S)-1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate bound to an acyl carrier protein, AnaD. We now report the in vitro reconstitution of the first steps of this biosynthesis in Oscillatoria PCC 6506. We identified in PCC 6506 the gene coding for an Sfp-like phosphopantetheinyl transferase and purified the gene product, OsPPT, that catalyzed the transfer of the phosphopantetheinyl arm to the serine 41 of AnaD. The pure adenylation protein AnaC loaded L-proline on holo-AnaD and was specific for L-proline (K(m) = 0.97 mM, k(cat) = 68 min(-1)) among the 20 natural amino acids. Among six close structural analogues of L-proline, including (S)-1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate, we only found 3,4-dehydro-L-proline to be an alternate substrate for AnaC (K(m) = 1.5 mM, k(cat) = 29 min(-1)). The putative prolyl-AnaD dehydrogenase, AnaB, purified to homogeneity as a histidine-tagged protein, showed an absorption spectrum characteristic of FAD-containing proteins. It oxidized prolyl-AnaD to dehydroprolyl-AnaD as shown by tryptic digestion of the protein followed by liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry. Alignment of the amino acid sequence of this dehydrogenase with related enzymes showed that AnaB belongs to the acyl-CoA dehydrogenase superfamily and thus probably catalyzes an alpha-beta-dehydrogenation of the thioester-bound proline followed by an aza-allylic isomerization to yield (S)-pyrroline-5-carboxyl-AnaD, the proposed starter for the subsequent polyketide synthase, AnaE.	1
Title: Evidence that biosynthesis of the neurotoxic alkaloids anatoxin-a and homoanatoxin-a in the cyanobacterium Oscillatoria PCC 6506 occurs on a modular polyketide synthase initiated by L-proline Abstract: Anatoxin-a and homoanatoxin-a are potent neurotoxins produced by cyanobacteria such as Oscillatoria PCC 6506. Sequencing of the genome of this strain is underway, and we have identified a 29 kb DNA fragment containing a sequence called ks2 that we previously showed to be specific to Oscillatoria cyanobacteria producing anatoxin-a and homoanatoxin-a. Bioinformatic analysis of this 29 kb fragment revealed a cluster of genes, which were annotated. The function assigned to the products of eight contiguous genes, from anaA to anaH, provides a clue to the biosynthesis of anatoxin-a and homoanatoxin-a. Proline is first loaded on an acyl carrier protein and its five-membered cycle oxidized to the pyrroline oxidation state. This activated ring is then successively loaded on three polyketide synthase modules for elongation, reduction, cyclization, and methylation. The final step is the hydrolysis of the thioester with subsequent decarboxylation. GC-MS and NMR analyses of homoanatoxin-a produced by PCC 6506 using labeled precursors confirm that proline is very likely the starter of these polyketide synthases. Using specific PCR amplifications, we have also shown that the anaC, anaE, anaF, and anaG genes are always present in the genome of cyanobacteria producing anatoxin-a and homoanatoxin-a and absent in nonproducing strains. Histidine-tagged AnaC was purified to homogeneity and showed to catalyze the loading of proline on purified histidine-tagged AnaD that had been previously transformed into its holo form using the Bacillus subtilis Sfp phosphopantetheinyl transferase. All of these data provide strong evidence that we have successfully identified the gene cluster responsible for the production of anatoxin-a and homoanatoxin-a in Oscillatoria PCC 6506.	1
Title: Identification of a polyketide synthase coding sequence specific for anatoxin-a-producing Oscillatoria cyanobacteria Abstract: We report the identification of a sequence from the genome of Oscillatoria sp. strain PCC 6506 coding for a polyketide synthase. Using 50 axenic cyanobacteria, we found this sequence only in the genomes of Oscillatoria strains producing anatoxin-a or homoanatoxin-a, indicating its likely involvement in the biosynthesis of these toxins.	1
Title: Anatoxin-a synthetase gene cluster of the cyanobacterium Anabaena sp. strain 37 and molecular methods to detect potential producers Abstract: Cyanobacterial mass occurrences are common in fresh and brackish waters. They pose a threat to water users due to toxins frequently produced by the cyanobacterial species present. Anatoxin-a and homoanatoxin-a are neurotoxins synthesized by various cyanobacteria, e.g., Anabaena, Oscillatoria, and Aphanizomenon. The biosynthesis of these toxins and the genes involved in anatoxin production were recently described for Oscillatoria sp. strain PCC 6506 (A. Méjean et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 131:7512-7513, 2009). In this study, we identified the anatoxin synthetase gene cluster (anaA to anaG and orf1; 29 kb) in Anabaena sp. strain 37. The gene (81.6% to 89.2%) and amino acid (78.8% to 86.9%) sequences were highly similar to those of Oscillatoria sp. PCC 6506, while the organization of the genes differed. Molecular detection methods for potential anatoxin-a and homoanatoxin-a producers of the genera Anabaena, Aphanizomenon, and Oscillatoria were developed by designing primers to recognize the anaC gene. Anabaena and Oscillatoria anaC genes were specifically identified in several cyanobacterial strains by PCR. Restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis of the anaC amplicons enabled simultaneous identification of three producer genera: Anabaena, Oscillatoria, and Aphanizomenon. The molecular methods developed in this study revealed the presence of both Anabaena and Oscillatoria as potential anatoxin producers in Finnish fresh waters and the Baltic Sea; they could be applied for surveys of these neurotoxin producers in other aquatic environments.	1
Title: Improving the coverage of the cyanobacterial phylum using diversity-driven genome sequencing Abstract: The cyanobacterial phylum encompasses oxygenic photosynthetic prokaryotes of a great breadth of morphologies and ecologies; they play key roles in global carbon and nitrogen cycles. The chloroplasts of all photosynthetic eukaryotes can trace their ancestry to cyanobacteria. Cyanobacteria also attract considerable interest as platforms for "green" biotechnology and biofuels. To explore the molecular basis of their different phenotypes and biochemical capabilities, we sequenced the genomes of 54 phylogenetically and phenotypically diverse cyanobacterial strains. Comparison of cyanobacterial genomes reveals the molecular basis for many aspects of cyanobacterial ecophysiological diversity, as well as the convergence of complex morphologies without the acquisition of novel proteins. This phylum-wide study highlights the benefits of diversity-driven genome sequencing, identifying more than 21,000 cyanobacterial proteins with no detectable similarity to known proteins, and foregrounds the diversity of light-harvesting proteins and gene clusters for secondary metabolite biosynthesis. Additionally, our results provide insight into the distribution of genes of cyanobacterial origin in eukaryotic nuclear genomes. Moreover, this study doubles both the amount and the phylogenetic diversity of cyanobacterial genome sequence data. Given the exponentially growing number of sequenced genomes, this diversity-driven study demonstrates the perspective gained by comparing disparate yet related genomes in a phylum-wide context and the insights that are gained from it.	1
Title: Engineered biosynthesis of hybrid macrolide polyketides containing D-angolosamine and D-mycaminose moieties Abstract: The glycosylation of natural product scaffolds with highly modified deoxysugars is often essential for their biological activity, being responsible for specific contacts to molecular targets and significantly affecting their pharmacokinetic properties. In order to provide tools for the targeted alteration of natural product glycosylation patterns, significant strides have been made to understand the biosynthesis of activated deoxysugars and their transfer. We report here efforts towards the production of plasmid-borne biosynthetic gene cassettes capable of producing TDP-activated forms of D-mycaminose, D-angolosamine and D-desosamine. We additionally describe the transfer of these deoxysugars to macrolide aglycones using the glycosyl transferases EryCIII, TylMII and AngMII, which display usefully broad substrate tolerance.	1
Title: The biosynthetic gene cluster of the maytansinoid antitumor agent ansamitocin from Actinosynnema pretiosum Abstract: Maytansinoids are potent antitumor agents found in plants and microorganisms. To elucidate their biosynthesis at the biochemical and genetic level and to set the stage for their structure modification through genetic engineering, we have cloned two gene clusters required for the biosynthesis of the maytansinoid, ansamitocin, from a cosmid library of Actinosynnema pretiosum ssp. auranticum ATCC 31565. This is a rare case in which the genes involved in the formation of a secondary metabolite are dispersed in separate regions in an Actinomycete. A set of genes, asm22-24, asm43-45, and asm47, was identified for the biosynthesis of the starter unit, 3-amino-5-hydroxybenzoic acid (AHBA). Remarkably, there are two AHBA synthase gene homologues, which may have different functions in AHBA formation. Four type I polyketide synthase genes, asmA-D, followed by the downloading asm9, together encode eight homologous sets of enzyme activities (modules), each catalyzing a specific round of chain initiation, elongation, or termination steps, which assemble the ansamitocin polyketide backbone. Another set of genes, asm13-17, encodes the formation of an unusual "methoxymalonate" polyketide chain extension unit that, notably, seems to be synthesized on a dedicated acyl carrier protein rather than as a CoA thioester. Additional ORFs are involved in postsynthetic modifications of the initial polyketide synthase product, which include methylations, an epoxidation, an aromatic chlorination, and the introduction of acyl and carbamoyl groups. Tentative functions of several asm genes were confirmed by inactivation and heterologous expression.	1
Title: Biosynthesis of the Apoptolidins in Nocardiopsis sp. FU 40 Abstract: The apoptolidins are 20/21-membered macrolides produced by Nocardiopsis sp. FU40. Several members of this family are potent and remarkably selective inducers of apoptosis in cancer cell lines, likely via a distinct mitochondria associated target. To investigate the biosynthesis of this natural product, the complete genome of the apoptolidin producer Nocardiopsis sp. FU40 was sequenced and a 116 Kb region was identified containing a putative apoptolidin biosynthetic gene cluster. The apoptolidin gene cluster comprises a type I polyketide synthase, with 13 homologating modules, apparently initiated in an unprecedented fashion via transfer from a methoxymalonyl-acyl carrier protein loading module. Spanning approximately 39 open reading frames, the gene cluster was cloned into a series of overlapping cosmids and functionally validated by targeted gene disruption experiments in the producing organism. Disruption of putative PKS and P(450) genes delineated the roles of these genes in apoptolidin biosynthesis and chemical complementation studies demonstrated intact biosynthesis peripheral to the disrupted genes. This work provides insight into details of the biosynthesis of this biologically significant natural product and provides a basis for future mutasynthetic methods for the generation of non-natural apopotolidins.	1
Title: A gene cluster containing two fungal polyketide synthases encodes the biosynthetic pathway for a polyketide, asperfuranone, in Aspergillus nidulans Abstract: The genome sequencing of Aspergillus species including A. nidulans reveals that the products of many of the secondary metabolism pathways in these fungi have not been elucidated. Our examination of the 27 polyketide synthases (PKS) in A. nidulans revealed that one highly reduced PKS (HR-PKS, AN1034.3) and one nonreduced PKS (NR-PKS, AN1036.3) are located next to each other in the genome. Since no known A. nidulans secondary metabolites could be produced by two PKS enzymes, we hypothesized that this cryptic gene cluster produces an unknown natural product. Indeed after numerous attempts we found that the products from this cluster could not be detected under normal laboratory culture conditions in wild type strains. Closer examination of the gene cluster revealed a gene with high homology to a citrinin biosynthesis transcriptional activator (CtnR, 32% identity/47% similarity), a fungal transcription activator located next to the two PKSs. We replaced the promoter of the transcription activator with the inducible alcA promoter, which enabled the production of a novel polyketide that we have named asperfuranone. A series of gene deletions has allowed us to confirm that the two PKSs together with five additional genes comprise the asperfuranone biosynthetic pathway and leads us to propose a biosynthetic pathway for asperfuranone. Our results confirm and substantiate the potential to discover novel compounds even from a well-studied fungus by using a genomic mining approach.	1
Title: From genetic diversity to metabolic unity: studies on the biosynthesis of aurafurones and aurafuron-like structures in myxobacteria and streptomycetes Abstract: The myxobacterial polyketide secondary metabolites aurafuron A and B were identified by genome mining in the myxobacterial strain Stigmatella aurantiaca DW4/3-1. The compounds contain an unusual furanone moiety and resemble metabolites isolated from soil-dwelling and marine actinobacteria, a fungus and mollusks. We describe here the cloning and functional analysis of the aurafuron biosynthetic gene cluster, including site-directed mutagenesis and feeding studies using labeled precursors. The polyketide core of the aurafurones is assembled by a modular polyketide synthase (PKS). As with many such systems described from myxobacteria, the aurafuron PKS exhibits a number of unusual features, including the apparent iterative use of a module, redundant modules and domains, a trans acting dehydratase and the absence of a terminal thioesterase domain. Four oxidoreductases are encoded within the gene locus, some of which likely participate in formation of the furanone moiety via a Baeyer-Villiger type oxidation. Indeed, inactivation of a gene encoding a cytochrome P(450) monooxygenase completely abolished production of both compounds. We also compare the complete gene locus to biosynthetic gene clusters from two Streptomyces sp., which produce close structural analogues of the aurafurones. A portion of the post-PKS biosynthetic machinery is strikingly similar in all three cases, in contrast to the PKS genes, which are highly divergent. Phylogenetic analysis of the ketosynthase domains further indicates that the PKSs have developed independently (polyphyletically) during evolution. These findings point to a currently unknown but important biological function of aurafuron-like compounds for the producing organisms.	1
Title: Iteration as programmed event during polyketide assembly; molecular analysis of the aureothin biosynthesis gene cluster Abstract: Analysis of the type I modular polyketide synthase (PKS) involved in the biosynthesis of the rare nitroaryl polyketide metabolite aureothin (aur) from Streptomyces thioluteus HKI-227 has revealed only four modules to catalyze the five polyketide chain extensions required. By heterologous expression of the aur PKS cluster, direct evidence was obtained that these modules were sufficient to support aureothin biosynthesis. It appears that one module catalyzes two successive cycles of chain extension, one of the first examples of a PKS in which such iteration or "stuttering" is required to produce the normal polyketide product. In addition, lack of a specified loading domain implicates a novel PKS priming mechanism involving the unique p-nitrobenzoate starter unit. The 27 kb aur gene cluster also encodes a novel N-oxidase, which may represent the first member of a new family of such enzymes.	1
Title: Biosynthetic origin of the rare nitroaryl moiety of the polyketide antibiotic aureothin: involvement of an unprecedented N-oxygenase Abstract: The antibiotic aureothin is a rare natural nitroaromatic compound produced by Streptomyces thioluteus. By labeling experiments, we demonstrate for the first time that p-nitrobenzoate (PNBA) serves as a polyketide synthase starter unit. Cloning, heterologous expression, and inactivation experiments reveal that this unusual primer is synthesized from p-aminobenzoate (PABA) by means of AurF, a novel N-oxygenase.	1
Title: Formation of the aureothin tetrahydrofuran ring by a bifunctional cytochrome p450 monooxygenase Abstract: The polyketide antibiotic aureothin, produced by Streptomyces thioluteus, is equipped with a rare exomethylene-tetrahydrofuran moiety. Cloning, heterologous expression, and inactivation experiments reveal that AurH, a bifunctional cytochrome P450 monooxygenase, is required and sufficient for the stereoselective synthesis of the furan ring, involving the subsequent formation of two new C-O bonds.	1
Title: Functional analysis of the aureothin iterative type I polyketide synthase Abstract: The modular-type polyketide synthase (PKS) that is involved in aureothin (aur) biosynthesis represents one of the first examples in which a single PKS module (AurA) is used in an iterative fashion. Here we report on the heterologous expression of an engineered AurAB fusion protein that unequivocally proves the iterative nature of AurA. In addition, point mutations reveal that aur PKS module 4 participates in polyketide biosynthesis despite its aberrant acyltransferase domain.	1
Title: Non-colinear polyketide biosynthesis in the aureothin and neoaureothin pathways: an evolutionary perspective Abstract: Aureothin and neoaureothin (spectinabilin) represent rare nitroaryl-substituted polyketide metabolites from Streptomyces thioluteus and Streptomyces orinoci, respectively, which only differ in the lengths of the polyene backbones. Cloning and sequencing of the 39 kb neoaureothin (nor) biosynthesis gene cluster and its comparison with the aureothin (aur) pathway genes revealed that both polyketide synthase (PKS) assembly lines are remarkably similar. In both cases the module architecture breaks with the principle of colinearity, as individual PKS modules are used in an iterative fashion. Parsimony and neighbour-joining phylogenetic studies provided insights into the evolutionary process that led to the programming of these unusual type I PKS systems and to prediction of which modules act iteratively. The iterative function of the first module in the neoaureothin pathway, NorA, was confirmed by a successful cross-complementation.	1
Title: Structure and action of the N-oxygenase AurF from Streptomyces thioluteus Abstract: Nitro groups are found in a number of bioactive compounds. Most of them arise by a stepwise mono-oxygenation of amino groups. One of the involved enzymes is AurF participating in the biosynthesis of aureothin. Its structure was established at 2.1 A resolution showing a homodimer with a binuclear manganese cluster. The enzyme preparation, which yielded the analyzed crystals, showed activity using in vitro and in vivo assays. Chain fold and cluster are homologous with ribonucleotide reductase subunit R2 and related enzymes. The two manganese ions and an iron content of about 15% were established by anomalous X-ray diffraction. A comparison of the cluster with more common di-iron clusters suggested an additional histidine in the coordination sphere to cause the preference for manganese over iron. There is no oxo-bridge. The substrate p-amino-benzoate was modeled into the active center. The model is supported by mutant activity measurements. It shows the geometry of the reaction and explains the established substrate spectrum.	1
Title: In vitro reconstitution and crystal structure of p-aminobenzoate N-oxygenase (AurF) involved in aureothin biosynthesis Abstract: p-Aminobenzoate N-oxygenase (AurF) from Streptomyces thioluteus catalyzes the formation of unusual polyketide synthase starter unit p-nitrobenzoic acid (pNBA) from p-aminobenzoic acid (pABA) in the biosynthesis of antibiotic aureothin. AurF is a metalloenzyme, but its native enzymatic activity has not been demonstrated in vitro, and its catalytic mechanism is unclear. In addition, the nature of the cofactor remains a controversy. Here, we report the in vitro reconstitution of the AurF enzyme activity, the crystal structure of AurF in the oxidized state, and the cocrystal structure of AurF with its product pNBA. Our combined biochemical and structural analysis unequivocally indicates that AurF is a non-heme di-iron monooxygenase that catalyzes sequential oxidation of aminoarenes to nitroarenes via hydroxylamine and nitroso intermediates.	1
Title: Four-electron oxidation of p-hydroxylaminobenzoate to p-nitrobenzoate by a peroxodiferric complex in AurF from Streptomyces thioluteus Abstract: The nonheme di-iron oxygenase, AurF, converts p-aminobenzoate (Ar-NH(2), where Ar = 4-carboxyphenyl) to p-nitrobenzoate (Ar-NO(2)) in the biosynthesis of the antibiotic, aureothin, by Streptomyces thioluteus. It has been reported that this net six-electron oxidation proceeds in three consecutive, two-electron steps, through p-hydroxylaminobenzoate (Ar-NHOH) and p-nitrosobenzoate (Ar-NO) intermediates, with each step requiring one equivalent of O(2) and two exogenous reducing equivalents. We recently demonstrated that a peroxodiiron(III/III) complex (peroxo- -AurF) formed by addition of O(2) to the diiron(II/II) enzyme ( -AurF) effects the initial oxidation of Ar-NH(2), generating a mu-(oxo)diiron(III/III) form of the enzyme (mu-oxo- -AurF) and (presumably) Ar-NHOH. Here we show that peroxo- -AurF also oxidizes Ar-NHOH. Unexpectedly, this reaction proceeds through to the Ar-NO(2) final product, a four-electron oxidation, and produces -AurF, with which O(2) can combine to regenerate peroxo- -AurF. Thus, conversion of Ar-NHOH to Ar-NO(2) requires only a single equivalent of O(2) and (starting from -AurF or peroxo- -AurF) is fully catalytic in the absence of exogenous reducing equivalents, by contrast to the published stoichiometry. This novel type of four-electron N-oxidation is likely also to occur in the reaction sequences of nitro-installing di-iron amine oxygenases in the biosyntheses of other natural products.	1
Title: Interchenar retrotransfer of aureothin intermediates in an iterative polyketide synthase module Abstract: The course of the enigmatic iterative use of a polyketide synthase module was deduced from targeted domain inactivation in the aureothin assembly line. Mutational analyses revealed that the N-terminus of AurA is not involved in the iteration process, ruling out an ACP-ACP shuttle. Furthermore, an AurA(KS°, ACP°)-AurA(AT(0)) heterodimer proved to be nonfunctional, whereas aureothin production was restored in a ΔaurA mutant complemented with AurA(KS°)-AurA(ACP°). This finding supports a model according to which the ACP-bound polyketide intermediate is transferred back to the KS domain on the opposite PKS strand.	1
Title: Rational design of modular polyketide synthases: morphing the aureothin pathway into a luteoreticulin assembly line Abstract: The unusual nitro-substituted polyketides aureothin, neoaureothin (spectinabilin), and luteoreticulin, which are produced by diverse Streptomyces species, point to a joint evolution. Through rational genetic recombination and domain exchanges we have successfully reprogrammed the modular (type I) aur polyketide synthase (PKS) into a synthase that generates luteoreticulin. This is the first rational transformation of a modular PKS to produce a complex polyketide that was initially isolated from a different bacterium. A unique aspect of this synthetic biology approach is that we exclusively used genes from a single biosynthesis gene cluster to design the artificial pathway, an avenue that likely emulates natural evolutionary processes. Furthermore, an unexpected, context-dependent switch in the regiospecificity of a pyrone methyl transferase was observed. We also describe an unprecedented scenario where an AT domain iteratively loads an extender unit onto the cognate ACP and the downstream ACP. This aberrant function is a novel case of non-colinear behavior of PKS domains.	1
Title: Exploiting enzymatic promiscuity to engineer a focused library of highly selective antifungal and antiproliferative aureothin analogues Abstract: Aureothin is a shikimate-polyketide hybrid metabolite from Streptomyces thioluteus with a rare nitroaryl moiety, a chiral tetrahydrofuran ring, and an O-methylated pyrone ring. The antimicrobial and antitumor activities of aureothin have caught our interest in modulating its structure as well as its bioactivity profile. In an integrated approach using mutasynthesis, biotransformation, and combinatorial biosynthesis, a defined library of aureothin analogues was generated. The promiscuity of the polyketide synthase assembly line toward different starter units and the plasticity of the pyrone and tetrahydrofuran ring formation were exploited. A selection of 15 new aureothin analogues with modifications at the aryl residue, the pyrone ring, and the oxygenated backbone was produced on a preparative scale and fully characterized. Remarkably, various new aureothin derivatives are less cytotoxic than aureothin but have improved antiproliferative activities. Furthermore, we found that the THF ring is crucial for the remarkably selective activity of aureothin analogues against certain pathogenic fungi.	1
Title: Organization of the biosynthetic gene cluster for the polyketide anthelmintic macrolide avermectin in Streptomyces avermitilis Abstract: Analysis of the gene cluster from Streptomyces avermitilis that governs the biosynthesis of the polyketide anthelmintic avermectin revealed that it contains four large ORFs encoding giant multifunctional polypeptides of the avermectin polyketide synthase (AVES 1, AVES 2, AVES 3, and AVES 4). These clustered polyketide synthase genes responsible for avermectin biosynthesis together encode 12 homologous sets of enzyme activities (modules), each catalyzing a specific round of polyketide chain elongation. The clustered genes encoding polyketide synthase are organized as two sets of six modular repeats, aveA1-aveA2 and aveA3-aveA4, which are convergently transcribed. The total of 55 constituent active sites makes this the most complex multifunctional enzyme system identified to date. The sequenced DNA region contains 14 additional ORFs, some of which encode polypeptides governing other key steps in avermectin biosynthesis. Between the two sets of polyketide synthase genes lie two genes involved in postpolyketide modification, one of which encodes cynthochrome P450 hydroxylase that probably catalyzes furan ring formation at C6 to C8a. Immediately right of the large polyketide synthase genes is a set of genes involved in oleandrose biosynthesis and its transglycosylation to polyketide-derived aglycons. This cluster includes nine genes, but one is not functional in the biosynthesis of avermectin. On the left side of polyketide synthase genes, two ORFs encoding methyltransferase and nonpolyketide synthase ketoreductase involved in postpolyketide modification are located to the left of the polyketide synthase genes, and an adjacent gene encodes a regulatory function that may be involved in activation of the transcription of avermectin biosynthetic genes.	1
Title: Biosynthesis of the orthosomycin antibiotic avilamycin A: deductions from the molecular analysis of the avi biosynthetic gene cluster of Streptomyces viridochromogenes Tü57 and production of new antibiotics Abstract: Background:                       Streptomyces viridochromogenes Tü57 is the producer of avilamycin A. The antibiotic consists of a heptasaccharide side chain and a polyketide-derived dichloroisoeverninic acid as aglycone. Molecular cloning and characterization of the genes governing the avilamycin A biosynthesis is of major interest as this information might set the direction for the development of new antimicrobial agents.                  Results:                       A 60-kb section of the S. viridochromogenes Tü57 chromosome containing genes involved in avilamycin biosynthesis was sequenced. Analysis of the DNA sequence revealed 54 open reading frames. Based on the putative function of the gene products a model for avilamycin biosynthesis is proposed. Inactivation of aviG4 and aviH, encoding a methyltransferase and a halogenase, respectively, prevented the mutant strains from producing the complete dichloroisoeverninic acid moiety resulting in the accumulation of new antibiotics named gavibamycins.                  Conclusions:                       The avilamycin A biosynthetic gene cluster represents an interesting system to study the formation and attachment of unusual deoxysugars. Several enzymes putatively responsible for specific steps of this pathway could be assigned. Two genes encoding enzymes involved in post-PKS tailoring reactions were deleted allowing the production of new analogues of avilamycin A.	1
Title: Analysis of a C-methyltransferase gene (aviG1) involved in avilamycin biosynthesis in Streptomyces viridochromogenes Tü57 and complementation of a Saccharopolyspora erythraea eryBIII mutant by aviG1 Abstract: Streptomyces viridochromogenes Tü57 is the principal producer of avilamycin A. aviG1, a putative methyltransferase gene, was detected in the avilamycin biosynthetic gene cluster. To determine the function of aviG1, a targeted gene inactivation experiment was performed. The resulting chromosomal mutant, carrying an in-frame deletion in aviG1, was deficient in avilamycin production. aviG1 was used to complement an eryBIII mutant of the erythromycin A producer Saccharopolyspora erythraea [Gaisser, S., Bohm, G. A., Doumith, M., Raynal, M. C., Dhillon, N., Cortes, J. & Leadlay, P. F. (1998). Mol Gen Genet 258, 78-88]. The presence of erythromycin A in the culture supernatant of the complemented mutant indicated that L-mycarose biosynthesis could be restored and that AviG1 could take over the function of the C-methyltransferase EryBIII.	1
Title: Novel avilamycin derivatives with improved polarity generated by targeted gene disruption Abstract: The oligosaccharide antibiotics avilamycin A and C are produced by Streptomyces viridochromogenes Tu57. Both consist of a heptasaccharide chain, which is attached to a polyketide-derived dichloroisoeverninic acid moiety. They show excellent antibiotic activity against Gram-positive bacteria. Both molecules are modified by O-methylation at different positions, which contributes to poor water solubility and difficulties in galenical drug development. In order to generate novel avilamycin derivatives with improved polarity and improved pharmacokinetic properties, we generated a series of mutants with one, two, or three mutated methyltransferase genes. Based on the structure of the novel avilamycin derivatives, the exact function of three methyltransferases, AviG2, AviG5, and AviG6, involved in avilamycin biosynthesis could be assigned.	1
Title: Genes involved in formation and attachment of a two-carbon chain as a component of eurekanate, a branched-chain sugar moiety of avilamycin A Abstract: Eurekanate belongs to the important class of branched-chain carbohydrates present in a wide variety of natural sources. It is a component of avilamycin A, a potent inhibitor of bacterial protein synthesis targeting the 50S ribosomal subunit. The present work provides experimental proof for the function of two genes of the avilamycin biosynthetic gene cluster, aviB1 and aviO2, that are both involved in avilamycin structure modification. The functions of both genes were identified by gene inactivation experiments and nuclear magnetic resonance analyses of extracts produced by the mutants. We suggest that both AviO2 and AviB1 are involved in the biosynthesis of eurekanate within avilamycin biosynthesis. Moreover, two other genes (aviO1 and aviO3) have been inactivated, resulting in a breakdown of avilamycin production in the mutants ITO1 and ITO3, which clearly shows the essential role of both enzymes in avilamycin biosynthesis. The exact functions of both aviO1 and aviO3 remained unknown.	1
Title: Genes encoding enzymes responsible for biosynthesis of L-lyxose and attachment of eurekanate during avilamycin biosynthesis Abstract: The oligosaccharide antibiotic avilamycin A is composed of a polyketide-derived dichloroisoeverninic acid moiety attached to a heptasaccharide chain consisting of six hexoses and one unusual pentose moiety. We describe the generation of mutant strains of the avilamycin producer defective in different sugar biosynthetic genes. Inactivation of two genes (aviD and aviE2) resulted in the breakdown of the avilamycin biosynthesis. In contrast, avilamycin production was not influenced in an aviP mutant. Inactivation of aviGT4 resulted in a mutant that accumulated a novel avilamycin derivative lacking the terminal eurekanate residue. Finally, AviE2 was expressed in Escherichia coli and the gene product was characterized biochemically. AviE2 was shown to convert UDP-D-glucuronic acid to UDP-D-xylose, indicating that the pentose residue of avilamycin A is derived from D-glucose and not from D-ribose. Here we report a UDP-D-glucuronic acid decarboxylase in actinomycetes.	1
Title: The active conformation of avilamycin A is conferred by AviX12, a radical AdoMet enzyme Abstract: The antibiotic avilamycin A is produced by Streptomyces viridochromogenes Tü57. Avilamycin belongs to the family of orthosomycins with a linear heptasaccharide chain linked to a terminal dichloroisoeverninic acid as aglycone. The gene cluster for avilamycin biosynthesis contains 54 open reading frames. Inactivation of one of these genes, namely aviX12, led to the formation of a novel avilamycin derivative named gavibamycin N1. The structure of the new metabolite was confirmed by mass spectrometry (MS) and NMR analysis. It harbors glucose as a component of the heptasaccharide chain instead of a mannose moiety in avilamycin A. Antibacterial activity tests against a spectrum of Gram-positive organisms showed that the new derivative possesses drastically decreased biological activity in comparison to avilamycin A. Thus, AviX12 seems to be implicated in converting avilamycin to its bioactive conformation by catalyzing an unusual epimerization reaction. Sequence comparisons grouped AviX12 in the radical S-adenosylmethionine protein family. AviX12 engineered with a His tag was overexpressed in Escherichia coli and purified by affinity chromatography. The iron sulfur cluster [Fe-S] present in radical AdoMet enzymes was detected in purified AviX12 by means of electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy.	1
Title: Insights into the synthesis of lipopolysaccharide and antibiotics through the structures of two retaining glycosyltransferases from family GT4 Abstract: Glycosyltransferases (GTs) catalyze the synthesis of the myriad glycoconjugates that are central to life. One of the largest families is GT4, which contains several enzymes of therapeutic significance, exemplified by WaaG and AviGT4. WaaG catalyses a key step in lipopolysaccharide synthesis, while AviGT4, produced by Streptomyces viridochromogenes, contributes to the synthesis of the antibiotic avilamycin A. Here we present the crystal structure of both WaaG and AviGT4. The two enzymes contain two "Rossmann-like" (beta/alpha/beta) domains characteristic of the GT-B fold. Both recognition of the donor substrate and the catalytic machinery is similar to other retaining GTs that display the GT-B fold. Structural information is discussed with respect to the evolution of GTs and the therapeutic significance of the two enzymes.	1
Title: Structure and function of the antibiotic resistance-mediating methyltransferase AviRb from Streptomyces viridochromogenes Abstract: The emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains is a widespread problem in medical practice and drug design, and each case requires the elucidation of the underlying mechanism. AviRb from Streptomyces viridochromogenes methylates the 2'-O atom of U2479 of the 23S ribosomal RNA in Gram-positive bacteria and thus mediates resistance to the oligosaccharide (orthosomycin) antibiotic avilamycin. The structure of AviRb with and without bound cofactor S-adenosyl-L-methionine (AdoMet) was determined, showing that it is a homodimer belonging to the SpoU family within the SPOUT class of methyltransferases. The relationships within this class were analyzed in detail and, in addition, a novel fourth SpoU sequence fingerprint is proposed. Each subunit of AviRb consists of two domains. The N-terminal domain, being related to the ribosomal proteins L30 and L7Ae, is likely to bind RNA. The C-terminal domain is related to all SPOUT methyltransferases, and is responsible for AdoMet-binding, catalysis and dimerization. The cofactor binds at the characteristic knot of the polypeptide in an unusually bent conformation. The transferred methyl group points to a broad cleft formed with the L30-type domain of the other subunit. Measurements of mutant activity revealed four important residues responsible for catalysis and allowed the modeling of a complex between AviRb and the RNA target. The model includes a specificity pocket for uracil but does not contain a base for deprotonating the 2'-O atom of U2479 on methylation.	1
Title: The avilamycin resistance determinants AviRa and AviRb methylate 23S rRNA at the guanosine 2535 base and the uridine 2479 ribose Abstract: Avilamycin is an orthosomycin antibiotic that has shown considerable potential for clinical use, although it is presently used as a growth promoter in animal feed. Avilamycin inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by binding to the 50S ribosomal subunit. The ribosomes of the producer strain, Streptomyces viridochromogenes Tü57, are protected from the drug by the action of three resistance factors located in the avilamycin biosynthetic gene cluster. Two of the resistance factors, aviRa and aviRb, encode rRNA methyltransferases that specifically target 23S rRNA. Recombinant AviRa and AviRb proteins retain their activity after purification, and both specifically methylate in vitro transcripts of 23S rRNA domain V. Reverse transcriptase primer extension indicated that AviRa is an N-methyltransferase that targets G2535 within helix 91 of the rRNA, whereas AviRb modified the 2'-O-ribose position of nucleotide U2479 within helix 89. MALDI mass spectrometry confirmed the exact positions of each of these modifications, and additionally established that a single methyl group is added at each nucleotide. Neither of these two nucleotides have previously been described as a target for enzymatic methylation. Molecular models of the 50S subunit crystal structure show that the N-1 of the G2535 base and the 2'-hydroxyl of U2479 are separated by approximately 10 A, a distance that can be spanned by avilamycin. In addition to defining new resistance mechanisms, these data refine our understanding of the probable ribosome contacts made by orthosomycins and of how these antibiotics inhibit protein synthesis.	1
Title: Evernimicin binds exclusively to the 50S ribosomal subunit and inhibits translation in cell-free systems derived from both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria Abstract: Evernimicin (SCH 27899) is a new antibiotic with activity against a wide spectrum of gram-positive bacteria and activity against some gram-negative bacteria. Previous metabolic labeling studies indicated that evernimicin specifically inhibited protein synthesis in Staphylococcus aureus. Using a susceptible Escherichia coli strain, we demonstrated that evernimicin also inhibited protein synthesis in E. coli. In cell-free translation assays with extracts from either E. coli or S. aureus, evernimicin had a 50% inhibitory concentration of approximately 125 nM. In contrast, cell-free systems derived from wheat germ and rabbit reticulocytes were inhibited only by very high levels of evernimicin. Evernimicin did not promote transcript misreading. [(14)C]evernimicin specifically bound to the 50S subunit from E. coli. Nonlinear regression analysis of binding data generated with 70S ribosomes from E. coli and S. aureus and 50S subunits from E. coli returned dissociation constants of 84, 86, and 160 nM, respectively. In binding experiments, performed in the presence of excess quantities of a selection of antibiotics known to bind to the 50S subunit, only the structurally similar drug avilamycin blocked binding of [(14)C]evernimicin to ribosomes.	1
Title: Genetic localization and in vivo characterization of a Monascus azaphilone pigment biosynthetic gene cluster Abstract: Monascus spp. produce several well-known polyketides such as monacolin K, citrinin, and azaphilone pigments. In this study, the azaphilone pigment biosynthetic gene cluster was identified through T-DNA random mutagenesis in Monascus purpureus. The albino mutant W13 bears a T-DNA insertion upstream of a transcriptional regulator gene (mppR1). The transcription of mppR1 and the nearby polyketide synthase gene (MpPKS5) was significantly repressed in the W13 mutant. Targeted inactivation of MpPKS5 also gave rise to an albino mutant, confirming that mppR1 and MpPKS5 belong to an azaphilone pigment biosynthetic gene cluster. This M. purpureus sequence was used to identify the whole biosynthetic gene cluster in the Monascus pilosus genome. MpPKS5 contains SAT/KS/AT/PT/ACP/MT/R domains, and this domain organization is preserved in other azaphilone polyketide synthases. This biosynthetic gene cluster also encodes fatty acid synthase (FAS), which is predicted to assist the synthesis of 3-oxooactanoyl-CoA and 3-oxodecanoyl-CoA. These 3-oxoacyl compounds are proposed to be incorporated into the azaphilone backbone to complete the pigment biosynthesis. A monooxygenase gene (an azaH and tropB homolog) that is located far downstream of the FAS gene is proposed to be involved in pyrone ring formation. A homology search on other fungal genome sequences suggests that this azaphilone pigment gene cluster also exists in the Penicillium marneffei and Talaromyces stipitatus genomes.	1
Title: Characterization of the bafilomycin biosynthetic gene cluster from Streptomyces lohii Abstract: New hope for old bones: The plecomacrolide bafilomycin has been explored for decades as an anti-osteoporotic. However, its structural complexity has limited the synthesis of analogues. The cloning of the bafilomycin biosynthetic gene cluster from the environmental isolate Streptomyces lohii opens the door to the production of new analogues through bioengineering.	1
Title: Biosynthesis of macrolactam BE-14106 involves two distinct PKS systems and amino acid processing enzymes for generation of the aminoacyl starter unit Abstract: BE-14106 is a macrocyclic lactam with an acyl side chain previously identified in a marine-derived Streptomyces sp. The gene cluster for BE-14106 biosynthesis was cloned from a Streptomyces strain newly isolated from marine sediments collected in the Trondheimsfjord (Norway). Bioinformatics and experimental analyses of the genes in the cluster suggested an unusual mechanism for assembly of the molecule. Biosynthesis of the aminoacyl starter apparently involves the concerted action of a distinct polyketide synthase (PKS) system and several enzymes that activate and process an amino acid. The resulting starter unit is loaded onto a second PKS complex, which completes the synthesis of the macrolactam ring. Gene inactivation experiments, enzyme assays with heterologously expressed proteins, and feeding studies supported the proposed model for the biosynthesis and provided new insights into the assembly of macrolactams with acyl side chain.	1
Title: Biosynthesis of the angiogenesis inhibitor borrelidin by Streptomyces parvulus Tü4055: cluster analysis and assignment of functions Abstract: The biosynthetic gene cluster for the angiogenesis inhibitor borrelidin has been cloned from Streptomyces parvulus Tü4055. Sequence analysis indicates that the macrolide ring of borrelidin is formed by a modular polyketide synthase (PKS) (borA1-A6), a result that was confirmed by disruption of borA3. The borrelidin PKS is striking because only seven rather than the nine modules expected for a nonaketide product are encoded by borA1-A6. The starter unit of the PKS has been verified as trans-cyclopentane-1,2-dicarboxylic acid (trans-1,2-CPDA), and the genes involved in its biosynthesis identified. Other genes responsible for biosynthesis of the nitrile moiety, regulation, and self-resistance were also identified.	1
Title: Evidence from engineered gene fusions for the repeated use of a module in a modular polyketide synthase Abstract: Functional evidence for programmed loss of co-linearity on the borrelidin modular polyketide synthase (PKS) is presented.	1
Title: Biosynthesis of the angiogenesis inhibitor borrelidin by Streptomyces parvulus Tü4055: insights into nitrile formation Abstract: The 18-membered polyketide macrolide borrelidin exhibits a number of important biological activities, including potent angiogenesis inhibition. This has prompted two recent total syntheses as well as the cloning of the biosynthetic gene cluster from Streptomyces parvulus Tü4055. Borrelidin possesses some unusual structural characteristics, including a cyclopentane carboxylic acid moiety at C17 and a nitrile moiety at C12 of the macrocyclic ring. Nitrile groups are relatively rare in nature, and little is known of their biosynthesis during secondary metabolism. The nitrile group of borrelidin is shown here to arise from the methyl group of a methylmalonyl-CoA extender unit incorporated during polyketide chain extension. Insertional inactivation of two genes in the borrelidin gene cluster, borI (coding for a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase) and borJ (coding for an aminotransferase), generated borrelidin non-producing mutants. These mutants accumulated different compounds lacking the C12 nitrile moiety, with the product of the borI-minus mutant (12-desnitrile-12-methyl-borrelidin) possessing a methyl group and that of the borJ-minus mutant (12-desnitrile-12-carboxyl-borrelidin) a carboxyl group at C12. The former but not the latter was converted into borrelidin when biotransformed by an S. parvulus mutant that is deficient in the biosynthesis of the borrelidin starter unit. This suggests that 12-desnitrile-12-methyl-borrelidin is a competent biosynthetic intermediate, whereas the carboxylated derivative is a shunt metabolite. Bioconversion of 12-desnitrile-12-methyl-borrelidin into borrelidin was also achieved in a heterologous system co-expressing borI and borJ in Streptomyces albus J1074. This bioconversion was more efficient when borK, which is believed to encode a dehydrogenase, was simultaneously expressed with borI and borJ. On the basis of these findings, a pathway is proposed for the formation of the nitrile moiety during borrelidin biosynthesis.	1
Title: Characterization of the biosynthesis gene cluster for the pyrrole polyether antibiotic calcimycin (A23187) in Streptomyces chartreusis NRRL 3882 Abstract: The pyrrole polyether antibiotic calcimycin (A23187) is a rare ionophore that is specific for divalent cations. It is widely used as a biochemical and pharmacological tool because of its multiple, unique biological effects. Here we report on the cloning, sequencing, and mutational analysis of the 64-kb biosynthetic gene cluster from Streptomyces chartreusis NRRL 3882. Gene replacements confirmed the identity of the gene cluster, and in silico analysis of the DNA sequence revealed 27 potential genes, including 3 genes for the biosynthesis of the α-ketopyrrole moiety, 5 genes that encode modular type I polyketide synthases for the biosynthesis of the spiroketal ring, 4 genes for the biosynthesis of 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid, an N-methyltransferase tailoring gene, a resistance gene, a type II thioesterase gene, 3 regulatory genes, 4 genes with other functions, and 5 genes of unknown function. We propose a pathway for the biosynthesis of calcimycin and assign the genes to the biosynthesis steps. Our findings set the stage for producing much desired calcimycin derivatives using genetic modification instead of chemical synthesis.	1
Title: The calicheamicin gene cluster and its iterative type I enediyne PKS Abstract: The enediynes exemplify nature's ingenuity. We have cloned and characterized the biosynthetic locus coding for perhaps the most notorious member of the nonchromoprotein enediyne family, calicheamicin. This gene cluster contains an unusual polyketide synthase (PKS) that is demonstrated to be essential for enediyne biosynthesis. Comparison of the calicheamicin locus with the locus encoding the chromoprotein enediyne C-1027 reveals that the enediyne PKS is highly conserved among these distinct enediyne families. Contrary to previous hypotheses, this suggests that the chromoprotein and nonchromoprotein enediynes are generated by similar biosynthetic pathways.	1
Title: Organizational and mutational analysis of a complete FR-008/candicidin gene cluster encoding a structurally related polyene complex Abstract: The complete gene cluster for biosynthesis of a polyene complex, FR-008, spans 137.2 kb of the genome of Streptomyces sp. FR-008 consisting of six genes for a modular PKS and 15 additional genes. The extensive similarity to the partially characterized candicidin gene cluster in Streptomyces griseus IMRU3570, especially for genes involved in mycosamine biosynthesis, prompted us to compare the compounds produced by Streptomyces sp. FR-008 and Streptomyces griseus IMRU3570, and we found that FR-008 and candicidin complex are identical. A model for biosynthesis of a set of four structurally related FR-008/candicidin compounds was proposed. Deletion of the putative regulatory genes abolished antibiotic production, while disruption of putative glycosyltransferase and GDP-ketosugar aminotransferase functionalities led to the productions of a set of nonmycosaminated aglycones and a novel polyene complex with attachment of altered sugar moiety, respectively.	1
Title: Chalcomycin biosynthesis gene cluster from Streptomyces bikiniensis: novel features of an unusual ketolide produced through expression of the chm polyketide synthase in Streptomyces fradiae Abstract: Chalcomycin, a 16-membered macrolide antibiotic made by the bacterium Streptomyces bikiniensis, contains a 2,3-trans double bond and the neutral sugar D-chalcose in place of the amino sugar mycaminose found in most other 16-membered macrolides. Degenerate polyketide synthase (PKS)-specific primers were used to amplify DNA fragments from S. bikiniensis with very high identity to a unique ketosynthase domain of the tylosin PKS. The resulting amplimers were used to identify two overlapping cosmids encompassing the chm PKS. Sequencing revealed a contiguous segment of >60 kb carrying 25 putative genes for biosynthesis of the polyketide backbone, the two deoxysugars, and enzymes involved in modification of precursors of chalcomycin or resistance to it. The chm PKS lacks the ketoreductase and dehydratase domains in the seventh module expected to produce the 2,3-double bond in chalcomycin. Expression of PKS in the heterologous host Streptomyces fradiae, from which the tyl genes encoding the PKS had been removed, resulted in production of at least one novel compound, characterized as a 3-keto 16-membered macrolactone in equilibrium with its 3-trans enol tautomer and containing the sugar mycaminose at the C-5 position, in agreement with the structure predicted on the basis of the domain organization of the chm PKS. The production of a 3-keto macrolide from the chm PKS indicates that a discrete set of enzymes is responsible for the introduction of the 2,3-trans double bond in chalcomycin. From comparisons of the open reading frames to sequences in databases, a pathway for the synthesis of nucleoside diphosphate-D-chalcose was proposed.	1
Title: Genetic characterization of the chlorothricin gene cluster as a model for spirotetronate antibiotic biosynthesis Abstract: The biosynthetic gene cluster for chlorothricin (CHL) was localized to a 122 kb contiguous DNA from Streptomyces antibioticus DSM 40725, and its involvement in CHL biosynthesis was confirmed by gene inactivation and complementation. Bioinformatic analysis of the sequenced 111.989 kb DNA region revealed 42 open reading frames, 35 of which were defined to constitute the CHL gene cluster. An assembly model for CHL biosynthesis from D-olivose, 2-methoxy-5-chloro-6-methylsalicyclic acid, and chlorothricolide building blocks was proposed. This work represents cloning of a gene cluster for spirotetronate antibiotic biosynthesis and sets the stage to investigate the unusual macrolide biosynthesis including tandem Diels-Alder cyclizations, Baeyer-Villiger oxidation, and incorporation of an enoylpyruvate unit.	1
Title: Cloning and characterization of a bacterial iterative type I polyketide synthase gene encoding the 6-methylsalicyclic acid synthase Abstract: Unusual polyketide synthases (PKSs), that are structurally type I but act in an iterative manner for aromatic polyketide biosynthesis, are a new family found in bacteria. Here we report the cloning of the iterative type I PKS gene chlB1 from the chlorothricin (CHL) producer Streptomyces antibioticus DSM 40725 by a rapid PCR approach, and characterization of the function of the gene product as a 6-methylsalicyclic acid synthase (6-MSAS). Sequence analysis of various iterative type I PKSs suggests that the resulting aromatic or aliphatic structure of the products might be intrinsically determined by a catalytic feature of the paired KR-DH domains in the control of the double bond geometry. The finding of ChlB1 as a 6-MSAS not only enriches the current knowledge of aromatic polyketide biosynthesis in bacteria, but will also contribute to the generation of novel polyketide analogs via combinatorial biosynthesis with engineered PKSs.	1
Title: Insights into bacterial 6-methylsalicylic acid synthase and its engineering to orsellinic acid synthase for spirotetronate generation Abstract: The enzymes 6-methylsalicylic acid (6-MSA) synthases (6-MSASs) are involved in the building of an aryl moiety in many bioactive secondary metabolites produced by fungi and bacteria. Using the bacterial 6-MSAS ChlB1 in the biosynthesis of spirotetronate antibiotic chlorothricin (CHL) as a model, functional analysis of its dehydratase (DH) and ketoreductase (KR) domains by site-specific mutagenesis revealed that selective ketoreduction is not essential for polyketide chain extension. Promiscuity of the ketoacylsynthase domain in beta functionality recognition allows for engineering ChlB1 to an orsellinic acid (OSA) synthase (OSAS) by inactivating KR at the active site. The engineered ChlB1 is compatible with the enzymes for late-stage tailoring in CHL biosynthesis, featuring specific protein recognitions that facilitate variable aryl group incorporation. The resulting spirotetronates, which bear an OSA-derived aryl group, exhibited antibacterial activities comparable to those of the parent products.	1
Title: Identification and molecular genetic analysis of the cichorine gene cluster in Aspergillus nidulans Abstract: We recently demonstrated that the phytotoxin cichorine is produced by Aspergillus nidulans. Through a set of targeted deletions, we have found a cluster of seven genes that are required for its biosynthesis. Two of the deletions yielded molecules that give information about the biosynthesis of this metabolite.	1
Title: A cryptic type I polyketide synthase (cpk) gene cluster in Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) Abstract: The chromosome of Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2), a model organism for the genus Streptomyces, contains a cryptic type I polyketide synthase (PKS) gene cluster which was revealed when the genome was sequenced. The ca. 54-kb cluster contains three large genes, cpkA, cpkB and cpkC, encoding the PKS subunits. In silico analysis showed that the synthase consists of a loading module, five extension modules and a unique reductase as a terminal domain instead of a typical thioesterase. All acyltransferase domains are specific for a malonyl extender, and have a B-type ketoreductase. Tailoring and regulatory genes were also identified within the gene cluster. Surprisingly, some genes show high similarity to primary metabolite genes not commonly identified in any antibiotic biosynthesis cluster. Using western blot analysis with a PKS subunit (CpkC) antibody, CpkC was shown to be expressed in S. coelicolor at transition phase. Disruption of cpkC gave no obvious phenotype.	1
Title: Deletion of a regulatory gene within the cpk gene cluster reveals novel antibacterial activity in Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) Abstract: Genome sequencing of Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) revealed an uncharacterized type I polyketide synthase gene cluster (cpk). Here we describe the discovery of a novel antibacterial activity (abCPK) and a yellow-pigmented secondary metabolite (yCPK) after deleting a presumed pathway-specific regulatory gene (scbR2) that encodes a member of the gamma-butyrolactone receptor family of proteins and which lies in the cpk gene cluster. Overproduction of yCPK and abCPK in a scbR2 deletion mutant, and the absence of the newly described compounds from cpk deletion mutants, suggest that they are products of the previously orphan cpk biosynthetic pathway in which abCPK is converted into the yellow pigment. Transcriptional analysis suggests that scbR2 may act in a negative feedback mechanism to eventually limit yCPK biosynthesis. The results described here represent a novel approach for the discovery of new, biologically active compounds.	1
Title: Type II thioesterase ScoT is required for coelimycin production by the modular polyketide synthase Cpk of Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) Abstract: Type II thioesterases were shown to maintain efficiency of modular type I polyketide synthases and nonribosomal peptide synthetases by removing acyl residues blocking extension modules. We found that thioesterase ScoT from Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) is required for the production of the yellow-pigmented coelimycin by the modular polyketide synthase Cpk. No production of coelimycin was observed in cultures of scoT disruption mutant. Polyketide production was restored upon complementation with an intact copy of the scoT gene. An enzymatic assay showed that ScoT thioesterase can hydrolyse a 12-carbon acyl chain but the activity is too low to play a role in product release from the polyketide synthase. We conclude that ScoT is an editing enzyme necessary to maintain the activity of polyketide synthase Cpk. We provide a HPLC based method to measure the amount of coelimycin P2 in a culture medium.	1
Title: Molecular cloning and characterization of an ML-236B (compactin) biosynthetic gene cluster in Penicillium citrinum Abstract: Cloning of genes encoding polyketide synthases (PKSs) has allowed us to identify a gene cluster for ML-236B biosynthesis in Penicillium citrinum. Like lovastatin, which is produced by Aspergillus terreus, ML-236B (compactin) inhibits the enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase. Genomic sequencing and Northern analysis showed that nine predicted genes for ML-236B biosynthesis were located within a 38-kb region and were transcribed when ML-236B was produced. The predicted amino acid sequences encoded by these nine genes, designated mlcA- mlcH and mlcR, were similar to those encoded by the genes for lovastatin synthesis, and were therefore assumed to be involved either directly or indirectly in ML-236B biosynthesis. Targeted disruption experiments provided evidence that two PKS genes in the cluster, mlcA and mlcB, are required for the biosynthesis of the nonaketide and the diketide moieties, respectively, of ML-236B, suggesting that the gene cluster as a whole is responsible for ML-236B biosynthesis in P. citrinum. Bioconversion of some of the predicted intermediates by an mlcA-disrupted mutant was also investigated in order to analyze the ML-236B biosynthetic pathway. The molecular organization of the gene cluster and proposed functions for the ML-236B biosynthetic genes in P. citrinum are described.	1
Title: Effect of increased dosage of the ML-236B (compactin) biosynthetic gene cluster on ML-236B production in Penicillium citrinum Abstract: The gene cluster responsible for ML-236B (compactin) biosynthesis has recently been characterized from P. citrinum No. 41520. Here, we describe how the ML-236B-producing strain was improved using a cosmid-mediated recombination technique. The introduction of the cosmid pML48, which contains seven of the nine ML-236B biosynthetic genes, into P. citrinum No. 41520 resulted in transformants which produced increased amounts of ML-236B. Southern analysis showed that pML48 had been incorporated by a homologous recombination event, and all high producers possessed two copies of each of the seven genes, mlcA- mlcF and mlcR, suggesting that increased dosage of the biosynthetic gene cluster was responsible for the enhanced production of ML-236B. On the other hand, various kinds of mutants with decreased titers of ML-236B were also obtained. Characterization of one such mutant, designated as T48.28, which was more sensitive to ML-236B than the parental strain, suggested that one of the ML-236B biosynthetic genes, mlcD, which encodes a putative HMG-CoA reductase, was involved in conferring resistance to ML-236B.	1
Title: Identification of the specific sequence recognized by Penicillium citrinum MlcR, a GAL4-type transcriptional activator of ML-236B (compactin) biosynthetic genes Abstract: MlcR is a pathway-specific transcriptional activator of the ML-236B biosynthetic genes in Penicillium citrinum. The MlcR-binding sequences were identified by an in vitro gel-shift assay and an in vivo reporter assay for the region between mlcA and mlcC as a model. The gel-shift assay showed that recombinant MlcR bound to the DNA sequence 5'-ACGGCGTTATTCGG-3' and most of the bases in this motif were required for the interaction between MlcR and DNA. In the reporter assay using beta-glucuronidase (GUS), substitution of the bases in this binding sequence resulted in the drastic reduction of GUS activities. These data clearly indicate that this MlcR-binding sequence is essential for the transcriptional activation of mlcA and mlcC in P. citrinum. Similar motifs were found in other loci of the ML-236B biosynthetic gene cluster and the consensus-binding motif for MlcR was predicted to be a direct repeat, 5'-WCGG-N(6)-TCGG-3'.	1
Title: Functional analysis of mlcR, a regulatory gene for ML-236B (compactin) biosynthesis in Penicillium citrinum Abstract: The mlcR gene encodes a putative 50.2-kDa protein with a Zn(II)(2)Cys(6) DNA-binding domain, which may be involved in the regulation of ML-236B biosynthesis in Penicillium citrinum. The induction of ML-236B production appears to correlate with the expression of mlcR, and the ML-236B biosynthetic genes mlcA- mlcH, and occurs mostly during the stationary phase. The present study was designed to examine the effects of alterations in mlcR expression on ML-236B biosynthesis. We first set out to increase the mlcR copy number in the chromosome of P. citrinum. Transformants with additional copies of native mlcR showed increased transcription of mlcR and produced larger amounts of ML-236B than the parent strain. Altered mlcR expression was also achieved by introducing a construct, designated pgkA(P)::mlcR, that contained the mlcR coding region fused to the (constitutively active) promoter and terminator sequences of the Aspergillus nidulans 3-phospho-glycerate kinase (pgkA) gene. Transformants carrying the pgkA(P)::mlcR construct expressed mlcR constitutively, and produced ML-236B during the exponential growth phase, suggesting that the pgkA(P)::mlcR construct does affect the regulation of ML-236B biosynthesis. Comparative expression analysis by RT-PCR showed that altering the expression profile of mlcR influenced the expression of some of the ML-236B biosynthetic genes. The evidence suggests that mlcR may indeed be involved in the transcriptional activation of some of the pathway-specific genes required for ML-236B biosynthesis.	1
Title: Organization of the biosynthetic gene cluster for the macrolide concanamycin A in Streptomyces neyagawaensis ATCC 27449 Abstract: The macrolide antibiotic concanamycin A has been identified as an exceptionally potent inhibitor of the vacuolar (V-type) ATPase. Such compounds have been mooted as the basis of a potential drug treatment for osteoporosis, since the V-ATPase is involved in the osteoclast-mediated bone resorption that underlies this common condition. To enable combinatorial engineering of altered concanamycins, the biosynthetic gene cluster governing the biosynthesis of concanamycin A has been cloned from Streptomyces neyagawaensis and shown to span a region of over 100 kbp of contiguous DNA. An efficient transformation system has been developed for S. neyagawaensis and used to demonstrate the role of the cloned locus in the formation of concanamycin A. Sequence analysis of the 28 ORFs in the region has revealed key features of the biosynthetic pathway, in particular the biosynthetic origin of portions of the backbone, which arise from the unusual polyketide building blocks ethylmalonyl-CoA and methoxymalonyl-ACP, and the origin of the pendant deoxysugar moiety 4'-O-carbamoyl-2'-deoxyrhamnose, as well as the presence of a modular polyketide synthase (PKS) encoded by six giant ORFs. Examination of the methoxymalonyl-specific acyltransferase (AT) domains has led to recognition of an amino acid sequence motif which can be used to distinguish methylmalonyl-CoA- from methoxymalonyl-ACP-specific AT domains in natural PKSs.	1
Title: A unique amino transfer mechanism for constructing the β-amino fatty acid starter unit in the biosynthesis of the macrolactam antibiotic cremimycin Abstract: Cremimycin is a 19-membered macrolactam glycoside antibiotic based on three distinctive substructures: 1) a β-amino fatty acid starter moiety, 2) a bicyclic macrolactam ring, and 3) a cymarose unit. To elucidate the biosynthetic machineries responsible for these three structures, the cremimycin biosynthetic gene cluster was identified. The cmi gene cluster consists of 33 open reading frames encoding eight polyketide synthases, six deoxysugar biosynthetic enzymes, and a characteristic group of five β-amino-acid-transfer enzymes. Involvement of the gene cluster in cremimycin production was confirmed by a gene knockout experiment. Further, a feeding experiment demonstrated that 3-aminononanoate is a direct precursor of cremimycin. Two characteristic enzymes of the cremimycin-type biosynthesis were functionally characterized in vitro. The results showed that a putative thioesterase homologue, CmiS1, catalyzes the Michael addition of glycine to the β-position of a non-2-enoic acid thioester, followed by hydrolysis of the thioester to give N-carboxymethyl-3-aminononanoate. Subsequently, the resultant amino acid was oxidized by a putative FAD-dependent glycine oxidase homologue, CmiS2, to produce 3-aminononanoate and glyoxylate. This represents a unique amino transfer mechanism for β-amino acid biosynthesis.	1
Title: Polyketide decarboxylative chain termination preceded by o-sulfonation in curacin a biosynthesis Abstract: Biosynthetic innovation in natural product systems is driven by the recruitment of new genes and enzymes into these complex pathways. Here, an unprecedented decarboxylative chain termination mechanism is described for the polyketide synthase of curacin A, an anticancer lead compound isolated from the marine cyanobacterium Lyngbya majuscula. The unusual chain termination module containing adjacent sulfotransferase (ST) and thioesterase (TE) catalytic domains embedded in CurM was biochemically characterized. The TE was proved to catalyze a hydrolytic chain release of the polyketide chain elongation intermediate. Moreover, a selective ST-mediated sulfonation of the (R)-beta-hydroxyl group was found to precede TE-mediated hydrolysis, triggering a successive decarboxylative elimination and resulting in the formation of a rare terminal olefin in the final metabolite.	1
Title: A highly unusual polyketide synthase directs dawenol polyene biosynthesis in Stigmatella aurantiaca Abstract: Enormous progress in the field of polyketide biosynthesis has led to the establishment of rules for general text book biosynthetic logic and consequently to the assumption that biosynthetic genes can be easily correlated with the corresponding natural products. However, non-textbook examples of polyketide assembly continue to be discovered suggesting the gene to product and product to gene predictions need improvement, especially as they are increasingly used in the post-genomic era. Here, we analyzed the genomic blueprint of a myxobacterial multi-producer of secondary metabolites, Stigmatella aurantiaca DW4/3-1, for its biosynthetic potential by genome-mining. In addition to the five polyketide synthase and/or nonribosomal peptide synthetase gene clusters of known function we identified a further 13 genomic regions exemplifying the enormous genetic potential for the production of additional chemical diversity by this strain. We show by gene inactivation and heterologous expression of the newly identified biosynthetic pathway for dawenol that the biosynthesis of this known polyene does not follow text book biosynthetic logic. Intriguingly, a genomic locus encoding an unusual polyketide synthase exhibiting similarity to gene loci involved in the formation of polyunsaturated fatty acids and secondary lipids was identified.	1
Title: Characterization of the biosynthetic genes for 10,11-dehydrocurvularin, a heat shock response-modulating anticancer fungal polyketide from Aspergillus terreus Abstract: 10,11-Dehydrocurvularin is a prevalent fungal phytotoxin with heat shock response and immune-modulatory activities. It features a dihydroxyphenylacetic acid lactone polyketide framework with structural similarities to resorcylic acid lactones like radicicol or zearalenone. A genomic locus was identified from the dehydrocurvularin producer strain Aspergillus terreus AH-02-30-F7 to reveal genes encoding a pair of iterative polyketide synthases (A. terreus CURS1 [AtCURS1] and AtCURS2) that are predicted to collaborate in the biosynthesis of 10,11-dehydrocurvularin. Additional genes in this locus encode putative proteins that may be involved in the export of the compound from the cell and in the transcriptional regulation of the cluster. 10,11-Dehydrocurvularin biosynthesis was reconstituted in Saccharomyces cerevisiae by heterologous expression of the polyketide synthases. Bioinformatic analysis of the highly reducing polyketide synthase AtCURS1 and the nonreducing polyketide synthase AtCURS2 highlights crucial biosynthetic programming differences compared to similar synthases involved in resorcylic acid lactone biosynthesis. These differences lead to the synthesis of a predicted tetraketide starter unit that forms part of the 12-membered lactone ring of dehydrocurvularin, as opposed to the penta- or hexaketide starters in the 14-membered rings of resorcylic acid lactones. Tetraketide N-acetylcysteamine thioester analogues of the starter unit were shown to support the biosynthesis of dehydrocurvularin and its analogues, with yeast expressing AtCURS2 alone. Differential programming of the product template domain of the nonreducing polyketide synthase AtCURS2 results in an aldol condensation with a different regiospecificity than that of resorcylic acid lactones, yielding the dihydroxyphenylacetic acid scaffold characterized by an S-type cyclization pattern atypical for fungal polyketides.	1
Title: Biosynthesis and role in virulence of the histone deacetylase inhibitor depudecin from Alternaria brassicicola Abstract: Depudecin, an eleven-carbon linear polyketide made by the pathogenic fungus Alternaria brassicicola, is an inhibitor of histone deacetylase (HDAC). A chemically unrelated HDAC inhibitor, HC toxin, was earlier shown to be a major virulence factor in the interaction between Cochliobolus carbonum and its host, maize. In order to test whether depudecin is also a virulence factor for A. brassicicola, we identified the genes for depudecin biosynthesis and created depudecin-minus mutants. The depudecin gene cluster contains six genes (DEP1 to DEP6), which are predicted to encode a polyketide synthase (AbPKS9 or DEP5), a transcription factor (DEP6), two monooxygenases (DEP2 and DEP4), a transporter of the major facilitator superfamily (DEP3), and one protein of unknown function (DEP1). The involvement in depudecin production of DEP2, DEP4, DEP5, and DEP6 was demonstrated by targeted gene disruption. DEP6 is required for expression of DEP1 through DEP5 but not the immediate flanking genes, thus defining a coregulated depudecin biosynthetic cluster. The genes flanking the depudecin gene cluster but not the cluster itself are conserved in the same order in the related fungi Stagonospora nodorum and Pyrenophora tritici-repentis. Depudecin-minus mutants have a small (10%) but statistically significant reduction in virulence on cabbage (Brassica oleracea) but not on Arabidopsis. The role of depudecin in virulence is, therefore, less dramatic than that of HC toxin.	1
Title: Biosynthesis of dTDP-6-deoxy-beta-D-allose, biochemical characterization of dTDP-4-keto-6-deoxyglucose reductase (GerKI) from Streptomyces sp. KCTC 0041BP Abstract: dTDP-6-deoxy-d-allose, an unusual deoxysugar, has been identified as an intermediate in the mycinose biosynthetic pathway of several macrolide antibiotics. In order to characterize the biosynthesis of this deoxysugar, we have cloned and heterologously overexpressed gerK1 in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) cells. This gene encodes for a protein with the putative function of a dTDP-4-keto-6-deoxyglucose reductase, which appears to be involved in the dihydrochalcomycin (GERI-155) biosynthesis evidenced by Streptomyces sp KCTC 0041BP. Our results revealed that GerK1 exhibited a specific reductive effect on the 4-keto carbon of dTDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-d-allose, with the hydroxyl group in an axial configuration at the C3 position only. The enzyme catalyzed the conversion of dTDP-4-keto-6-deoxyglucose to dTDP-6-deoxy-beta-D-allose, according to the results of an in vitro coupled enzyme assay, in the presence of GerF (dTDP-4-keto-6-deoxyglucose 3-epimerase). The product was isolated, and its stereochemistry was determined via nuclear magnetic resonance analysis.	1
Title: A polyketide synthase gene required for biosynthesis of the aflatoxin-like toxin, dothistromin Abstract: Dothistromin is a polyketide toxin, produced by a fungal forest pathogen, with structural similarity to the aflatoxin precursor versicolorin B. Biochemical and genetic studies suggested that there are common steps in the biosynthetic pathways for these metabolites and showed similarities between some of the genes. A polyketide synthase gene (pksA) was isolated from dothistromin-producing Dothistroma septosporum by hybridization with an aflatoxin ortholog from Aspergillus parasiticus. Inactivation of this gene in D. septosporum resulted in mutants that could not produce dothistromin but that could convert exogenous aflatoxin precursors, including norsolorinic acid, into dothistromin. The mutants also had reduced asexual sporulation compared to the wild type. So far four other genes are known to be clustered immediately alongside pksA. Three of these (cypA, moxA, avfA) are predicted to be orthologs of aflatoxin biosynthetic genes. The other gene (epoA), located between avfA and moxA, is predicted to encode an epoxide hydrolase, for which there is no homolog in either the aflatoxin or sterigmatocystin gene clusters. The pksA gene is located on a small chromosome of approximately 1.3 Mb in size, along with the dothistromin ketoreductase (dotA) gene.	1
Title: Isolation and identification of three new 5-alkenyl-3,3(2H)-furanones from two streptomyces species using a genomic screening approach Abstract: Analyses of biosynthetic gene clusters derived from Streptomyces aculeolatus NRRL 18422 and Streptomyces sp. Eco86 indicated that both microorganisms have similar type I polyketide synthase (PKS) gene clusters with relatively few genes encoding post-PKS elaborative enzymes. However both gene clusters included a sequence coding for a relatively uncommon oxidative enzyme related to Baeyer-Villiger, flavin-type monooxygenases. Screening of culture extracts for compounds with the predicted physicochemical properties of the end products from these loci, led to the isolation of three 5-alkenyl-3,3(2H)-furanones, one (E-837, 1) from the former and two (E-492, 2, E-975, 3) from the latter strain. The structures, confirmed by spectral analyses including MS, and ID and 2D NMR experiments, were in accord with those predicted by genomic analyses. Baeyer-Villiger type oxidation is postulated to be involved in the formation of the furanone moieties in these molecules. All three new compounds were tested for their electron transport inhibitory activities. They had IC50 values of 1-4 microg/ml against Ascaris suum NADH-fumarate reductase and 1-12 microg/ml against bovine heart NADH oxidase.	1
Title: Biosynthesis of ebelactone A: isotopic tracer, advanced precursor and genetic studies reveal a thioesterase-independent cyclization to give a polyketide β-lactone Abstract: Macrocyclization of polyketides generates arrays of molecular architectures that are directly linked to biological activities. The four-membered ring in oxetanones (β-lactones) is found in a variety of bioactive polyketides (for example, lipstatin, hymeglusin and ebelactone), yet details of its molecular assembly have not been extensively elucidated. Using ebelactone as a model system, and its producer Streptomyces aburaviensis ATCC 31860, labeling with sodium [1-(13)C,(18)O2]propionate afforded ebelactone A that contains (18)O at all oxygen sites. The pattern of (13)C-(18)O bond retention defines the steps for ebelactone biosynthesis, and demonstrates that β-lactone ring formation occurs by attack of a β-hydroxy group onto the carbonyl moiety of an acyclic precursor. Reaction of ebelactone A with N-acetylcysteamine (NAC) gives the β-hydroxyacyl thioester, which cyclizes quantitatively to give ebelactone A in aqueous ethanol. The putative gene cluster encoding the polyketide synthase (PKS) for biosynthesis of 1 was also identified; notably the ebelactone PKS lacks a terminal thioesterase (TE) domain and no stand alone TE was found. Thus the formation of ebelactone is not TE dependent, supporting the hypothesis that cyclization occurs on the PKS surface in a process that is modeled by the chemical cyclization of the NAC thioester.	1
Title: Microbial genomics as a guide to drug discovery and structural elucidation: ECO-02301, a novel antifungal agent, as an example Abstract: Analysis of the genome of Streptomyces aizunensis NRRL B-11277 indicated its potential to produce a compound of novel and highly predictable structure. The structure was predicted with sufficient accuracy to allow straightforward detection of the specific metabolite in HPLC profiles of fermentation extracts and hence to guide the isolation. The spectroscopic work was reduced to a confirmation of structure rather than a first principle determination. The compound, ECO-02301 (1), demonstrated potent antifungal activity. This work exemplifies not only the discovery of novel antibiotics from well-characterized organisms but also the utility of genomics as a further tool, complementary to spectroscopy, to enable rapid determination of complex structures.	1
Title: The erythromycin biosynthetic gene cluster of Aeromicrobium erythreum Abstract: The erythromycin-biosynthetic (ery) gene cluster of Aeromicrobium erythreum was cloned and characterized. The 55.4-kb cluster contains 25 ery genes. Homologues were found for each gene in the previously characterized ery gene cluster from Saccharopolyspora erythraea. In addition, four new predicted ery genes were identified. Two of the new predicted genes, coding for a phosphopantetheinyl transferase (eryP) and a type II thioesterase (eryTII), were internal to the ery cluster. The other two new genes, coding for a thymidine 5'-diphosphate-glucose synthase (eryDI) and a MarR-family transcriptional repressor (ery-ORF25), were found at the two ends of the ery cluster. A knockout in eryDI showed it to be essential for erythromycin biosynthesis. The gene order of the two ery clusters was conserved within a core region of 15 contiguous genes, with the exception of IS1136 which was not found in the A. erythreum cluster. Beyond the core region, gene shuffling had occurred between the two sides of the cluster. The flanking regions of the two ery clusters were not alike in the type of genes found.	1
Title: Architectures of whole-module and bimodular proteins from the 6-deoxyerythronolide B synthase Abstract: The 6-deoxyerythronolide B synthase (DEBS) is a prototypical assembly line polyketide synthase produced by the actinomycete Saccharopolyspora erythraea that synthesizes the macrocyclic core of the antibiotic erythromycin 6-deoxyerythronolide B. The megasynthase is a 2-MDa trimeric complex composed of three unique homodimers assembled from the gene products DEBS1, DEBS2, and DEBS3, which are housed within the erythromycin biosynthetic gene cluster. Each homodimer contains two clusters of catalytically independent enzymatic domains, each referred to as a module, which catalyzes one round of polyketide chain extension and modification. Modules are named sequentially to indicate the order in which they are utilized during synthesis of 6-deoxyerythronolide B. We report small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) analyses of a whole module and a bimodule from DEBS, as well as a set of domains for which high-resolution structures are available. In all cases, the solution state was probed under previously established conditions ensuring that each protein is catalytically active. SAXS data are consistent with atomic-resolution structures of DEBS fragments. Therefore, we used the available high-resolution structures of DEBS domains to model the architectures of the larger protein assemblies using rigid-body refinement. Our data support a model in which the third module of DEBS forms a disc-shaped structure capable of caging the acyl carrier protein domain proximal to each active site. The molecular envelope of DEBS3 is a thin elongated ellipsoid, and the results of rigid-body modeling suggest that modules 5 and 6 stack collinearly along the 2-fold axis of symmetry.	1
Title: Systems perspectives on erythromycin biosynthesis by comparative genomic and transcriptomic analyses of S. erythraea E3 and NRRL23338 strains Abstract: Background:                       S. erythraea is a Gram-positive filamentous bacterium used for the industrial-scale production of erythromycin A which is of high clinical importance. In this work, we sequenced the whole genome of a high-producing strain (E3) obtained by random mutagenesis and screening from the wild-type strain NRRL23338, and examined time-series expression profiles of both E3 and NRRL23338. Based on the genomic data and transcriptpmic data of these two strains, we carried out comparative analysis of high-producing strain and wild-type strain at both the genomic level and the transcriptomic level.                  Results:                       We observed a large number of genetic variants including 60 insertions, 46 deletions and 584 single nucleotide variations (SNV) in E3 in comparison with NRRL23338, and the analysis of time series transcriptomic data indicated that the genes involved in erythromycin biosynthesis and feeder pathways were significantly up-regulated during the 60 hours time-course. According to our data, BldD, a previously identified ery cluster regulator, did not show any positive correlations with the expression of ery cluster, suggesting the existence of alternative regulation mechanisms of erythromycin synthesis in S. erythraea. Several potential regulators were then proposed by integration analysis of genomic and transcriptomic data.                  Conclusion:                       This is a demonstration of the functional comparative genomics between an industrial S. erythraea strain and the wild-type strain. These findings help to understand the global regulation mechanisms of erythromycin biosynthesis in S. erythraea, providing useful clues for genetic and metabolic engineering in the future.	1
Title: Knocking out of tailoring genes eryK and eryG in an industrial erythromycin-producing strain of Saccharopolyspora erythraea leading to overproduction of erythromycin B, C and D at different conversion ratios Abstract: Aims:                        To overproduce erythromycin C, B or D and evaluate the effect of disruption of tailoring genes eryK and eryG in an industrial erythromycin producer.                  Methods and results:                        The tailoring genes eryG and eryK were inactivated individually or simultaneously by targeted gene disruption in an industrial strain Saccharopolyspora erythraea HL3168 E3, resulting in the overproduction of erythromycin C (2·48 g l(-1) ), B (1·70 g l(-1) ) or D (2·15 g l(-1) ) in the mutant strain QL-G, QL-K or QL-KG, respectively. Analysis of the erythromycin congeners throughout the fermentation indicated that, at the end of fermentation, comparatively large amount of erythromycin D (0·67 g l(-1) ) was accumulated in QL-G, whereas only small amount of erythromycin D (0·10 g l(-1) ) was produced in QL-K.                  Conclusions:                       Inactivation of tailoring genes eryG and eryK in the high producer did not affect the biosynthesis of erythromycin. However, erythromycin D could be more efficiently methylated by EryG than be hydroxylated by EryK.                  Significance and impact of the study:                       Development of the mutant strains provides a method for the economical large-scale production of potent lead compounds. The information about the accumulation and conversion of erythromycins in the industrial strains may contribute to further improving erythromycin production.	1
Title: Knockout of the erythromycin biosynthetic cluster gene, eryBI, blocks isoflavone glucoside bioconversion during erythromycin fermentations in Aeromicrobium erythreum but not in Saccharopolyspora erythraea Abstract: Isoflavone glucosides are valuable nutraceutical compounds and are present in commercial fermentations, such as the erythromycin fermentation, as constituents of the soy flour in the growth medium. The purpose of this study was to develop a method for recovery of the isoflavone glucosides as value-added coproducts at the end of either Saccharopolyspora erythraea or Aeromicrobium erythreum fermentation. Because the first step in isoflavone metabolism was known to be the conversion of isoflavone glucosides to aglycones by a beta-glucosidase, we chose to knock out the only beta-glucosidase gene known at the start of the study, eryBI, to see what effect this had on metabolism of isoflavone glucosides in each organism. In the unicellular erythromycin producer A. erythreum, knockout of eryBI was sufficient to block the conversion of isoflavone glucosides to aglycones. In S. erythraea, knockout of eryBI had no effect on this reaction, suggesting that other beta-glucosidases are present. Erythromycin production was not significantly affected in either strain as a result of the eryBI knockout. This study showed that isoflavone metabolism could be blocked in A. erythreum by eryBI knockout but that eryBI knockout was not sufficient to block isoflavone metabolism in S. erythraea.	1
Title: Genetic modulation of the overexpression of tailoring genes eryK and eryG leading to the improvement of erythromycin A purity and production in Saccharopolyspora erythraea fermentation Abstract: Erythromycin A (Er-A) is the most potent and clinically important member in the Er family produced by Saccharopolyspora erythraea. Er-B and Er-C, which are biologically much less active and cause greater side effects than Er-A, serve as the intermediates for Er-A biosynthesis and impurities in fermentation processes of many industrial strains. In this study, systematical modulation of the amounts of tailoring enzymes EryK (a P450 hydroxylase) and EryG (an S-adenosylmethionine-dependent O-methyltransferase) was carried out by genetic engineering in S. erythraea, including alterations of gene copy number ratio and organization and integrating the locus on the chromosome by homologous recombination. Introduction of additional eryK and eryG genes into S. erythraea showed significant impacts on their transcription levels and enhanced the biotransformation process from Er-D to Er-A with gene dose effects. At the eryK/eryG copy number ratio of 3:2 as well as their resultant transcript ratio of around 2.5:1 to 3.0:1, Er-B and Er-C were nearly completely eliminated and accordingly converted to Er-A, and the Er titer was improved by around 25% in the recombinant strain ZL1004 (genotype PermK*-K-K-G + PermE*-K + PermA*-G) and ZL1007 (genotype PermK*-K-G-K + PermE*-K + PermA*-G). This study may contribute to the continuous efforts toward further evaluation of the Er-producing system, with the aims of improving Er-A purity and production at the fermentation stage and lowering the production costs and environmental concerns in industry.	1
Title: Complete genome sequence of the erythromycin-producing bacterium Saccharopolyspora erythraea NRRL23338 Abstract: Saccharopolyspora erythraea is used for the industrial-scale production of the antibiotic erythromycin A, derivatives of which play a vital role in medicine. The sequenced chromosome of this soil bacterium comprises 8,212,805 base pairs, predicted to encode 7,264 genes. It is circular, like those of the pathogenic actinomycetes Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Corynebacterium diphtheriae, but unlike the linear chromosomes of the model actinomycete Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) and the closely related Streptomyces avermitilis. The S. erythraea genome contains at least 25 gene clusters for production of known or predicted secondary metabolites, at least 72 genes predicted to confer resistance to a range of common antibiotic classes and many sets of duplicated genes to support its saprophytic lifestyle. The availability of the genome sequence of S. erythraea will improve insight into its biology and facilitate rational development of strains to generate high-titer producers of clinically important antibiotics.	1
Title: Effects of methylmalonyl-CoA mutase gene knockouts on erythromycin production in carbohydrate-based and oil-based fermentations of Saccharopolyspora erythraea Abstract: In carbohydrate-based fermentations of Saccharopolyspora erythraea, a polar knockout of the methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (MCM) gene, mutB, improved erythromycin production an average of 126% (within the range of 102-153% for a 0.95 confidence interval). In oil-based fermentations, where erythromycin production by the wild-type strain averages 184% higher (141-236%, 0.95 CI) than in carbohydrate-based fermentations, the same polar knockout in mutB surprisingly reduced erythromycin production by 66% (53-76%, 0.95 CI). A metabolic model is proposed where in carbohydrate-based fermentations MCM acts as a drain on the methylmalonyl-CoA metabolite pool, and in oil-based fermentations, MCM acts in the reverse direction to fill the methylmalonyl-CoA pool. Therefore, the model explains, in part, how the well-known oil-based process improvement for erythromycin production operates at the biochemical level; furthermore, it illustrates how the mutB erythromycin strain improvement mutation operates at the genetic level in carbohydrate-based fermentations.	1
Title: Improved bioconversion of 15-fluoro-6-deoxyerythronolide B to 15-fluoro-erythromycin A by overexpression of the eryK Gene in Saccharopolyspora erythraea Abstract: The bioconversion of a 6-deoxyerythronolide B analogue to the corresponding erythromycin A analogue (R-EryA) by a Saccharopolyspora erythraea mutant lacking the ketosynthase in the first polyketide synthase module was significantly improved by changing fluxes at a key branch point affecting the erythromycin congener distribution. This was achieved by integrating an additional copy of the eryK gene into the chromosome under control of the eryAIp promoter. Real-time PCR analysis of RNA confirmed higher expression of eryK in the resulting strain, S. erythraea K301-105B, compared to its parent. In shake flasks, K301-105B produced less of the shunt product 15-fluoro-erythromycin B (15F-EryB), suggesting a shift in congener distribution toward the desired product, 15-fluoro-erythromycin A (15F-EryA). In bioreactor studies, K301-105B produced 1.3 g/L of 15F-EryA with 75-80% molar yield on fed precursor, compared with 0.9 g/L 15F-EryA with 50-55% molar yield on fed precursor by the parent strain. At higher precursor feed rates, K301-105B produced 3.5 g/L of 15F-EryA while maintaining 75-80% molar yield on fed precursor.	1
Title: A specific role of the Saccharopolyspora erythraea thioesterase II gene in the function of modular polyketide synthases Abstract: Bacterial modular polyketide synthase (PKS) genes are commonly associated with another gene that encodes a thioesterase II (TEII) believed to remove aberrantly loaded substrates from the PKS. Co-expression of the Saccharopolyspora erythraea ery-ORF5 TEII and eryA genes encoding 6-deoxyerythronolide B synthase (DEBS) in Streptomyces hosts eliminated or significantly lowered production of 8,8'-deoxyoleandolide [15-nor-6-deoxyerythronolide B (15-nor-6dEB)], which arises from an acetate instead of a propionate starter unit. Disruption of the TEII gene in an industrial Sac. erythraea strain caused a notable amount of 15-norerythromycins to be produced by utilization of an acetate instead of a propionate starter unit and also resulted in moderately lowered production of erythromycin compared with the amount produced by the parental strain. A similar behaviour of the TEII gene was observed in Escherichia coli strains that produce 6dEB and 15-methyl-6dEB. Direct biochemical analysis showed that the ery-ORF5 TEII enzyme favours hydrolysis of acetyl groups bound to the loading acyl carrier protein domain (ACP(L)) of DEBS. These results point to a clear role of the TEII enzyme, i.e. removal of a specific type of acyl group from the ACP(L) domain of the DEBS1 loading module.	1
Title: Analysis of an 8.1-kb DNA fragment contiguous with the erythromycin gene cluster of Saccharopolyspora erythraea in the eryCI-flanking region Abstract: An 8.1-kb region of the Saccharopolyspora erythraea genome, significant for its contiguity to the known genes of the erythromycin biosynthetic gene cluster, was mutationally analyzed and its DNA sequence was determined. The region lies immediately adjacent to eryCI. The newly characterized region is notable for a large, 3.0-kb segment, predicted not to be translated, followed by four probable genes: an acetyltransferase gene, a protease inhibitor gene, a methyltransferase gene, and a transposase gene. Because the probable functions of the genes in this region are not required for erythromycin biosynthesis or resistance and because a deletion of a 6.0-kb portion of this region had no effect on erythromycin biosynthesis, this region marks the outside boundary of the erythromycin gene cluster. Therefore, eryCI represents the end of the cluster. These results complete the analysis of the erythromycin gene cluster and eliminate the possibility that additional sought-after pathway-specific structural or regulatory genes might be found within or adjacent to the cluster.	1
Title: Transcriptional organization of the erythromycin biosynthetic gene cluster of Saccharopolyspora erythraea Abstract: The transcriptional organization of the erythromycin biosynthetic gene (ery) cluster of Saccharopolyspora erythraea has been examined by a variety of methods, including S1 nuclease protection assays, Northern blotting, Western blotting, and bioconversion analysis of erythromycin intermediates. The analysis was facilitated by the construction of novel mutants containing a S. erythraea transcriptional terminator within the eryAI, eryAIII, eryBIII, eryBIV, eryBV, eryBVI, eryCIV, and eryCVI genes and additionally by an eryAI -10 promoter mutant. All mutant strains demonstrated polar effects on the transcription of downstream ery biosynthetic genes. Our results demonstrate that the ery gene cluster contains four major polycistronic transcriptional units, the largest one extending approximately 35 kb from eryAI to eryG. Two overlapping polycistronic transcripts extending from eryBIV to eryBVII were identified. In addition, seven ery cluster promoter transcription start sites, one each beginning at eryAI, eryBI, eryBIII, eryBVI, and eryK and two beginning at eryBIV, were determined.	1
Title: Analysis of eryBI, eryBIII and eryBVII from the erythromycin biosynthetic gene cluster in Saccharopolyspora erythraea Abstract: The gene cluster (ery) governing the biosynthesis of the macrolide antibiotic erythromycin A by Saccharopolyspora erythraea contains, in addition to the eryA genes encoding the polyketide synthase, two regions containing genes for later steps in the pathway. The region 5' of eryA that lies between the known genes ermE (encoding the erythromycin resistance methyltransferase) and eryBIII (encoding a putative S-adenosylmethionine-dependent methyltransferase), and that contains the gene eryBI (orf2), has now been sequenced. The inferred product of the eryBI gene shows striking sequence similarity to authentic beta-glucosidases. Specific mutants were created in eryBI, and the resulting strains were found to synthesise erythromycin A, showing that this gene, despite its position in the biosynthetic gene cluster, is not essential for erythromycin biosynthesis. A mutant in eryBIII and a double mutant in eryBI and eryBIII were obtained and the analysis of novel erythromycins produced by these strains confirmed the proposed function of EryBIII as a C-methyltransferase. Also, a chromosomal mutant was constructed for the previously sequenced ORF19 and shown to accumulate erythronolide B, as expected for an eryB mutant and consistent with its proposed role as an epimerase in dTDP-mycarose biosynthesis.	1
Title: Targeted gene inactivation for the elucidation of deoxysugar biosynthesis in the erythromycin producer Saccharopolyspora erythraea Abstract: The production of erythromycin A by Saccharopolyspora erythraea requires the synthesis of dTDP-D-desosamine and dTDP-L-mycarose, which serve as substrates for the transfer of the two sugar residues onto the macrolactone ring. The enzymatic activities involved in this process are largely encoded within the ery gene cluster, by two sets of genes flanking the eryA locus that encodes the polyketide synthase. We report here the nucleotide sequence of three such ORFs located immediately downstream of eryA, ORFs 7, 8 and 9. Chromosomal mutants carrying a deletion either in ORF7 or in one of the previously sequenced ORFs 13 and 14 have been constructed and shown to accumulate erythronolide B, as expected for eryB mutants. Similarly, chromosomal mutants carrying a deletion in either ORF8, ORF9, or one of the previously sequenced ORFs 17 and 18 have been constructed and shown to accumulate 3-alpha-mycarosyl erythronolide B, as expected for eryC mutants. The ORF13 (eryBIV), ORF17 (eryCIV) and ORF7 (eryBII) mutants also synthesised small amounts of macrolide shunt metabolites, as shown by mass spectrometry. These results considerably strengthen previous tentative proposals for the pathways for the biosynthesis of dTDP-D-desosamine and dTDP-L-mycarose in Sac. erythraea and reveal that at least some of these enzymes can accommodate alternative substrates.	1
Title: The loading domain of the erythromycin polyketide synthase is not essential for erythromycin biosynthesis in Saccharopolyspora erythraea Abstract: 6-Deoxyerythronolide B synthase (DEBS) is a large multifunctional enzyme that catalyses the biosynthesis of the erythromycin polyketide aglycone. DEBS is organized into six modules, each containing the enzymic domains required for a single condensation of carboxylic acid residues which make up the growing polyketide chain. Module 1 is preceded by loading acyltransferase (AT-L) and acyl carrier protein (ACP-L) domains, hypothesized to initiate polyketide chain growth with a propionate-derived moiety. Using recombinant DNA technology several mutant strains of Saccharopolyspora erythraea were constructed that lack the initial AT-L domain or that lack both the AT-L and ACP-L domains. These strains were still able to produce erythromycin, although at much lower levels than that produced by the wild-type strain. In addition, the AT-L domain expressed as a monofunctional enzyme was able to complement the deletion of this domain from the PKS, resulting in increased levels of erythromycin production. These findings indicate that neither the initial AT-L nor the ACP-L domains are required to initiate erythromycin biosynthesis; however, without these domains the efficiency of erythromycin biosynthesis is decreased significantly. It is proposed that in these mutants the first step in erythromycin biosynthesis is the charging of KS1 with propionate directly from propionyl-CoA.	1
Title: Analysis of seven genes from the eryAI-eryK region of the erythromycin biosynthetic gene cluster in Saccharopolyspora erythraea Abstract: The gene cluster (ery) governing the biosynthesis of the macrolide antibiotic erythromycin A by Saccharopolyspora erythraea contains, in addition to the eryA genes encoding the polyketide synthase, two regions containing genes for later steps in the pathway. The region 5' of eryA, and lying between eryA and the gene eryK, which is known to encode the C-12 hydroxylase, has been sequenced and shown to contain seven additional open reading frames (ORFs 13-19). On the basis of sequence similarities, roles are proposed for several of these ORFs in the biosynthesis of the deoxysugar mycarose and the deoxyaminosugar desosamine. A chromosomal mutant carrying a deletion in ORF15 has been constructed and shown to accumulate 3-O-mycarosylerythronolide B, as expected for an eryC mutant. Similarly, a chromosomal mutant carrying a deletion in ORF16 has been constructed and shown to accumulate erythronolide B, as expected for an eryB mutant.	1
Title: Sequencing and mutagenesis of genes from the erythromycin biosynthetic gene cluster of Saccharopolyspora erythraea that are involved in L-mycarose and D-desosamine production Abstract: The nucleotide sequence on both sides of the eryA polyketide synthase genes of the erythromycin-producing bacterium Saccharopolyspora erythraea reveals the presence of ten genes that are involved in L-mycarose (eryB) and D-desosamine (eryC) biosynthesis or attachment. Mutant strains carrying targeted lesions in eight of these genes indicate that three (eryBIV, eryBV and eryBVI) act in L-mycarose biosynthesis or attachment, while the other five (eryCII, eryCIII, eryCIV, eryCV and eryCVI) are devoted to D-desosamine biosynthesis or attachment. The remaining two genes (eryBII and eryBVII) appear to function in L-mycarose biosynthesis based on computer analysis and earlier genetic data. Three of these genes, eryBII, eryCIII and eryCII, lie between the eryAIII and eryG genes on one side of the polyketide synthase genes, while the remaining seven, eryBIV, eryBV, eryCVI, eryBVI, eryCIV, eryCV and eryBVII lie upstream of the eryAI gene on the other side of the gene cluster. The deduced products of these genes show similarities to: aldohexose 4-ketoreductases (eryBIV), aldoketo reductases (eryBII), aldohexose 5-epimerases (eryBVII), the dnmT gene of the daunomycin biosynthetic pathway of Streptomyces peucetius (eryBVI), glycosyltransferases (eryBV and eryCIII), the AscC 3,4-dehydratase from the ascarylose biosynthetic pathway of Yersinia pseudotuberculosis (eryCIV), and mammalian N-methyltransferases (eryCVI). The eryCII gene resembles a cytochrome P450, but lacks the conserved cysteine residue responsible for coordination of the haem iron, while the eryCV gene displays no meaningful similarity to other known sequences. From the predicted function of these and other known eryB and eryC genes, pathways for the biosynthesis of L-mycarose and D-desosamine have been deduced.	1
Title: Cloning and heterologous expression of the genes encoding nonspecific electron transport components for a cytochrome P450 system of Saccharopolyspora erythraea involved in erythromycin production Abstract: The forA gene encoding a protein that can function as a NADH:ferredoxin oxidoreductase (For) has been cloned from Saccharopolyspora erythraea, the erythromycin A (ErA) producer. In a previous study For protein, together with the FdxA ferredoxin from the same organism, was shown to be able to reconstitute the cytochrome P450 system responsible for the hydroxylation of 6-deoxyerythronolide B, an intermediate of ErA biosynthesis. Nucleotide sequence data suggest that the cloned forA gene codes for For, the putative pyruvate dehydrogenase component, dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase, or its close homolog. Overexpression of forA appeared to be toxic to Escherichia coli.	1
Title: Structure of cytochrome P450eryF involved in erythromycin biosynthesis Abstract: Cytochrome P450eryF catalyzes the 6S-hydroxylation of 6-deoxyerythronolide B, the initial reaction in a multistep pathway to convert 6-deoxyerythronolide B into the antibiotic, erythromycin. The overall structure of P450eryF is similar to that of P450cam but differs in the exact positioning of several alpha-helices. The largest difference occurs in the B' helix and results in the enlargement of the substrate-binding pocket of P450eryF. The substrate is positioned with the macrolide ring perpendicular to the haem plane and contacts seven hydrophobic residues and three solvent molecules. The substrate participates in a network of hydrogen bonds that may provide a proton shuttle pathway in the oxygen cleavage reaction.	1
Title: Inhibition of erythromycin synthesis by disruption of malonyl-coenzyme A decarboxylase gene eryM in Saccharopolyspora erythraea Abstract: Malonyl-coenzyme A (malonyl-CoA) decarboxylase is widely distributed in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. However, the biological function of this enzyme has not been established in any organism. To elucidate the structure and function of this enzyme, the malonyl-CoA decarboxylase gene from Saccharopolyspora erythraea (formerly Streptomyces erythreaus) was cloned and sequenced. This gene would encode a polypeptide of 417 amino acids. The deduced amino acid sequence matched the experimentally determined amino acid sequences of 25 N-terminal residues each of the enzyme and of an internal peptide obtained by proteolysis of the purified enzyme. This decarboxylase showed homology with aminoglycoside N6'-acetyltransferases of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Northern (RNA) blot analysis revealed a single transcript. The transcription initiation site was 220 bp upstream of the start codon. When expressed in Escherichia coli, the S. erythraea malonyl-CoA decarboxylase gene yielded a protein that cross-reacted with antiserum prepared against S. erythraea malonyl-CoA decarboxylase and catalyzed decarboxylation of [3-14C]malonyl-CoA to acetyl-CoA and 14CO2. The S. erythraea malonyl-CoA decarboxylase gene was disrupted by homologous recombination using an integrating vector pWHM3. The gene-disrupted transformant did not produce immunologically cross-reacting 45-kDa decarboxylase, lacked malonyl-CoA decarboxylase activity, and could not produce erythromycin. Exogenous propionate restored the ability to produce erythromycin. These results strongly suggest that the decarboxylase provides propionyl-CoA for erythromycin synthesis probably via decarboxylation of methylmalonyl-CoA derived from succinyl-CoA, and therefore the malonyl-CoA decarboxylase gene is designated eryM. The gene disrupted mutants also did not produce pigments.	1
Title: Substrate specificity of 6-deoxyerythronolide B hydroxylase, a bacterial cytochrome P450 of erythromycin A biosynthesis Abstract: The 6-deoxyerythronolide B hydroxylase (EryF) is a soluble cytochrome P450 responsible for the stereospecific C-6 hydroxylation of the erythromycin precursor, 6-deoxyerythronolide B. Using the expression of the eryF gene in Escherichia coli [Andersen, J. F., & Hutchinson, C. R. (1992) J. Bacteriol. 174, 725-735] as the enzyme source, we examined the catalytic activity of the EryF protein toward several macrolide substrates related to 6-deoxyerythronolide B. The results of these studies were compared with measurements of the apparent dissociation constants for various substrates and with information from molecular modeling studies of the substrates and the enzyme-substrate complex. Only minor changes in the structure of 6-deoxyerythronolide B resulted in substrates with catalytic rates less than 1% of those seen with the natural substrate. Although the 9S epimer of 9-deoxo-9-hydroxy-6-deoxyerythronolide B was hydroxylated at a rate approximately equal to the natural substrate, the 9R epimer was hydroxylated at a 2-fold lower rate. Examination of molecular models revealed that the position of the 9-hydroxyl oxygen in the 9S epimer resembles that of the 9-oxo oxygen in the natural substrate more closely than in the 9R epimer. 8,8a-Deoxyoleandolide, which is identical to 6-deoxyerythronolide B except for the presence of a C-13 methyl group, and its (9S)-9-deoxo-9-hydroxy derivative were C-6 hydroxylated at a 4-fold lower rate than the natural substrate, and the 9-oxo form showed a substantially larger apparent dissociation constant.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)	1
Title: Identification of a Saccharopolyspora erythraea gene required for the final hydroxylation step in erythromycin biosynthesis Abstract: In analyzing the region of the Saccharopolyspora erythraea chromosome responsible for the biosynthesis of the macrolide antibiotic erythromycin, we identified a gene, designated eryK, located about 50 kb downstream of the erythromycin resistance gene, ermE. eryK encodes a 44-kDa protein which, on the basis of comparative analysis, belongs to the P450 monooxygenase family. An S. erythraea strain disrupted in eryK no longer produced erythromycin A but accumulated the B and D forms of the antibiotic, indicating that eryK is responsible for the C-12 hydroxylation of the macrolactone ring, one of the last steps in erythromycin biosynthesis.	1
Title: Identification of DEBS 1, DEBS 2 and DEBS 3, the multienzyme polypeptides of the erythromycin-producing polyketide synthase from Saccharopolyspora erythraea Abstract: The ery A region of the erythromycin biosynthetic gene cluster of Saccharopolyspora erythraea has previously been shown to contain three large open reading frames (ORFs) that encode the components of 6-deoxyerythronolide B synthase (DEBS). Polyclonal antibodies were raised against recombinant proteins obtained by overexpression of 3' regions of the ORF2 and ORF3 genes. In Western blotting experiments, each antiserum reacted strongly with a different high molecular weight protein in extracts of erythromycin-producing S. erythraea cells. These putative DEBS 2 and DEBS 3 proteins were purified and subjected to N-terminal sequence analysis. The protein sequences were entirely consistent with the and DEBS 3 proteins were purified and subjected to N-terminal sequence analysis. The protein sequences were entirely consistent with the translation start sites predicted from the DNA sequences of ORFs 2 and 3. A third high molecular weight protein co-purified with DEBS 2 and DEBS 3 and had an N-terminal sequence that matched a protein sequence translated from the DNA sequence some 155 base pairs upstream from the previously proposed start codon of ORF1.	1
Title: Cloning and sequence analysis of genes involved in erythromycin biosynthesis in Saccharopolyspora erythraea: sequence similarities between EryG and a family of S-adenosylmethionine-dependent methyltransferases Abstract: The gene cluster (ery) responsible for production of the macrolide antibiotic erythromycin by Saccharopolyspora erythraea is also known to contain ermE, the gene conferring resistance to the antibiotic. The nucleotide sequence has been determined of a 4.5 kb portion of the biosynthetic gene cluster, from a region lying between 3.7 kb and 8.2 kb 3' of ermE. This has revealed the presence of four complete open reading frames, including the previously known ery gene eryG, which catalyses the last step in the biosynthetic pathway. Comparison of the amino acid sequence of EryG with the sequence of other S-adenosylmethionine (SAM)-dependent methyltransferases has revealed that one of the sequence motifs previously suggested to be part of the SAM-binding site is present not only in EryG but also in many other recently sequenced SAM-dependent methyltransferases. Previous genetic studies have shown that this region also contains gene(s) involved in hydroxylation of the intermediate 6-deoxyerythronolide B. One of the three other open reading frames (eryF) in fact shows very high sequence similarity to known cytochrome P450 hydroxylases. An adjacent gene (ORF5) shows a strikingly high degree of similarity to prokaryotic and eukaryotic acyltransferases and thioesterases.	1
Title: An unusually large multifunctional polypeptide in the erythromycin-producing polyketide synthase of Saccharopolyspora erythraea Abstract: Erythromycin A, a clinically important polyketide antibiotic, is produced by the Gram-positive bacterium Saccharopolyspora erythraea. In an arrangement that seems to be generally true of antibiotic biosynthetic genes in Streptomyces and related bacteria like S. erythraea, the ery genes encoding the biosynthetic pathway to erythromycin are clustered around the gene (ermE) that confers self-resistance on S. erythraea. The aglycone core of erythromycin A is derived from one propionyl-CoA and six methylmalonyl-CoA units, which are incorporated head-to-tail into the growing polyketide chain, in a process similar to that of fatty-acid biosynthesis, to generate a macrolide intermediate, 6-deoxyerythronolide B. 6-Deoxyerythronolide B is converted into erythromycin A through the action of specific hydroxylases, glycosyltransferases and a methyltransferase. We report here the analysis of about 10 kilobases of DNA from S. erythraea, cloned by chromosome 'walking' outwards from the erythromycin-resistance determinant ermE, and previously shown to be essential for erythromycin biosynthesis. Partial sequencing of this region indicates that it encodes the synthase. Our results confirm this, and reveal a novel organization of the erythromycin-producing polyketide synthase, which provides further insight into the mechanism of chain assembly.	1
Title: Organization of a cluster of erythromycin genes in Saccharopolyspora erythraea Abstract: We used a series of gene disruptions and gene replacements to mutagenically characterize 30 kilobases of DNA in the erythromycin resistance gene (ermE) region of the Saccharopolyspora erythraea chromosome. Five previously undiscovered loci involved in the biosynthesis of erythromycin were found, eryBI, eryBII, eryCI, eryCII, and eryH; and three known loci, eryAI, eryG, and ermE, were further characterized. The new Ery phenotype, EryH, was marked by (i) the accumulation of the intermediate 6-deoxyerythronolide B (DEB), suggesting a defect in the operation of the C-6 hydroxylase system, and (ii) a block in the synthesis or addition reactions for the first sugar group. Analyses of ermE mutants indicated that ermE is the only gene required for resistance to erythromycin, and that it is not required for production of the intermediate erythronolide B (EB) or for conversion of the intermediate 3-alpha-mycarosyl erythronolide B (MEB) to erythromycin. Mutations in the eryB and eryC loci were similar to previously reported chemically induced eryB and eryC mutations blocking synthesis or attachment of the two erythromycin sugar groups. Insertion mutations in eryAI, the macrolactone synthetase, defined the largest (at least 9-kilobase) transcription unit of the cluster. These mutants help to define the physical organization of the erythromycin gene cluster, and the eryH mutants provide a source for the production of the intermediate DEB.	1
Title: Cloning of genes governing the deoxysugar portion of the erythromycin biosynthesis pathway in Saccharopolyspora erythraea (Streptomyces erythreus) Abstract: Genes that govern the formation of deoxysugars or their attachment to erythronolide B and 3 alpha-mycarosyl erythronolide B, intermediates of the biosynthesis of the 14-membered macrolide antibiotic erythromycin, were cloned from Saccharopolyspora erythraea (formerly Streptomyces erythreus). Segments of DNA that complement the eryB25, eryB26, eryB46, eryC1-60, and eryD24 mutations blocking the formation of erythronolide B or 3 alpha-mycarosyl erythronolide B, when cloned in Escherichia coli-Streptomyces shuttle cosmids or plasmid vectors that can transform S. erythraea, were located in a ca. 18-kilobase-pair region upstream of the erythromycin resistance (ermE) gene. The eryC1 gene lies just to the 5' side of ermE, and one (or possibly two) eryB gene is approximately 12 kilobase pairs farther upstream. Another eryB gene may be in the same region, while an additional eryB mutation appears to be located elsewhere. The eryD gene lies between the eryB and eryC1 genes and may regulate their function on the basis of the phenotype of an EryD- mutant.	1
Title: Molecular characterization of a gene from Saccharopolyspora erythraea (Streptomyces erythraeus) which is involved in erythromycin biosynthesis Abstract: A 7.3 kbp DNA fragment, encompassing the erythromycin (Em) resistance gene (ermE) and a portion of the gene cluster encoding the biosynthetic genes for erythromycin biosynthesis in Saccharopolyspora erythraea (formerly Streptomyces erythraeus) has been cloned in Streptomyces lividans using the plasmid vector pIJ702, and its nucleotide sequence has been determined using a modified dideoxy chain-termination procedure. In particular, we have examined the region immediately 5' of the resistance determinant, where the tandem promoters for ermE overlap the promoters for a divergently transcribed coding sequence (ORF). Disruption of this ORF using an integrational pIJ702-based plasmid vector gave mutants which were specifically blocked in erythromycin biosynthesis, and which accumulated 3-O-alpha-L-mycarosylerythronolide B: this behaviour is identical to that of previously described eryC1 mutants. The eryC1-gene product, a protein of subunit Mr 39,200, is therefore involved either as a structural or as a regulatory gene in the formation of the deoxyamino-sugar desosamine or in its attachment to the macrolide ring.	1
Title: Identification of a gene required for the terminal step in erythromycin A biosynthesis in Saccharopolyspora erythraea (Streptomyces erythreus) Abstract: We have identified a transcription unit in the ermE region of the chromosome of the erythromycin (Er)-producing bacterium Saccharopolyspora erythraea (Streptomyces erythreus) that is briefly switched on at about the time that macrolide production commences. Disruption of the transcription unit, herein designated eryG, by insertion of an integrational plasmid vector, caused a block at the terminal step in the biosynthesis of erythromycin, the conversion of erythromycin C to A by O-methylation.	1
Title: Rapid PCR amplification of minimal enediyne polyketide synthase cassettes leads to a predictive familial classification model Abstract: A universal PCR method for the rapid amplification of minimal enediyne polyketide synthase (PKS) genes and the application of this methodology to clone remaining prototypical genes from producers of structurally determined enediynes in both family types are presented. A phylogenetic analysis of the new pool of bona fide enediyne PKS genes, consisting of three from 9-membered producers (neocarzinostatin, C1027, and maduropeptin) and three from 10-membered producers (calicheamicin, dynemicin, and esperamicin), reveals a clear genotypic distinction between the two structural families from which to form a predictive model. The results from this study support the postulation that the minimal enediyne PKS helps define the structural divergence of the enediyne core and provides the key tools for generating enediyne hybrid genes/molecular scaffolds; by using the model, a classification is also provided for the unknown enediyne PKS genes previously identified via genome scanning.	1
Title: Molecular genetic analysis of the orsellinic acid/F9775 gene cluster of Aspergillus nidulans Abstract: F-9775A and F-9775B are cathepsin K inhibitors that arise from a chromatin remodelling deletant strain of Aspergillus nidulans. A polyketide synthase gene has been determined to be responsible for their formation and for the simpler, archetypical polyketide orsellinic acid. We have discovered simple culture conditions that result in the production of the three compounds, and this facilitates analysis of the genes responsible for their synthesis. We have now analysed the F9775/orsellinic acid gene cluster using a set of targeted deletions. We find that the polyketide synthase alone is required for orsellinic acid biosynthesis and only two additional genes in the cluster are required for F9775 A and B synthesis. Our deletions also yielded the bioactive metabolites gerfelin and diorcinol.	1
Title: Intimate bacterial-fungal interaction triggers biosynthesis of archetypal polyketides in Aspergillus nidulans Abstract: Fungi produce numerous low molecular weight molecules endowed with a multitude of biological activities. However, mining the full-genome sequences of fungi indicates that their potential to produce secondary metabolites is greatly underestimated. Because most of the biosynthesis gene clusters are silent under laboratory conditions, one of the major challenges is to understand the physiological conditions under which these genes are activated. Thus, we cocultivated the important model fungus Aspergillus nidulans with a collection of 58 soil-dwelling actinomycetes. By microarray analyses of both Aspergillus secondary metabolism and full-genome arrays and Northern blot and quantitative RT-PCR analyses, we demonstrate at the molecular level that a distinct fungal-bacterial interaction leads to the specific activation of fungal secondary metabolism genes. Most surprisingly, dialysis experiments and electron microscopy indicated that an intimate physical interaction of the bacterial and fungal mycelia is required to elicit the specific response. Gene knockout experiments provided evidence that one induced gene cluster codes for the long-sought after polyketide synthase (PKS) required for the biosynthesis of the archetypal polyketide orsellinic acid, the typical lichen metabolite lecanoric acid, and the cathepsin K inhibitors F-9775A and F-9775B. A phylogenetic analysis demonstrates that orthologs of this PKS are widespread in nature in all major fungal groups, including mycobionts of lichens. These results provide evidence of specific interaction among microorganisms belonging to different domains and support the hypothesis that not only diffusible signals but intimate physical interactions contribute to the communication among microorganisms and induction of otherwise silent biosynthesis genes.	1
Title: Cloning and characterization of the biosynthetic gene cluster of 16-membered macrolide antibiotic FD-891: involvement of a dual functional cytochrome P450 monooxygenase catalyzing epoxidation and hydroxylation Abstract: FD-891 is a 16-membered cytotoxic antibiotic macrolide that is especially active against human leukemia such as HL-60 and Jurkat cells. We identified the FD-891 biosynthetic (gfs) gene cluster from the producer Streptomyces graminofaciens A-8890 by using typical modular type I polyketide synthase (PKS) genes as probes. The gfs gene cluster contained five typical modular type I PKS genes (gfsA, B, C, D, and E), a cytochrome P450 gene (gfsF), a methyltransferase gene (gfsG), and a regulator gene (gfsR). The gene organization of PKSs agreed well with the basic polyketide skeleton of FD-891 including the oxidation states and alpha-alkyl substituent determined by the substrate specificities of the acyltransferase (AT) domains. To clarify the involvement of the gfs genes in the FD-891 biosynthesis, the P450 gfsF gene was inactivated; this resulted in the loss of FD-891 production. Instead, the gfsF gene-disrupted mutant accumulated a novel FD-891 analogue 25-O-methyl-FD-892, which lacked the epoxide and the hydroxyl group of FD-891. Furthermore, the recombinant GfsF enzyme coexpressed with putidaredoxin and putidaredoxin reductase converted 25-O-methyl-FD-892 into FD-891. In the course of the GfsF reaction, 10-deoxy-FD-891 was isolated as an enzymatic reaction intermediate, which was also converted into FD-891 by GfsF. Therefore, it was clearly found that the cytochrome P450 GfsF catalyzes epoxidation and hydroxylation in a stepwise manner in the FD-891 biosynthesis. These results clearly confirmed that the identified gfs genes are responsible for the biosynthesis of FD-891 in S. graminofaciens.	1
Title: Genome mining of the Streptomyces avermitilis genome and development of genome-minimized hosts for heterologous expression of biosynthetic gene clusters Abstract: To date, several actinomycete genomes have been completed and annotated. Among them, Streptomyces microorganisms are of major pharmaceutical interest because they are a rich source of numerous secondary metabolites. S. avermitilis is an industrial microorganism used for the production of an anthelmintic agent, avermectin, which is a commercially important antiparasitic agent in human and veterinary medicine, and agricultural pesticides. Genome analysis of S. avermitilis provides significant information for not only industrial applications but also understanding the features of this genus. On genome mining of S. avermitilis, the microorganism has been found to harbor at least 38 secondary metabolic gene clusters and 46 insertion sequence (IS)-like sequences on the genome, which have not been searched so far. A significant use of the genome data of Streptomyces microorganisms is the construction of a versatile host for heterologous expression of exogenous biosynthetic gene clusters by genetic engineering. Since S. avermitilis is used as an industrial microorganism, the microorganism is already optimized for the efficient supply of primary metabolic precursors and biochemical energy to support multistep biosynthesis. The feasibility of large-deletion mutants of S. avermitilis has been confirmed by heterologous expression of more than 20 exogenous biosynthetic gene clusters.	1
Title: Elucidation of the biosynthetic gene cluster and the post-PKS modification mechanism for fostriecin in Streptomyces pulveraceus Abstract: Fostriecin is a unique phosphate monoester antibiotic that was isolated from Streptomyces pulveraceus as a protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) and PP4A selective inhibitor. However, its biosynthetic mechanism remains to be elucidated. In this study, a 73 kb gene cluster encoding a six modular Type I polyketide synthases (PKS) and seven tailoring enzymes was identified by cosmid sequencing from the producer. The functions of two tailoring enzymes were characterized by gene disruption and an in vitro enzyme activity assay. Remarkably, the isolation of three malonylated fostriecin analogs from post-PKS gene knockout mutants indicated malonylated-polyketide formation could be a normal biosynthetic process in the formation of the unsaturated six-membered lactone in fostriecin. Based on this study, a comprehensive post-PKS modification mechanism for fostriecin biosynthesis was proposed.	1
Title: A polyketide synthase gene required for biosynthesis of fumonisin mycotoxins in Gibberella fujikuroi mating population A Abstract: Fumonisins are toxins associated with several mycotoxicoses and are produced by the maize pathogen Gibberella fujikuroi mating population A (MP-A). Biochemical analyses indicate that fumonisins are a product of either polyketide or fatty acid biosynthesis. To isolate a putative polyketide synthase (PKS) gene involved in fumonisin biosynthesis, we employed PCR with degenerate PKS primers and a cDNA template prepared from a fumonisin-producing culture of G. fujikuroi. Sequence analysis of the single PCR product and its flanking DNA revealed a gene (FUM5) with a 7.8-kb coding region. The predicted FUM5 translation product was highly similar to bacterial and fungal Type I PKSs. Transformation of a cosmid clone carrying FUM5 into G. fujikuroi enhanced production in three strains and restored wild-type production in a fumonisin nonproducing mutant. Disruption of FUM5 reduced fumonisin production by over 99% in G. fujikuroi MP-A. Together, these results indicate that FUM5 is a PKS gene required for fumonisin biosynthesis.	1
Title: Characterization of four clustered and coregulated genes associated with fumonisin biosynthesis in Fusarium verticillioides Abstract: Fumonisins are mycotoxins that cause several fatal animal diseases, including cancer in rats and mice. These toxins are produced by several Fusarium species, including the maize pathogen Fusarium verticillioides, and can accumulate in maize infected with the fungus. We have identified four F. verticillioides genes (FUM6, FUM7, FUM8, and FUM9) adjacent to FUM5, a previously identified polyketide synthase gene that is required for fumonisin biosynthesis. Gene disruption analysis revealed that FUM6 and FUM8 are required for fumonisin production and Northern blot analysis revealed that expression of all four recently identified genes is correlated with fumonisin production. Nucleotide sequence analysis indicated that the predicted FUM6 translation product is most similar to cytochrome P450 monooxygenase-P450 reductase fusion proteins and the predicted products of FUM7, FUM8, and FUM9 are most similar to type III alcohol dehydrogenases, class-II alpha-aminotransferases, and dioxygenases, respectively. Together, these data are consistent with FUM5 through FUM9 being part of a fumonisin biosynthetic gene cluster in F. verticillioides.	1
Title: FUM1--a gene required for fumonisin biosynthesis but not for maize ear rot and ear infection by Gibberella moniliformis in field tests Abstract: We have analyzed the role of fumonisins in infection of maize (Zea mays) by Gibberella moniliformis (anamorph Fusarium verticillioides) in field tests in Illinois and Iowa, United States. Fumonisin-nonproducing mutants were obtained by disrupting FUM1 (previously FUM5), the gene encoding a polyketide synthase required for fumonisin biosynthesis. Maize ear rot, ear infection, and fumonisin contamination were assessed by silk-channel injection in 1999 and 2000 and also by spray application onto maize silks, injection into maize stalks, and application with maize seeds at planting in 1999. Ear rot was evaluated by visual assessment of whole ears and by calculating percentage of symptomatic kernels by weight. Fumonisin levels in kernels were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. The presence of applied strains in kernels was determined by analysis of recovered isolates for genetic markers and fumonisin production. Two independent fumonisin-nonproducing (fum1-3 and fum1-4) mutants were similar to their respective fumonisin-producing (FUM1-1) progenitor strains in ability to cause ear rot following silk-channel injection and also were similar in ability to infect maize ears following application by all four methods tested. This evidence confirms that fumonisins are not required for G. moniliformis to cause maize ear rot and ear infection.	1
Title: Co-expression of 15 contiguous genes delineates a fumonisin biosynthetic gene cluster in Gibberella moniliformis Abstract: Fumonisins are mycotoxins produced by the maize pathogen Gibberella moniliformis and are associated with cancer in rodents. In this study, we determined the nucleotide sequence of a 75-kb region of G. moniliformis DNA and identified 18 heretofore undescribed genes flanking a cluster of five previously identified fumonisin biosynthetic (FUM) genes. Ten of the newly identified genes downstream of the cluster were coregulated with FUM genes and exhibited patterns of expression that were correlated with fumonisin production. BLASTX analyses indicated that the predicted functions of proteins encoded by the 10 genes were consistent with activities expected for fumonisin biosynthesis or self-protection. These data indicate that the 10 newly identified genes and the previously identified FUM genes constitute a fumonisin biosynthetic gene cluster. Disruption of two of the new genes, encoding longevity assurance factors, had no apparent effect on fumonisin production, but disruption of a third, encoding an ABC transporter, had a subtle effect on ratios of fumonisins produced.	1
Title: FUM9 is required for C-5 hydroxylation of fumonisins and complements the meitotically defined Fum3 locus in Gibberella moniliformis Abstract: Deletion of the Gibberella moniliformis FUM9 gene resulted in mutants that produce only fumonisins that lack a C-5 hydroxyl group. This phenotype is identical to that of previously described mutants with defective alleles at the meiotically defined Fum3 locus. Transformation with a wild-type FUM9 gene into a Fum3-defective mutant restored wild-type fumonisin production. These results indicate that the FUM9 protein catalyzes the C-5 hydroxylation of fumonisins and that FUM9 and the Fum3 locus are the same gene.	1
Title: Fumonisin production in the maize pathogen Fusarium verticillioides: genetic basis of naturally occurring chemical variation Abstract: Fumonisins are polyketide-derived mycotoxins produced by the maize pathogen Fusarium verticillioides. Previous analyses identified naturally occurring variants of the fungus that are deficient in fumonisin C-10 hydroxylation or that do not produce any fumonisins. In the current study, gene deletion and genetic complementation analyses localized the C-10 hydroxylation deficiency to a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase gene in the fumonisin biosynthetic gene (FUM) cluster. Sequence analysis indicated that the hydroxylation deficiency resulted from a single nucleotide insertion that caused a frame shift in the coding region of the gene. Genetic complementation localized the fumonisin-nonproduction phenotype to the polyketide synthase gene in the FUM cluster, and sequence analysis indicated that the nonproduction phenotype resulted from a nucleotide substitution, which introduced a premature stop codon in the coding region. These results provide the first direct evidence that altered fumonisin production phenotypes of naturally occurring F. verticillioides variants can result from single point mutations in the FUM cluster.	1
Title: The Fusarium verticillioides FUM gene cluster encodes a Zn(II)2Cys6 protein that affects FUM gene expression and fumonisin production Abstract: Fumonisins are mycotoxins produced by some Fusarium species and can contaminate maize or maize products. Ingestion of fumonisins is associated with diseases, including cancer and neural tube defects, in humans and animals. In fungi, genes involved in the synthesis of mycotoxins and other secondary metabolites are often located adjacent to each other in gene clusters. Such genes can encode structural enzymes, regulatory proteins, and/or proteins that provide self-protection. The fumonisin biosynthetic gene cluster includes 16 genes, none of which appear to play a role in regulation. In this study, we identified a previously undescribed gene (FUM21) located adjacent to the fumonisin polyketide synthase gene, FUM1. The presence of a Zn(II)2Cys6 DNA-binding domain in the predicted protein suggested that FUM21 was involved in transcriptional regulation. FUM21 deletion (Deltafum21) mutants produce little to no fumonisin in cracked maize cultures but some FUM1 and FUM8 transcripts in a liquid GYAM medium. Complementation of a Deltafum21 mutant with a wild-type copy of the gene restored fumonisin production. Analysis of FUM21 cDNAs identified four alternative splice forms (ASFs), and microarray analysis indicated the ASFs were differentially expressed. Based on these data, we present a model for how FUM21 ASFs may regulate fumonisin biosynthesis.	1
Title: Self-Protection against the Sphingolipid Biosynthesis Inhibitor Fumonisin B1 Is Conferred by a FUM Cluster-Encoded Ceramide Synthase Abstract: Fumonisin (FB) mycotoxins produced by species of the genus Fusarium detrimentally affect human and animal health upon consumption, due to the inhibition of ceramide synthase. In the present work, we set out to identify mechanisms of self-protection employed by the FB1 producer Fusarium verticillioides FB1 biosynthesis was shown to be compartmentalized, and two cluster-encoded self-protection mechanisms were identified. First, the ATP-binding cassette transporter Fum19 acts as a repressor of the FUM gene cluster. Appropriately, FUM19 deletion and overexpression increased and decreased, respectively, the levels of intracellular and secreted FB1 Second, the cluster genes FUM17 and FUM18 were shown to be two of five ceramide synthase homologs in Fusarium verticillioides, grouping into the two clades CS-I and CS-II in a phylogenetic analysis. The ability of FUM18 to fully complement the yeast ceramide synthase null mutant LAG1/LAC1 demonstrated its functionality, while coexpression of FUM17 and CER3 partially complemented, likely via heterodimer formation. Cell viability assays revealed that Fum18 contributes to the fungal self-protection against FB1 and increases resistance by providing FUM cluster-encoded ceramide synthase activity.IMPORTANCE The biosynthesis of fungal natural products is highly regulated not only in terms of transcription and translation but also regarding the cellular localization of the biosynthetic pathway. In all eukaryotes, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is involved in the production of organelles, which are subject to cellular traffic or secretion. Here, we show that in Fusarium verticillioides, early steps in fumonisin production take place in the ER, together with ceramide biosynthesis, which is targeted by the mycotoxin. A first level of self-protection is given by the presence of a FUM cluster-encoded ceramide synthase, Fum18, hitherto uncharacterized. In addition, the final fumonisin biosynthetic step occurs in the cytosol and is thereby spatially separate from the fungal ceramide synthases. We suggest that these strategies help the fungus to avoid self-poisoning during mycotoxin production.	1
Title: A fumonisin biosynthetic gene cluster in Fusarium oxysporum strain O-1890 and the genetic basis for B versus C fumonisin production Abstract: Most species of Fusarium that produce fumonisin mycotoxins produce predominantly B fumonisins (FBs). However, Fusarium oxysporum strain O-1890 produces predominantly C fumonisins (FCs). In this study, the nucleotide sequence of the fumonisin biosynthetic gene (FUM) cluster in strain O-1890 was determined. The order and orientation of FUM genes were the same as in the previously described clusters in Fusarium verticillioides and Fusarium proliferatum. Coding regions of F. oxysporum and F. verticillioides FUM genes were 88-92% identical, but regions flanking the clusters did not share significant identity. The FUM cluster gene FUM8 encodes an alpha-oxoamine synthase, and fum8 mutants of F. verticillioides do not produce fumonisins. Complementation of a fum8 mutant with the F. verticillioidesFUM8 restored FB production. Complementation with F. oxysporumFUM8 also restored production, but the fumonisins produced were predominantly FCs. These data indicate that different orthologues of FUM8 determine whether Fusarium produces predominantly FBs or FCs.	1
Title: Fusarin C biosynthesis in Fusarium moniliforme and Fusarium venenatum Abstract: Fragments of polyketide synthase (PKS) genes were amplified from complementary DNA (cDNA) of the fusarin C producing filamentous fungi Fusarium moniliforme and Fusarium venenatum by using degenerate oligonucleotides designed to select for fungal PKS C-methyltransferase (CMeT) domains. The PCR products, which were highly homologous to fragments of known fungal PKS CMeT domains, were used to probe cDNA and genomic DNA (gDNA) libraries of F. moniliforme and F. venenatum. A 4.0 kb cDNA clone from F. venenatum was isolated and used to prepare a hygromycin-resistance knockout cassette, which was used to produce a fusarin-deficient strain of F. venenatum (kb = 1000 bp). Similarly, a 26 kb genomic fragment, isolated on two overlapping clones from F. moniliforme, encoded a complete iterative Type I PKS fused to an unusual nonribosomal peptide synthase module. Once again, targeted gene disruption produced a fusarin-deficient strain, thereby proving that this synthase is responsible for the first steps of fusarin biosynthesis.	1
Title: The methoxymalonyl-acyl carrier protein biosynthesis locus and the nearby gene with the beta-ketoacyl synthase domain are involved in the biosynthesis of galbonolides in Streptomyces galbus, but these loci are separate from the modular polyketide synthase gene cluster Abstract: Galbonolides A and B are antifungal compounds, which are produced by Streptomyces galbus. A multimodular polyketide synthase (PKS) was predicted to catalyze their biosynthesis, and a methoxymalonyl-acyl carrier protein (methoxymalonyl-ACP) was expected to be involved in the biosynthesis of galbonolide A. Cloning of a methoxymalonyl-ACP biosynthesis locus (galGHIJK) and the flanking regions has revealed that the locus is colocalized with beta-ketoacyl synthase (KAS)-related genes (orf3, 4, and 5), but separated from any multimodular PKS gene cluster in S. galbus. A galI-disruption mutant (SK-galI-5) is unable to produce galbonolide A, but can synthesize galbonolide B, indicating that galGHIJK is involved in the biosynthesis of galbonolide A. A disruption mutant of orf4 is severely impaired in the production of both galbonolides A and B. These results indicate that galGHIJK and the KAS genes are involved in the biosynthesis of galbonolides, although they are not colocalized with a multimodular PKS gene cluster. We further propose that a single galbonolide PKS generates two discrete structures, galbonolides A and B, by alternatively incorporating methoxymalonate and methylmalonate, respectively.	1
Title: A single module type I polyketide synthase directs de novo macrolactone biogenesis during galbonolide biosynthesis in Streptomyces galbus Abstract: Galbonolide (GAL) A and B are antifungal macrolactone polyketides produced by Streptomyces galbus. During their polyketide chain assembly, GAL-A and -B incorporate methoxymalonate and methylmalonate, respectively, in the fourth chain extension step. The methoxymalonyl-acyl carrier protein biosynthesis locus (galG to K) is specifically involved in GAL-A biosynthesis, and this locus is neighbored by a gene cluster composed of galA-E. GalA-C constitute a single module, highly reducing type I polyketide synthase (PKS). GalD and GalE are cytochrome P450 and Rieske domain protein, respectively. Gene knock-out experiments verified that galB, -C, and -D are essential for GAL biosynthesis. A galD mutant accumulated a GAL-C that lacked two hydroxyl groups and a double bond when compared with GAL-B. A [U-(13)C]propionate feeding experiment indicated that no rare precursor other than methoxymalonate was incorporated during GAL biogenesis. A search of the S. galbus genome for a modular type I PKS system, the type that was expected to direct GAL biosynthesis, resulted in the identification of only one modular type I PKS gene cluster. Homology analysis indicated that this PKS gene cluster is the locus for vicenistatin biosynthesis. This cluster was previously reported in Streptomyces halstedii. A gene deletion of the vinP2 ortholog clearly demonstrated that this modular type I PKS system is not involved in GAL biosynthesis. Therefore, we propose that GalA-C direct macrolactone polyketide formation for GAL. Our studies provide a glimpse into a novel biochemical strategy used for polyketide synthesis; that is, the iterative assembly of propionates with highly programmed β-keto group modifications.	1
Title: Cloning and characterization of a gene cluster for geldanamycin production in Streptomyces hygroscopicus NRRL 3602 Abstract: We illustrate the use of a PCR-based method by which the genomic DNA of a microorganism can be rapidly queried for the presence of type I modular polyketide synthase genes to clone and characterize, by sequence analysis and gene disruption, a major portion of the geldanamycin production gene cluster from Streptomyces hygroscopicus var. geldanus NRRL 3602.	1
Title: Characterization of tailoring genes involved in the modification of geldanamycin polyketide in Streptomyces hygroscopicus JCM4427 Abstract: Geldanamycin and its analogs are important anticancer agents that inhibit the newly targeted, heat-shock protein (Hsp) 90, which is a chaperone protein in eukaryotic cells. To resolve which geldanamycin biosynthetic genes are responsible for particular post-polyketide synthase (PKS) processing steps and in which order the reactions occur, we individually inactivated candidate genes in Streptomyces hygroscopicus subsp. duamyceticus JCM4427, and isolated and elucidated the structures of intermediates from each mutant. The results indicated that gel7 governs at least one of the benzoquinone ring oxidation steps. In addition, gel16 was found to be involved in double-bond formation between C-4 and C-5 of 4,5-dihydrogeldanamycin, which confirmed our previous findings that this double bond reduced during the post-PKS modification of the polyketide assembly. In addition, pro-geldanamycin, which does not possess a double bond at C-4/5, was purified from the gel7 and 8 double-gene-inactivated mutant.	1
