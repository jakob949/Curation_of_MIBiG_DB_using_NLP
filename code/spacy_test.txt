Title: Coumarin formation in novobiocin biosynthesis: beta-hydroxylation of the aminoacyl enzyme tyrosyl-S-NovH by a cytochrome P450 NovI Abstract: Background:                       Coumarin group antibiotics, such as novobiocin, coumermycin A1 and clorobiocin, are potent inhibitors of DNA gyrase. These antibiotics have been isolated from various Streptomyces species and all possess a 3-amino-4-hydroxy-coumarin moiety as their structural core. Prior labeling experiments on novobiocin established that the coumarin moiety was derived from L-tyrosine, probably via a beta-hydroxy-tyrosine (beta-OH-Tyr) intermediate. Recently the novobiocin gene cluster from Streptomyces spheroides was cloned and sequenced and allows analysis of the biosynthesis of the coumarin at the biochemical level using overexpressed and purified proteins.                  Results:                       Two open reading frames (ORFs), NovH and NovI, from the novobiocin producer S. spheroides have been overexpressed in Escherichia coli, purified and characterized for tyrosine activation and oxygenation which are the initial steps in coumarin formation. The 65 kDa NovH has two predicted domains, an adenylation (A) and a peptidyl carrier protein (PCP), reminiscent of non-ribosomal peptide synthetases. Purified NovH catalyzes L-tyrosyl-AMP formation by its A domain, can be posttranslationally phosphopantetheinylated on the PCP domain, and accumulates the covalent L-tyrosyl-S-enzyme intermediate on the holo PCP domain. The second enzyme in the pathway, NovI, is a 45 kDa heme protein that functions as a cytochrome P450-type monooxygenase with specificity for the tyrosyl-S-NovH acyl enzyme. The product beta-OH-tyrosyl-S-NovH was detected by alkaline release and high performance liquid chromatography analysis of radioactive [3H]beta-OH-Tyr and by mass spectrometry. Also detected was 4-OH-benzaldehyde, a retro aldol breakdown product of beta-OH-Tyr. The amino acid released was (3R,2S)-3-OH-Tyr by comparison with authentic standards.                  Conclusions:                       This work establishes that NovH and NovI are responsible for the formation of a beta-OH-Tyr intermediate that is covalently tethered to NovH in novobiocin biosynthesis. Comparable A-PCP/P450 pairs for amino acid beta-hydroxylation are found in various biosynthetic gene clusters, such as ORF19/ORF20 in the chloroeremomycin cluster for tyrosine, CumC/CumD in the coumermycin A1 cluster for tyrosine, and NikP1/NikQ in the nikkomycin cluster for histidine. This phenomenon of covalent docking of the amino acid in a kinetically stable thioester linkage prior to chemical modification by downstream tailoring enzymes, could represent a common strategy for controlling the partitioning of the amino acid for incorporation into secondary metabolites.	1
Title: Biosynthesis of the terpene phenalinolactone in Streptomyces sp. Tü6071: analysis of the gene cluster and generation of derivatives Abstract: Phenalinolactones are terpene glycosides with antibacterial activity. A striking structural feature is a highly oxidized gamma-butyrolactone of elusive biosynthetic origin. To investigate the genetic basis of the phenalinolactones biosynthesis, we cloned and sequenced the corresponding gene cluster from the producer strain Streptomyces sp. Tü6071. Spanning a 42 kbp region, 35 candidate genes could be assigned to putatively encode biosynthetic, regulatory, and resistance-conferring functions. Targeted gene inactivations were carried out to specifically manipulate the phenalinolactones pathway. The inactivation of a sugar methyltransferase gene and a cytochrome P450 monoxygenase gene led to the production of modified phenalinolactone derivatives. The inactivation of a Fe(II)/alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase gene disrupted the biosynthetic pathway within gamma-butyrolactone formation. The structure elucidation of the accumulating intermediate indicated that pyruvate is the biosynthetic precursor of the gamma butyrolactone moiety.	1
Title: Early steps in carotenoid biosynthesis: sequences and transcriptional analysis of the crtI and crtB genes of Rhodobacter sphaeroides and overexpression and reactivation of crtI in Escherichia coli and R. sphaeroides Abstract: In the purple photosynthetic bacterium Rhodobacter sphaeroides, the desaturation of phytoene has already been implicated in the assembly of the light-harvesting 2 complex (H.P. Lang and C.N. Hunter, Biochem. J. 298:197-205, 1994). The phytoene synthase and desaturase enzymes mediate the first steps specific for carotenoid biosynthesis up to and including the synthesis of the colored carotenoid neurosporene. In this report, we present the DNA and deduced amino acid sequences of the genes encoding these proteins, namely, crtB and crtI, from R. sphaeroides and present evidence for the existence of a crtIB operon. Both genes have been shown to possess putative puc and puf operon-like promoter sequences, and oxygen regulation and the point of initiation of the crtI transcript have been demonstrated. The complete crtI gene has been overexpressed in Escherichia coli and R. sphaeroides and shown to catalyze three desaturations of phytoene to give neurosporene. This activity was shown to be ATP dependent, and the cofactor requirement was investigated by using a spectroscopic assay for in vitro carotenogenic activity. Although the crtI and crtB genes have been sequenced from a number of different organisms, the transcriptional organization and regulation of these genes have not been analyzed in detail. In this report, we have located the transcription initiation point and have shown that R. sphaeroides possesses an oxygen-regulated CrtI-type phytoene desaturase gene that forms a transcriptional operon with crtB.	1
Title: Characterization and visualization of rat and guinea pig brain kappa opioid receptors: evidence for kappa 1 and kappa 2 opioid receptors Abstract: kappa opioid receptors (kappa receptors) have been characterized in homogenates of guinea pig and rat brain under in vitro binding conditions. kappa receptors were labeled by using the tritiated prototypic kappa opioid ethylketocyclazocine under conditions in which mu and delta opioid binding was suppressed. In the case of guinea pig brain membranes, a single population of high-affinity kappa opioid receptor sites (kappa sites; Kd = 0.66 nM, Bmax = 80 fmol/mg of protein) was observed. In contrast, in the case of rat brain, two populations of kappa sites were observed--high-affinity sites at low density (Kd = 1.0 nM, Bmax = 16 fmol/mg of protein) and low-affinity sites at high density (Kd = 13 nM, Bmax = 111 fmol/mg of protein). To test the hypothesis that the high- and low-affinity kappa sites represent two distinct kappa receptor subtypes, a series of opioids were tested for their abilities to compete for binding to the two sites. U-69,593 and Cambridge 20 selectively displaced the high-affinity kappa site in both guinea pig and rat tissue, but were inactive at the rat-brain low-affinity site. Other kappa opioid drugs, including U-50,488, ethylketocyclazocine, bremazocine, cyclazocine, and dynormphin (1-17), competed for binding to both sites, but with different rank orders of potency. Quantitative light microscopy in vitro autoradiography was used to visualize the neuroanatomical pattern of kappa receptors in rat and guinea pig brain. The distribution patterns of the two kappa receptor subtypes of rat brain were clearly different. The pattern of rat high-affinity kappa sites paralleled that of guinea pig in the caudate-putamen, mid-brain, central gray substance of cerebrum, and substantia nigra; interspecies differences were apparent throughout most of the rest of the brain. Collectively, these data provide direct evidence for the presence of two kappa receptor subtypes; the U-69,593-sensitive, high-affinity kappa 1 site predominates in guinea pig brain, and the U-69,593-insensitive, low-affinity kappa 2 site predominates in rat brain.	0
Title: Biosynthesis of diazepinomicin/ECO-4601, a Micromonospora secondary metabolite with a novel ring system Abstract: The novel microbial metabolite diazepinomicin/ECO-4601 (1) has a unique tricyclic dibenzodiazepinone core, which was unprecedented among microbial metabolites. Labeled feeding experiments indicated that the carbocyclic ring and the ring nitrogen of tryptophan could be incorporated via degradation to the 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid, forming ring A and the nonamide nitrogen of 1. Genomic analysis of the biosynthetic locus indicated that the farnesyl side chain was mevalonate derived, the 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid moiety could be formed directly from chorismate, and the third ring was constructed via 3-amino-5-hydroxybenzoic acid. Successful incorporation of 4,6-D2-3-hydroxyanthranilic acid into ring A of 1 via feeding experiments supports the genetic analysis and the allocation of the locus to this biosynthesis. These studies highlight the enzymatic complexity needed to produce this structural type, which is rare in nature.	1
Title: Analysis of the tetronomycin gene cluster: insights into the biosynthesis of a polyether tetronate antibiotic Abstract: The biosynthetic gene cluster for tetronomycin (TMN), a polyether ionophoric antibiotic that contains four different types of ring, including the distinctive tetronic acid moiety, has been cloned from Streptomyces sp. NRRL11266. The sequenced tmn locus (113 234 bp) contains six modular polyketide synthase (PKS) genes and a further 27 open-reading frames. Based on sequence comparison to related biosynthetic gene clusters, the majority of these can be assigned a plausible role in TMN biosynthesis. The identity of the cluster, and the requirement for a number of individual genes, especially those hypothesised to contribute a glycerate unit to the formation of the tetronate ring, were confirmed by specific gene disruption. However, two large genes that are predicted to encode together a multifunctional PKS of a highly unusual type seem not to be involved in this pathway since deletion of one of them did not alter tetronomycin production. Unlike previously characterised polyether PKS systems, oxidative cyclisation appears to take place on the modular PKS rather than after transfer to a separate carrier protein, while tetronate ring formation and concomitant chain release share common mechanistic features with spirotetronate biosynthesis.	1
Title: Discovery of potent and selective covalent inhibitors of JNK Abstract: The mitogen-activated kinases JNK1/2/3 are key enzymes in signaling modules that transduce and integrate extracellular stimuli into coordinated cellular response. Here, we report the discovery of irreversible inhibitors of JNK1/2/3. We describe two JNK3 cocrystal structures at 2.60 and 2.97 Å resolution that show the compounds form covalent bonds with a conserved cysteine residue. JNK-IN-8 is a selective JNK inhibitor that inhibits phosphorylation of c-Jun, a direct substrate of JNK, in cells exposed to submicromolar drug in a manner that depends on covalent modification of the conserved cysteine residue. Extensive biochemical, cellular, and pathway-based profiling establish the selectivity of JNK-IN-8 for JNK and suggests that the compound will be broadly useful as a pharmacological probe of JNK-dependent signal transduction. Potential lead compounds have also been identified for kinases, including IRAK1, PIK3C3, PIP4K2C, and PIP5K3.	0
Title: G-quadruplexes as versatile scaffolds for catalysis Abstract: DNA is receiving attention as a useful biomaterial in a broad range of research fields beyond its classical role as a biopolymer for storage and delivery of genetic information. Based on its chemical and thermal stability and easy accessibility, a series of DNA-based hybrid catalysts have been developed and successfully applied to various asymmetric reactions in water. Besides the canonical Watson-Crick duplex, the G-quadruplex structure has been actively exploited as horseradish-peroxidase (HRP)-mimicking DNAzymes via specific complexation with hemin. G-quadruplexes also provide a fascinating scaffold to develop a switchable catalytic system. This review summarizes the beginning, progress, and prospects of the noncanonical DNA-based hybrid catalysts, focusing on the G-quadruplexes as versatile scaffolds for catalysis.	0
Title: Bacterial responses to photo-oxidative stress Abstract: Singlet oxygen is one of several reactive oxygen species that can destroy biomolecules, microorganisms and other cells. Traditionally, the response to singlet oxygen has been termed photo-oxidative stress, as light-dependent processes in photosynthetic cells are major biological sources of singlet oxygen. Recent work identifying a core set of singlet oxygen stress response genes across various bacterial species highlights the importance of this response for survival by both photosynthetic and non-photosynthetic cells. Here, we review how bacterial cells mount a transcriptional response to photo-oxidative stress in the context of what is known about bacterial stress responses to other reactive oxygen species.	0
Title: Toblerols: Cyclopropanol-Containing Polyketide Modulators of Antibiosis in Methylobacteria Abstract: Trans-AT polyketide synthases (PKSs) are a family of biosynthetically versatile modular type I PKSs that generate bioactive polyketides of impressive structural diversity. In this study, we detected, in the genome of several bacteria a cryptic, architecturally unusual trans-AT PKS gene cluster which eluded automated PKS prediction. Genomic mining of one of these strains, the model methylotroph Methylobacterium extorquens AM1, revealed unique epoxide- and cyclopropanol-containing polyketides named toblerols. Relative and absolute stereochemistry were determined by NMR experiments, chemical derivatization, and the comparison of CD data between the derivatized natural product and a synthesized model compound. Biosynthetic data suggest that the cyclopropanol moiety is generated by carbon-carbon shortening of a more extended precursor. Surprisingly, a knock-out strain impaired in polyketide production showed strong inhibitory activity against other methylobacteria in contrast to the wild-type producer. The activity was inhibited by complementation with toblerols, thus suggesting that these compounds modulate an as-yet unknown methylobacterial antibiotic.	1
Title: Oryzines A & B, Maleidride Congeners from Aspergillus oryzae and Their Putative Biosynthesis Abstract: Aspergillus oryzae is traditionally used in East Asia for the production of food and brewing. In addition, it has been developed into a suitable host for the heterologous expression of natural product biosynthetic genes and gene clusters, enabling the functional analysis of the encoded enzymes. A. oryzae shares a 99.5% genome homology with Aspergillus flavus, but their secondary metabolomes differ significantly and various compounds unique to A. oryzae have been reported. While using A. oryzae as a host for heterologous expression experiments we discovered two new metabolites in extracts of A. oryzae M-2-3 with an unusual maleidride backbone, which were named oryzine A and B. Their structures were elucidated by high resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis. Their structural relationships with known maleidrides implied involvement of a citrate synthase (CS) and a polyketide (PKS) or fatty acid synthase (FAS) in their biosynthesis. Analysis of the A. oryzae genome revealed a single putative biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) consistent with the hypothetical biosynthesis of the oryzines. These findings increase knowledge of the chemical potential of A. oryzae and are the first attempt to link a novel product of this fungus with genomic data.	1
Title: Hybrid phase ligation for efficient synthesis of histone proteins Abstract: We introduce a hybrid solid-solution phase ligation approach that combines the efficiency of solid phase ligation with solution phase ligation in the total synthesis of modified histone proteins. A two linker strategy allows analysis throughout work on the solid phase and maximizes yields through cleavage at an external Rink, while an internal HMBA linker allows the native carboxyl terminus for any protein sequence. We demonstrate this approach for two histone proteins: triple-acetylated H4-K5ac, K12ac, K91ac and CENP-A-K124ac.	0
Title: Design and synthesis of chiral and regenerable [2.2]paracyclophane-based NAD(P)H models and application in biomimetic reduction of flavonoids Abstract: With the rapid development of biomimetic asymmetric reduction, the demand for efficient chiral and regenerable NAD(P)H models is growing rapidly. Herein, a new class of [2.2]paracyclophane-based chiral and regenerable NAD(P)H models (CYNAMs) was designed and synthesized. The first enantioselective biomimetic reduction of tetrasubstituted alkene flavonoids has been successfully realized through enzyme-like cooperative bifunctional activation, giving chiral flavanones with up to 99% yield and 99% ee.	0
Title: Multiplexed metagenome mining using short DNA sequence tags facilitates targeted discovery of epoxyketone proteasome inhibitors Abstract: In molecular evolutionary analyses, short DNA sequences are used to infer phylogenetic relationships among species. Here we apply this principle to the study of bacterial biosynthesis, enabling the targeted isolation of previously unidentified natural products directly from complex metagenomes. Our approach uses short natural product sequence tags derived from conserved biosynthetic motifs to profile biosynthetic diversity in the environment and then guide the recovery of gene clusters from metagenomic libraries. The methodology is conceptually simple, requires only a small investment in sequencing, and is not computationally demanding. To demonstrate the power of this approach to natural product discovery we conducted a computational search for epoxyketone proteasome inhibitors within 185 globally distributed soil metagenomes. This led to the identification of 99 unique epoxyketone sequence tags, falling into 6 phylogenetically distinct clades. Complete gene clusters associated with nine unique tags were recovered from four saturating soil metagenomic libraries. Using heterologous expression methodologies, seven potent epoxyketone proteasome inhibitors (clarepoxcins A-E and landepoxcins A and B) were produced from these pathways, including compounds with different warhead structures and a naturally occurring halohydrin prodrug. This study provides a template for the targeted expansion of bacterially derived natural products using the global metagenome.	1
Title: The posttranslational modification cascade to the thiopeptide berninamycin generates linear forms and altered macrocyclic scaffolds Abstract: Berninamycin is a member of the pyridine-containing thiopeptide class of antibiotics that undergoes massive posttranslational modifications from ribosomally generated preproteins. Berninamycin has a 2-oxazolyl-3-thiazolyl-pyridine core embedded in a 35-atom macrocycle rather than typical trithiazolylpyridine cores embedded in 26-atom and 29-atom peptide macrocycles. We describe the cloning of an 11-gene berninamycin cluster from Streptomyces bernensis UC 5144, its heterologous expression in Streptomyces lividans TK24 and Streptomyces venezuelae ATCC 10712, and detection of variant and incompletely processed scaffolds. Posttranslational maturation in S. lividans of both the wild-type berninamycin prepeptide (BerA) and also a T3A mutant generates macrocyclic compounds as well as linear variants, which have failed to form the pyridine and the macrocycle. Expression of the gene cluster in S. venezuelae generates a variant of the 35-atom skeleton of berninamycin, containing a methyloxazoline in the place of a methyloxazole within the macrocyclic framework.	1
Title: Kinetic properties of polymorphic variants and pathogenic mutants in human cystathionine gamma-lyase Abstract: Human cystathionine-gamma-lyase (CGL) is a pyridoxal-5'-phosphate (PLP)-dependent enzyme, which functions in the transsulfuration pathway that converts homocysteine to cysteine. In addition, CGL is one of two major enzymes that can catalyze the formation of hydrogen sulfide, an important gaseous signaling molecule. Recently, several mutations in CGL have been described in patients with cystathioninuria, a rare but poorly understood genetic disease. Moreover, a common single nucleotide polymorphism in CGL, c.1364G>T that converts serine at position 403 to isoleucine, has been linked to elevated plasma homocysteine levels. In this study, we have characterized the pathogenic T67I and Q240E missense mutations and the polymorphic variants at amino acid residues 403 using kinetic and spectrophotometric methods. We report that the polymorphism does not influence the cofactor content of the enzyme or its steady-state kinetic properties. In contrast, the T67I mutant exhibits a 3.5-fold decrease in V max compared to that of wild-type CGL, while the Q240E mutant exhibits a 70-fold decrease in V max. The K Ms for cystathionine for both pathogenic mutants are comparable to that of wild type CGL. The PLP content of the T67I and Q240E mutants were about 4-fold and 80-fold lower than that of wild-type enzyme, respectively. Preincubation of the T67I mutant with PLP restored activity to wild-type levels while the same treatment resulted in only partial restoration of activity of the Q240E mutant. These results reveal that both mutations weaken the affinity for PLP and suggest that cystathionuric patients with these mutations should be responsive to pyridoxine therapy.	0
Title: Two related pyrrolidinedione synthetase loci in Fusarium heterosporum ATCC 74349 produce divergent metabolites Abstract: Equisetin synthetase (EqiS), from the filamentous fungus Fusarium heterosporum ATCC 74349, was initially assigned on the basis of genetic knockout and expression analysis. Increasing inconsistencies in experimental results led us to question this assignment. Here, we sequenced the F. heterosporum genome, revealing two hybrid polyketide-peptide proteins that were candidates for the equisetin synthetase. The surrounding genes in both clusters had the needed auxiliary genes that might be responsible for producing equisetin. Genetic mutation, biochemical analysis, and recombinant expression in the fungus enabled us to show that the initially assigned EqiS does not produce equisetin but instead produces a related 2,4-pyrrolidinedione, fusaridione A, that was previously unknown. Fusaridione A is methylated in the 3-position of the pyrrolidinedione, which has not otherwise been found in natural products, leading to spontaneous reverse-Dieckmann reactions. A newly described gene cluster, eqx, is responsible for producing equisetin.	1
Title: Conformational Behaviour of Azasugars Based on Mannuronic Acid Abstract: A set of mannuronic-acid-based iminosugars, consisting of the C-5-carboxylic acid, methyl ester and amide analogues of 1deoxymannorjirimicin (DMJ), was synthesised and their pH-dependent conformational behaviour was studied. Under acidic conditions the methyl ester and the carboxylic acid adopted an "inverted" 1 C4 chair conformation as opposed to the "normal" 4 C1 chair at basic pH. This conformational change is explained in terms of the stereoelectronic effects of the ring substituents and it parallels the behaviour of the mannuronic acid ester oxocarbenium ion. Because of this solution-phase behaviour, the mannuronic acid ester azasugar was examined as an inhibitor for a Caulobacter GH47 mannosidase that hydrolyses its substrates by way of a reaction itinerary that proceeds through a 3 H4 transition state. No binding was observed for the mannuronic acid ester azasugar, but sub-atomic resolution data were obtained for the DMJ⋅CkGH47 complex, showing two conformations-3 S1 and 1 C4 -for the DMJ inhibitor.	0
Title: Characterization of the biosynthetic gene cluster of the polyene macrolide antibiotic reedsmycins from a marine-derived Streptomyces strain Abstract: Background:                       Polyene antibiotics are important as antifungal medicines albeit with serious side effects such as nephrotoxicity. Reedsmycin (RDM) A (1), produced by marine-derived Streptomyces youssoufiensis OUC6819, is a non-glycosylated polyene macrolide antibiotic with antifungal activity comparable to that of clinically used nystatin. To elucidate its biosynthetic machinery, herein, the rdm biosynthetic gene cluster was cloned and characterized.                  Results:                       The rdm cluster is located within a 104 kb DNA region harboring 21 open reading frames (ORFs), among which 15 ORFs were designated as rdm genes. The assembly line for RDM A is proposed on the basis of module and domain analysis of the polyketide synthetases (PKSs) RdmGHIJ, which catalyze 16 rounds of decarboxylative condensation using malonyl-CoA as the starter unit (loading module), two methylmalonyl-CoA (module 1 and 2), and fourteen malonyl-CoA (module 3-16) as extender units successively. However, the predicted substrate specificity of AT0 in the loading module is methylmalonyl-CoA instead of malonyl-CoA. Interestingly, the rdm cluster contains a five-gene regulation system RdmACDEF, which is different from other reported polyene gene clusters. In vivo experiments demonstrated the XRE family regulator RdmA and the PAS/LuxR family regulator RdmF function in negative and positive manner, respectively. Notably, inactivation of rdmA and overexpression of rdmF led to increased production of RDM A by ~ 2.0-fold and ~ 2.5-fold, reaching yields of 155.3 ± 1.89 and 184.8 ± 9.93 mg/L, respectively.                  Conclusions:                       Biosynthesis of RDM A is accomplished on a linear assembly line catalyzed by Rdm PKSs harboring a unique AT0 under the control of a complex regulatory system. These findings enable generation of new biologically active RDM derivatives at high yield and with improved properties by engineered biosynthesis.	1
Title: Genome Mining of the Lipopeptide Biosynthesis of Paenibacillus polymyxa E681 in Combination with Mass Spectrometry: Discovery of the Lipoheptapeptide Paenilipoheptin Abstract: Paenibacillus polymyxa strains are qualified for agro-biotechnological uses such as plant growth promotion and for biocontrol strategies against deleterious phytopathogenic competitors in the soil depending on their attractive arsenal of bioactive compounds. Moreover, they are potent producers of antibiotics for medical applications. To identify new products of such organisms, genome mining strategies in combination with mass spectrometry are the methods of choice. Herein, we performed such studies with the Paenibacillus strain E681. Bioinformatic evaluation of its genome sequence revealed four gene clusters A-D encoding nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs). Accordingly, four lipopeptide families were detected by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). Clusters A and D codify the well known fusaricidins and polymyxins. A yet-unknown lipoheptapeptide was discovered and structurally characterized by de novo sequencing by using MALDI-LIFT-TOF/TOF MS. It was designated as paenilipoheptin. From structure predictions we infer that the production of this agent is encoded by gene cluster C. Gene cluster B encodes the synthesis of tridecaptins, a family of open-chain lipotridecapeptides. Strain E681 produces new subspecies of such compounds (tridecaptins E) showing variations both in their fatty-acid part as well as in their peptide part.	1
Title: The Pseudomonas siderophore quinolobactin is synthesized from xanthurenic acid, an intermediate of the kynurenine pathway Abstract: To cope with iron deficiency fluorescent pseudomonads produce pyoverdines which are complex peptidic siderophores that very efficiently scavenge iron. In addition to pyoverdine some species also produce other siderophores. Recently, it was shown that Pseudomonas fluorescens ATCC 17400 produces the siderophore quinolobactin, an 8-hydroxy-4-methoxy-2-quinoline carboxylic acid (Mossialos, D., Meyer, J.M., Budzikiewicz, H., Wolff, U., Koedam, N., Baysse, C., Anjaiah, V., and Cornelis, P. (2000) Appl Environ Microbiol 66: 487-492). The entire quinolobactin biosynthetic, transport and uptake gene cluster, consisting out of two operons comprising 12 open reading frames, was cloned and sequenced. Based on the genes present and physiological complementation assays a biosynthetic pathway for quinolobactin is proposed. Surprisingly, this pathway turned out to combine genes derived from the eukaryotic tryptophan-xanthurenic acid branch of the kynurenine pathway and from the pathway for the biosynthesis of pyridine-2,6-bis(thiocarboxylic acid) from P. stutzeri, PDTC. These results clearly show the involvement of the tryptophan-kynurenine-xanthurenic acid pathway in the synthesis of an authentic quinoline siderophore.	1
Title: Unearthing a sesterterpene biosynthetic repertoire in the Brassicaceae through genome mining reveals convergent evolution Abstract: Sesterterpenoids are a rare terpene class harboring untapped chemodiversity and bioactivities. Their structural diversity originates primarily from the scaffold-generating sesterterpene synthases (STSs). In fungi, all six known STSs are bifunctional, containing C-terminal trans-prenyltransferase (PT) and N-terminal terpene synthase (TPS) domains. In plants, two colocalized PT and TPS gene pairs from Arabidopsis thaliana were recently reported to synthesize sesterterpenes. However, the landscape of PT and TPS genes in plant genomes is unclear. Here, using a customized algorithm for systematically searching plant genomes, we reveal a suite of physically colocalized pairs of PT and TPS genes for the biosynthesis of a large sesterterpene repertoire in the wider Brassicaceae. Transient expression of seven TPSs from A. thaliana, Capsella rubella, and Brassica oleracea in Nicotiana benthamiana yielded fungal-type sesterterpenes with tri-, tetra-, and pentacyclic scaffolds, and notably (-)-ent-quiannulatene, an enantiomer of the fungal metabolite (+)-quiannulatene. Protein and structural modeling analysis identified an amino acid site implicated in structural diversification. Mutation of this site in one STS (AtTPS19) resulted in premature termination of carbocation intermediates and accumulation of bi-, tri-, and tetracyclic sesterterpenes, revealing the cyclization path for the pentacyclic sesterterpene (-)-retigeranin B. These structural and mechanistic insights, together with phylogenetic analysis, suggest convergent evolution of plant and fungal STSs, and also indicate that the colocalized PT-TPS gene pairs in the Brassicaceae may have originated from a common ancestral gene pair present before speciation. Our findings further provide opportunities for rapid discovery and production of sesterterpenes through metabolic and protein engineering.	1
Title: Triterpenes from Pholiota populnea as Cytotoxic Agents and Chemosensitizers to Overcome Multidrug Resistance of Cancer Cells Abstract: The detailed mycochemical analysis of the n-hexane extract of Pholiota populnea led to the isolation of four new lanostane diesters, named pholiols A-D (1-4), together with an acyclic triterpene, (3S,6E,10E,14E,18E,22S)-2,3,22,23-tetrahydroxy-2,6,10,15,19,23-hexamethyl-6,10,14,18-tetracosatetraene (5), ergosterol (6), and 3β-hydroxyergosta-7,22-diene (7). The isolation was carried out by multistep flash chromatography, and the structures were elucidated using extensive spectroscopic analyses, including 1D and 2D NMR and MS measurements. The isolated metabolites (1-6) were investigated for cytotoxic activity against Colo205 and Colo320 colon adenocarcinoma and nontumoral MRC-5 cell lines. Among the tested compounds, ergosterol (6) showed substantial cytotoxic activity against all cell lines with IC50 values of 4.9 μM (Colo 205), 6.5 μM (Colo 320), and 0.50 μM (MRC) with no tumor cell selectivity. A P-glycoprotein efflux pump modulatory test on resistant Colo320 cells revealed that pholiols A (1) and B (2) and linear triterpene polyol 5 have the capacity to inhibit the efflux-pump overexpressed in the cells. Moreover, the drug interactions of triterpenes with doxorubicin were studied by the checkerboard method on Colo 320 cells. Pholiols B (2) and D (4) interacted in synergistic and acyclic triterpene 5 in a very strong synergistic manner; the combination index (CI) values at 50% of the growth inhibition dose (ED50) were found to be 0.348, 0.660, and 0.082, respectively. Our results indicate that P. populnea is a promising source for finding new triterpenes with significant chemosensitizing activity on cancer cells.	0
Title: Identification and characterization of the genes responsible for the production of the cyclic lipopeptide arthrofactin by Pseudomonas sp. MIS38 Abstract: Pseudomonas sp. MIS38 produces an effective biosurfactant named arthrofactin, which is a cyclic lipopeptide synthesized by a mega complex composed of three nonribosomal peptide synthetases. In order to gain insight into the control mechanism of arthrofactin production, a Tn5 mutant library was constructed and screened for arthrofactin-deficient mutants. Along with a number of mutations that occurred in the arthrofactin synthetase operon, three other mutants harbored distinct Tn5 insertions in the genes encoding SyrF-like protein (arfF), heat shock protein (htpG), and (p)ppGpp synthetase/hydrolase (spoT). Epistasis analyses revealed that spoT functions early in the arthrofactin production pathway. We also found that spoT affects MIS38 swarming, biofilm formation, and the cell morphology.	1
Title: Selection of Non- Saccharomyces Wine Yeasts for the Production of Leavened Doughs Abstract: Background:                       Non-conventional yeasts (NCY) (i.e., non-Saccharomyces) may be used as alternative starters to promote biodiversity and quality of fermented foods and beverages (e.g., wine, beer, bakery products).                  Methods:                       A total of 32 wine-associated yeasts (Campania region, Italy) were genetically identified and screened for decarboxylase activity and leavening ability. The best selected strains were used to study the leavening kinetics in model doughs (MDs). A commercial strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae was used as the control. The volatile organic profiles of the inoculated MDs were analyzed by solid phase microextraction/gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (SPME/GC-MS).                  Results:                       Most of strains belonged to the NCY species Hanseniaspora uvarum, Metschnikowia pulcherrima, Pichia kudriavzevii, Torulaspora delbruekii, and Zygotorulaspora florentina, while a few strains were S. cerevisiae. Most strains of H. uvarum lacked decarboxylase activity and showed a high leaving activity after 24 h of incubation that was comparable to the S. cerevisiae strains. The selected H. uvarum strains generated a different flavor profile of the doughs compared to the S. cerevisiae strains. In particular, NCY reduced the fraction of aldehydes that were potentially involved in oxidative phenomena.                  Conclusions:                       The use of NCY could be advantageous in the bakery industry, as they can provide greater diversity than S. cerevisiae-based products, and may be useful in reducing and avoiding yeast intolerance.	0
Title: Discovery of a novel (+)-γ-lactamase from Bradyrhizobium japonicum USDA 6 by rational genome mining Abstract: A novel (+)-γ-lactamase used for the resolution of racemic γ-lactam from Bradyrhizobium japonicum USDA 6 was found as a result of sequence-structure guided genome mining. It consists of 409 amino acids, only 49% of which are identical to the amino acid sequences of the known (+)-γ-lactamase from Sulfolobus solfataricus. This is only the third (+)-γ-lactamase gene to be reported.	0
Title: Thalassosamide, a Siderophore Discovered from the Marine-Derived Bacterium Thalassospira profundimaris Abstract: Here we describe the rapid identification and prioritization of novel active marine natural products using an improved dereplication strategy. During the course of our screening of marine natural product libraries, a new cyclic trihydroxamate compound, thalassosamide, was discovered from the α-proteobacterium Thalassospira profundimaris. Its structure was determined by 2D NMR and MS/MS experiments, and the absolute configuration of the lysine-derived units was established by Marfey's analysis, whereas that of C-9, 9', and 9″ was determined via the circular dichroism data of the [Rh2(OCOCF3)4] complex and DFT NMR calculations. Thalassosamide showed moderate in vivo efficacy against Pseudomonas aeruginosa.	0
Title: Applications of gene replacement technology to Streptomyces clavuligerus strain development for clavulanic acid production Abstract: Cephamycin C production was blocked in wild-type cultures of the clavulanic acid-producing organism Streptomyces clavuligerus by targeted disruption of the gene (lat) encoding lysine epsilon-aminotransferase. Specific production of clavulanic acid increased in the lat mutants derived from the wild-type strain by 2- to 2.5-fold. Similar beneficial effects on clavulanic acid production were noted in previous studies when gene disruption was used to block the production of the non-clavulanic acid clavams produced by S. clavuligerus. Therefore, mutations in lat and in cvm1, a gene involved in clavam production, were introduced into a high-titer industrial strain of S. clavuligerus to create a double mutant with defects in production of both cephamycin C and clavams. Production of both cephamycin C and non-clavulanic acid clavams was eliminated in the double mutant, and clavulanic acid titers increased about 10% relative to those of the parental strain. This represents the first report of the successful use of genetic engineering to eliminate undesirable metabolic pathways in an industrial strain used for the production of an antibiotic important in human medicine.	1
Title: Molecular cloning and genetic analysis of an indole-diterpene gene cluster from Penicillium paxilli Abstract: The indole-diterpene paxilline is a potent tremorgenic mammalian mycotoxin and a known inhibitor of maxi-K ion channels. The gene cluster responsible for paxilline biosynthesis in Penicillium paxilli was identified by mapping four large plasmid-induced chromosome deletions. The cluster is predicted to lie within a 50 kb region of chromosome Va and to contain 17 genes, including a geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP) synthase (paxG), two FAD-dependent monooxygenases (paxM and N), two cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (paxP and Q), a dimethylallyltryptophan (DMAT) synthase (paxD) and two possible transcription factors (paxR and paxS), which contain a Zn(II)2Cys6 DNA-binding motif. Targeted replacement of paxG confirmed that it is essential for paxilline biosynthesis but dispensable for growth. The GGPP for primary metabolism is predicted to be provided by a second GGPP synthase (ggs1) that was cloned, sequenced and mapped to chromosome IV. Semi-quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis demonstrated that the expression of paxG, paxM and paxP in submerged liquid cultures of P. paxilli increased dramatically with the onset of paxilline biosynthesis. In contrast, the expression of beta-tubulin (tub2) and ggs1 was not induced. This is the first description of the molecular cloning and genetic analysis of an indole-diterpene gene cluster.	1
Title: A feed-forward signalling circuit controls bacterial virulence through linking cyclic di-GMP and two mechanistically distinct sRNAs, ArcZ and RsmB Abstract: Dickeya dadantii is a plant pathogen that causes soft rot disease on vegetable and potato crops. To successfully cause infection, this pathogen needs to coordinately modulate the expression of genes encoding several virulence determinants, including plant cell wall degrading enzymes (PCWDEs), type III secretion system (T3SS) and flagellar motility. Here, we uncover a novel feed-forward signalling circuit for controlling virulence. Global RNA chaperone Hfq interacts with an Hfq-dependent sRNA ArcZ and represses the translation of pecT, encoding a LysR-type transcriptional regulator. We demonstrate that the ability of ArcZ to be processed to a 50 nt 3'- end fragment is essential for its regulation of pecT. PecT down-regulates PCWDE and the T3SS by repressing the expression of a global post-transcriptional regulator- (RsmA-) associated sRNA encoding gene rsmB. In addition, we show that the protein levels of two cyclic di-GMP (c-di-GMP) diguanylate cyclases (DGCs), GcpA and GcpL, are repressed by Hfq. Further studies show that both DGCs are essential for the Hfq-mediated post-transcriptional regulation on RsmB. Overall, our report provides new insights into the interplays between ubiquitous signalling transduction systems that were most studied independently and sheds light on multitiered regulatory mechanisms for a precise disease regulation in bacteria.	0
Title: Modified 'one amino acid-one codon' engineering of high GC content TaqII-coding gene from thermophilic Thermus aquaticus results in radical expression increase Abstract: Background:                       An industrial approach to protein production demands maximization of cloned gene expression, balanced with the recombinant host's viability. Expression of toxic genes from thermophiles poses particular difficulties due to high GC content, mRNA secondary structures, rare codon usage and impairing the host's coding plasmid replication.TaqII belongs to a family of bifunctional enzymes, which are a fusion of the restriction endonuclease (REase) and methyltransferase (MTase) activities in a single polypeptide. The family contains thermostable REases with distinct specificities: TspGWI, TaqII, Tth111II/TthHB27I, TspDTI and TsoI and a few enzymes found in mesophiles. While not being isoschizomers, the enzymes exhibit amino acid (aa) sequence homologies, having molecular sizes of ~120 kDa share common modular architecture, resemble Type-I enzymes, cleave DNA 11/9 nt from the recognition sites, their activity is affected by S-adenosylmethionine (SAM).                  Results:                       We describe the taqIIRM gene design, cloning and expression of the prototype TaqII. The enzyme amount in natural hosts is extremely low. To improve expression of the taqIIRM gene in Escherichia coli (E. coli), we designed and cloned a fully synthetic, low GC content, low mRNA secondary structure taqIIRM, codon-optimized gene under a bacteriophage lambda (λ) PR promoter. Codon usage based on a modified 'one amino acid-one codon' strategy, weighted towards low GC content codons, resulted in approximately 10-fold higher expression of the synthetic gene. 718 codons of total 1105 were changed, comprising 65% of the taqIIRM gene. The reason for we choose a less effective strategy rather than a resulting in high expression yields 'codon randomization' strategy, was intentional, sub-optimal TaqII in vivo production, in order to decrease the high 'toxicity' of the REase-MTase protein.                  Conclusions:                       Recombinant wt and synthetic taqIIRM gene were cloned and expressed in E. coli. The modified 'one amino acid-one codon' method tuned for thermophile-coded genes was applied to obtain overexpression of the 'toxic' taqIIRM gene. The method appears suited for industrial production of thermostable 'toxic' enzymes in E. coli. This novel variant of the method biased toward increasing a gene's AT content may provide economic benefits for industrial applications.	0
Title: Microbial 5'-nucleotidases: their characteristics, roles in cellular metabolism, and possible practical applications Abstract: 5'-Nucleotidases (EC 3.1.3.5) are enzymes that catalyze the hydrolytic dephosphorylation of 5'-ribonucleotides and 5'-deoxyribonucleotides to their respective nucleosides and phosphate. Most 5'-nucleotidases have broad substrate specificity and are multifunctional enzymes capable of cleaving phosphorus from not only mononucleotide phosphate molecules but also a variety of other phosphorylated metabolites. 5'-Nucleotidases are widely distributed throughout all kingdoms of life and found in different cellular locations. The well-studied vertebrate 5'-nucleotidases play an important role in cellular metabolism. These enzymes are involved in purine and pyrimidine salvage pathways, nucleic acid repair, cell-to-cell communication, signal transduction, control of the ribo- and deoxyribonucleotide pools, etc. Although the first evidence of microbial 5'-nucleotidases was obtained almost 60 years ago, active studies of genetic control and the functions of microbial 5'-nucleotidases started relatively recently. The present review summarizes the current knowledge about microbial 5'-nucleotidases with a focus on their diversity, cellular localizations, molecular structures, mechanisms of catalysis, physiological roles, and activity regulation and approaches to identify new 5'-nucleotidases. The possible applications of these enzymes in biotechnology are also discussed.Key points• Microbial 5'-nucleotidases differ in molecular structure, hydrolytic mechanism, and cellular localization.• 5'-Nucleotidases play important and multifaceted roles in microbial cells.• Microbial 5'-nucleotidases have wide range of practical applications.	0
Title: Direct interaction of the mouse cytomegalovirus m152/gp40 immunoevasin with RAE-1 isoforms Abstract: Cytomegaloviruses (CMVs) are ubiquitous species-specific viruses that establish acute, persistent, and latent infections. Both human and mouse CMVs encode proteins that inhibit the activation of natural killer (NK) cells by downregulating cellular ligands for the NK cell activating receptor, NKG2D. The MCMV glycoprotein m152/gp40 downregulates the surface expression of RAE-1 to prevent NK cell control in vivo. So far, it is unclear if there is a direct interaction between m152 and RAE-1 and, if so, if m152 interacts differentially with the five identified RAE-1 isoforms, which are expressed as two groups in MCMV-susceptible or -resistant mouse strains. To address these questions, we expressed and purified the extracellular domains of RAE-1 and m152 and performed size exclusion chromatography binding assays as well as analytical ultracentrifugation and isothermal titration calorimetry to characterize these interactions quantitatively. We further evaluated the role of full-length and naturally glycosylated m152 and RAE-1 in cotransfected HEK293T cells. Our results confirmed that m152 binds RAE-1 directly, relatively tightly (K(d) < 5 microM), and with 1:1 stoichiometry. The binding is quantitatively different depending on particular RAE-1 isoforms, corresponding to the susceptibility to downregulation by m152. A PLWY motif found in RAE-1beta, although contributing to its affinity for m152, does not influence the affinity of RAE-1gamma or RAE-1delta, suggesting that other differences contribute to the RAE-1-m152 interaction. Molecular modeling of the different RAE-1 isoforms suggests a potential site for the m152 interaction.	0
Title: Direct Pathway Cloning (DiPaC) to unlock natural product biosynthetic potential Abstract: Specialized metabolites from bacteria are an important source of inspiration for drug development. The genes required for the biosynthesis of such metabolites in bacteria are usually organized in so-called biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs). Using modern bioinformatic tools, the wealth of genomic data can be scanned for such BGCs and the expected products can often structurally be predicted in silico. This facilitates the directed discovery of putatively novel bacterial metabolites. However, the production of these molecules often requires genetic manipulation of the BGC for activation or the expression of the pathway in a heterologous host. The latter necessitates the transplantation of the BGC into a suitable expression system. To achieve this goal, powerful cloning strategies based on in vivo homologous recombination have recently been developed. This includes LCHR and LLHR in E. coli as well as TAR cloning in yeast. Here, we present Direct Pathway Cloning (DiPaC) as an efficient complementary BGC capturing strategy that relies on long-amplicon PCR and in vitro DNA assembly. This straightforward approach facilitates full pathway assembly, BGC refactoring and direct transfer into any vector backbone in vitro. The broad applicability and efficiency of DiPaC is demonstrated by the discovery of a new phenazine from Serratia fonticola, the first heterologous production of anabaenopeptins from Nostoc punctiforme and the transfer of the native erythromycin BGC from Saccharopolyspora erythraea into Streptomyces. Due to its simplicity, we envisage DiPaC to become an essential method for BGC cloning and metabolic pathways construction with significant applications in metabolic engineering, synthetic biology and biotechnology.	1
Title: Microbial community composition and diversity in rice straw digestion bioreactors with and without dairy manure Abstract: Anaerobic digestion (AD) uses a range of substrates to generate biogas, including energy crops such as globally abundant rice straw (RS). Unfortunately, RS is high in lignocellulosic material and has high to C:N ratios (~80:1), which makes it (alone) a comparatively poor substrate for AD. Co-digestion with dairy manure (DM) has been promoted as a method for balancing C:N ratios to improve RS AD whilst also treating another farm waste and co-producing a potentially useful fertiliser. However, past co-digestion studies have not directly compared RS AD microbial communities with and without DM additions, which has made it hard to assess all impacts of DM addition to RS AD processes. Here, four RS:DM ratios were contrasted in identical semi-continuous-fed AD bioreactors, and 100% RS was found to produce the highest specific methane yields (112 mL CH4/g VS/day; VS, volatile solids), which is over double yields achieved in the reactor with the highest DM content (30:70 RS:DM by mass; 48 mL CH4/g VS/day). To underpin these data, microbial communities were sequenced and characterised across the four reactors. Dominant operational taxonomic units (OTUs) in the 100% RS unit were Bacteroidetes/Firmicutes, whereas the 30:70 RS:DM unit was dominated by Proteobacteria/Spirochaetes, suggesting major microbial community shifts occur with DM additions. However, community richness was lowest with 100% RS (despite higher specific yields), suggesting particular OTUs may be more important to yields than microbial diversity. Further, ambient VFA and VS levels were significantly higher when no DM was added, suggesting DM-amended reactors may cope better with higher organic loading rates (OLR). Results show that RS AD without DM addition is feasible, although co-digestion with DM will probably allow higher OLRs, resulting in great RS throughput in farm AD units.	0
Title: Biosynthesis of the salinosporamide A polyketide synthase substrate chloroethylmalonyl-coenzyme A from S-adenosyl-L-methionine Abstract: Polyketides are among the major classes of bioactive natural products used to treat microbial infections, cancer, and other diseases. Here we describe a pathway to chloroethylmalonyl-CoA as a polyketide synthase building block in the biosynthesis of salinosporamide A, a marine microbial metabolite whose chlorine atom is crucial for potent proteasome inhibition and anticancer activity. S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) is converted to 5'-chloro-5'-deoxyadenosine (5'-ClDA) in a reaction catalyzed by a SAM-dependent chlorinase as previously reported. By using a combination of gene deletions, biochemical analyses, and chemical complementation experiments with putative intermediates, we now provide evidence that 5'-ClDA is converted to chloroethylmalonyl-CoA in a 7-step route via the penultimate intermediate 4-chlorocrotonyl-CoA. Because halogenation often increases the bioactivity of drugs, the availability of a halogenated polyketide building block may be useful in molecular engineering approaches toward polyketide scaffolds.	1
