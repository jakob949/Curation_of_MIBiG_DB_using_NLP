Title: An environmental DNA-derived type II polyketide biosynthetic pathway encodes the biosynthesis of the pentacyclic polyketide erdacin Abstract: Environmental DNA-derived cosmid clones containing type II polyketide synthase genes were screened for the ability to produce clone-specific metabolites in Streptomyces. One of the Streptomyces recombinants produces erdacin, a novel polyketide with a previously unknown pentacyclic skeleton. Erdacin provides tangible evidence that environmental DNA gene clusters are likely to encode the biosynthesis of molecules that are substantively different from those that have been identified using culture-based strategies.	1
Title: Genome mining in streptomyces. Discovery of an unprecedented P450-catalyzed oxidative rearrangement that is the final step in the biosynthesis of pentalenolactone Abstract: The penM and pntM genes from the pentalenolactone biosynthetic gene clusters of Streptomyces exfoliatus UC5319 and Streptomyces arenae TÜ469 were predicted to encode orthologous cytochrome P450s, CYP161C3 and CYP161C2, responsible for the final step in the biosynthesis of the sesquiterpenoid antibiotic pentalenolactone (1). Synthetic genes optimized for expression in Escherichia coli were used to obtain recombinant PenM and PntM, each carrying an N-terminal His(6)-tag. Both proteins showed typical reduced-CO UV maxima at 450 nm, and each bound the predicted substrate, pentalenolactone F (4), with K(D) values of 153 ± 14 and 126 ± 11 μM for PenM and PntM, respectively, as determined by UV shift titrations. PenM and PntM both catalyzed the oxidative rearrangement of 4 to 1 when incubated in the presence of NADPH, spinach ferredoxin, ferredoxin reductase, and O(2). The steady-state kinetic parameters were k(cat) = 10.5 ± 1.7 min(-1) and K(m) = 340 ± 100 μM 4 for PenM and k(cat) = 8.8 ± 0.9 min(-1) and K(m) = 430 ± 100 μM 4 for PntM. The in vivo function of both gene products was confirmed by the finding that the corresponding deletion mutants S. exfoliatus/ΔpenM ZD22 and S. arenae/ΔpntM ZD23 no longer produced pentalenolactone but accumulated the precursor pentalenolactone F. Complementation of each deletion mutant with either penM or pntM restored production of antibiotic 1. Pentalenolactone was also produced by an engineered strain of Streptomyces avermitilis that had been complemented with pntE, pntD, and either pntM or penM, as well as the S. avermitilis electron-transport genes for ferredoxin and ferrodoxin reductase, fdxD and fprD.	1
Title: Non-invasive and in situ characterization of the degradation of biomaterial scaffolds by volumetric photoacoustic microscopy Abstract: Degradation is among the most important properties of biomaterial scaffolds, which are indispensable for regenerative medicine. The currently used method relies on the measurement of mass loss across different samples and cannot track the degradation of an individual scaffold in situ. Here we report, for the first time, the use of multiscale photoacoustic microscopy to non-invasively monitor the degradation of an individual scaffold. We could observe alterations to the morphology and structure of a scaffold at high spatial resolution and deep penetration, and more significantly, quantify the degradation of an individual scaffold as a function of time, both in vitro and in vivo. In addition, the remodeling of vasculature inside a scaffold can be visualized simultaneously using a dual-wavelength scanning mode in a label-free manner. This optoacoustic method can be used to monitor the degradation of individual scaffolds, offering a new approach to non-invasively analyze and quantify biomaterial-tissue interactions in conjunction with the assessment of in vivo vascular parameters.	0
Title: Effect of remediation reagents on bacterial composition and ecological function in black-odorous water sediments Abstract: Black-odorous urban water bodies and sediments pose a serious environmental problem. In this study, we conducted microcosm batch experiments to investigate the effect of remediation reagents (magnesium hydroxide and calcium nitrate) on native bacterial communities and their ecological functions in the black-odorous sediment of urban water. The dominant phyla (Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Chloroflexi, and Planctomycetes) and classes (Alphaproteobacteria, Betaproteobacteria, and Gammaproteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Anaerolineae, and Planctomycetia) were determined under calcium nitrate and magnesium hydroxide treatments. Functional groups related to aerobic metabolism, including aerobic chemoheterotrophy, dark sulfide oxidation, and correlated dominant genera (Thiobacillus, Lysobacter, Gp16, and Gaiella) became more abundant under calcium nitrate treatment, whereas functional genes potentially involved in dissimilatory sulfate reduction became less abundant. The relative abundance of chloroplasts, fermentation, and correlated genera (Desulfomonile and unclassified Cyanobacteria) decreased under magnesium hydroxide treatment. Overall, these results indicated that calcium nitrate addition improved hypoxia-related reducing conditions in the sediment and promoted aerobic chemoheterotrophy.	0
Title: Cloning, sequencing and characterization of the biosynthetic gene cluster of sanglifehrin A, a potent cyclophilin inhibitor Abstract: Sanglifehrin A (SFA), a potent cyclophilin inhibitor produced by Streptomyces flaveolus DSM 9954, bears a unique [5.5] spirolactam moiety conjugated with a 22-membered, highly functionalized macrolide through a linear carbon chain. SFA displays a diverse range of biological activities and offers significant therapeutic potential. However, the structural complexity of SFA poses a tremendous challenge for new analogue development via chemical synthesis. Based on a rational prediction of its biosynthetic origin, herein we report the cloning, sequencing and characterization of the gene cluster responsible for SFA biosynthesis. Analysis of the 92 776 bp contiguous DNA region reveals a mixed polyketide synthase (PKS)/non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) pathway which includes a variety of unique features for unusual PKS and NRPS building block formation. Our findings suggest that SFA biosynthesis requires a crotonyl-CoA reductase/carboxylase (CCR) for generation of the putative unusual PKS starter unit (2R)-2-ethylmalonamyl-CoA, an iterative type I PKS for the putative atypical extender unit (2S)-2-(2-oxo-butyl)malonyl-CoA and a phenylalanine hydroxylase for the NRPS extender unit (2S)-m-tyrosine. A spontaneous ketalization of significant note, may trigger spirolactam formation in a stereo-selective manner. This study provides a framework for the application of combinatorial biosynthesis methods in order to expand the structural diversity of SFA.	1
Title: Genetic variation at the O-antigen biosynthetic locus in Pseudomonas aeruginosa Abstract: The outer carbohydrate layer, or O antigen, of Pseudomonas aeruginosa varies markedly in different isolates of these bacteria, and at least 20 distinct O-antigen serotypes have been described. Previous studies have indicated that the major enzymes responsible for O-antigen synthesis are encoded in a cluster of genes that occupy a common genetic locus. We used targeted yeast recombinational cloning to isolate this locus from the 20 internationally recognized serotype strains. DNA sequencing of these isolated segments revealed that at least 11 highly divergent gene clusters occupy this region. Homology searches of the encoded protein products indicated that these gene clusters are likely to direct O-antigen biosynthesis. The O15 serotype strains lack functional gene clusters in the region analyzed, suggesting that O-antigen biosynthesis genes for this serotype are harbored in a different portion of the genome. The overall pattern underscores the plasticity of the P. aeruginosa genome, in which a specific site in a well-conserved genomic region can be occupied by any of numerous islands of functionally related DNA with diverse sequences.	1
Title: A novel method to produce armored double-stranded DNA by encapsulation of MS2 viral capsids Abstract: With the rapid development of molecular diagnostic techniques, there is a growing need for quality controls and standards with favorable properties to monitor the entire detection process. In this study, we describe a novel method to produce armored hepatitis B virus (HBV) and human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA for use in nucleic acid tests, which was confirmed to be stable, homogeneous, noninfectious, nuclease resistant, and safe for shipping. We demonstrated that MS2 bacteriophage could successfully package double-stranded DNA of 1.3-, 3-, 3.5-, and 6.5-kb length into viral capsids with high reassembly efficiency. This is the first application of RNA bacteriophage MS2 as a platform to encapsulate double-stranded DNA, forming virus-like particles (VLPs) which were indistinguishable from native MS2 capsids in size and morphology. Moreover, by analyzing the interaction mechanism of pac site and the MS2 coat protein (CP), we found that in addition to the recognized initiation signal TR-RNA, TR-DNA can also trigger spontaneous reassembly of CP dimers, providing a more convenient and feasible method of assembly. In conclusion, this straightforward and reliable manufacturing approach makes armored DNA an ideal control and standard for use in clinical laboratory tests and diagnostics, possessing prospects for broad application, especially providing a new platform for the production of quality controls for DNA viruses.	0
Title: HSF1-dependent upregulation of Hsp70 by sulfhydryl-reactive inducers of the KEAP1/NRF2/ARE pathway Abstract: The KEAP1/NRF2/ARE pathway and the heat shock response are inducible cytoprotective systems regulated by transcription factors NRF2 and HSF1, respectively. We report that structurally distinct small molecule NRF2 activators, all of which react with sulfhydryl groups but differ in potency by 15,000-fold, upregulate Hsp70, a prototypic HSF1-dependent gene. Hsp70 upregulation requires HSF1 but is NRF2 independent. We further demonstrate that a sulfoxythiocarbamate inducer conjugates to the negative regulator of HSF1, Hsp90. The differential concentration dependence of the two responses suggests that activation of NRF2 precedes that of HSF1: the KEAP1/NRF2/ARE pathway is at the forefront of cellular defense, protecting against instant danger; the heat shock response closely follows to resolve subsequent potentially devastating damage, saving the proteome. This uncovered duality undoubtedly contributes to the cytoprotective effects of such molecules in models of carcinogenesis, cardiovascular disease, and neurodegeneration.	0
Title: Identification of a poly-cyclopropylglycine-containing peptide via bioinformatic mapping of radical S-adenosylmethionine enzymes Abstract: Peptide-derived natural products are a large class of bioactive molecules that often contain chemically challenging modifications. In the biosynthesis of ribosomally synthesized and posttranslationally modified peptides (RiPPs), radical-SAM (rSAM) enzymes have been shown to catalyze the formation of ether, thioether, and carbon-carbon bonds on the precursor peptide. The installation of these bonds typically establishes the skeleton of the mature RiPP. To facilitate the search for unexplored rSAM-dependent RiPPs for the community, we employed a bioinformatic strategy to screen a subfamily of peptide-modifying rSAM enzymes which are known to bind up to three [4Fe-4S] clusters. A sequence similarity network was used to partition related families of rSAM enzymes into >250 clusters. Using representative sequences, genome neighborhood diagrams were generated using the Genome Neighborhood Tool. Manual inspection of bacterial genomes yielded numerous putative rSAM-dependent RiPP pathways with unique features. From this analysis, we identified and experimentally characterized the rSAM enzyme, TvgB, from the tvg gene cluster from Halomonas anticariensis. In the tvg gene cluster, the precursor peptide, TvgA, is comprised of a repeating TVGG motif. Structural characterization of the TvgB product revealed the repeated formation of cyclopropylglycine, where a new bond is formed between the γ-carbons on the precursor valine. This novel RiPP modification broadens the functional potential of rSAM enzymes and validates the proposed bioinformatic approach as a practical broad search tool for the discovery of new RiPP topologies.	1
Title: Licochalcone A Selectively Resensitizes ABCG2-Overexpressing Multidrug-Resistant Cancer Cells to Chemotherapeutic Drugs Abstract: The overexpression of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter ABCG2 has been linked to clinical multidrug resistance in solid tumors and blood cancers, which remains a significant obstacle to successful cancer chemotherapy. For years, the potential modulatory effect of bioactive compounds derived from natural sources on ABCG2-mediated multidrug resistance has been investigated, as they are inherently well tolerated and offer a broad range of chemical scaffolds. Licochalcone A (LCA), a natural chalcone isolated from the root of Glycyrrhiza inflata, is known to possess a broad spectrum of biological and pharmacological activities, including pro-apoptotic and antiproliferative effects in various cancer cell lines. In this study, the chemosensitization effect of LCA was examined in ABCG2-overexpressing multidrug-resistant cancer cells. Experimental data demonstrated that LCA inhibits the drug transport function of ABCG2 and reverses ABCG2-mediated multidrug resistance in human multidrug-resistant cancer cell lines in a concentration-dependent manner. Results of LCA-stimulated ABCG2 ATPase activity and the in silico docking analysis of LCA to the inward-open conformation of human ABCG2 suggest that LCA binds ABCG2 in the transmembrane substrate-binding pocket. This study provides evidence that LCA should be further evaluated as a modulator of ABCG2 in drug combination therapy trials against ABCG2-expressing drug-resistant tumors.	0
Title: Bacillibactins E and F from a Marine Sponge-Associated Bacillus sp Abstract: Chemical investigation of a marine sponge-associated Bacillus sp. led to the discovery of bacillibactins E and F (1 and 2). Despite containing the well-established cyclic triester core of iron-binding natural products such as enterobactin, bacillibactins E and F (1 and 2) are the first bacterial siderophores that contain nicotinic and benzoic acid moieties. The structures of the new compounds, including their absolute configurations, were determined by extensive spectroscopic analyses and Marfey's method. A plausible biosynthetic pathway to 1 and 2 is proposed; this route bears great similarity to other previously established bacillibactin-like pathways but appears to differentiate itself by a promiscuous DhbE, which likely installs the nicotinic moiety of 1 and the benzoic acid group of 2.	1
Title: The biosynthetic gene cluster for the polyketide immunosuppressant rapamycin Abstract: The macrocyclic polyketides rapamycin and FK506 are potent immunosuppressants that prevent T-cell proliferation through specific binding to intracellular protein receptors (immunophilins). The cloning and specific alteration of the biosynthetic genes for these polyketides might allow the biosynthesis of clinically valuable analogues. We report here that three clustered polyketide synthase genes responsible for rapamycin biosynthesis in Streptomyces hygroscopicus together encode 14 homologous sets of enzyme activities (modules), each catalyzing a specific round of chain elongation. An adjacent gene encodes a pipecolate-incorporating enzyme, which completes the macrocycle. The total of 70 constituent active sites makes this the most complex multienzyme system identified so far. The DNA region sequenced (107.3 kbp) contains 24 additional open reading frames, some of which code for proteins governing other key steps in rapamycin biosynthesis.	1
Title: Nostopeptolide plays a governing role during cellular differentiation of the symbiotic cyanobacterium Nostoc punctiforme Abstract: Nostoc punctiforme is a versatile cyanobacterium that can live either independently or in symbiosis with plants from distinct taxa. Chemical cues from plants and N. punctiforme were shown to stimulate or repress, respectively, the differentiation of infectious motile filaments known as hormogonia. We have used a polyketide synthase mutant that accumulates an elevated amount of hormogonia as a tool to understand the effect of secondary metabolites on cellular differentiation of N. punctiforme. Applying MALDI imaging to illustrate the reprogramming of the secondary metabolome, nostopeptolides were identified as the predominant difference in the pks2(-) mutant secretome. Subsequent differentiation assays and visualization of cell-type-specific expression of nostopeptolides via a transcriptional reporter strain provided evidence for a multifaceted role of nostopeptolides, either as an autogenic hormogonium-repressing factor or as a chemoattractant, depending on its extracellular concentration. Although nostopeptolide is constitutively expressed in the free-living state, secreted levels dynamically change before, during, and after the hormogonium differentiation phase. The metabolite was found to be strictly down-regulated in symbiosis with Gunnera manicata and Blasia pusilla, whereas other metabolites are up-regulated, as demonstrated via MALDI imaging, suggesting plants modulate the fine-balanced cross-talk network of secondary metabolites within N. punctiforme.	1

Hsp70 upregulation requires HSF1 but is NRF2 independent. We further demonstrate that a sulfoxythiocarbamate inducer conjugates to the negative regulator of HSF1, Hsp90. The differential concentration dependence of the two responses suggests that activation of NRF2 precedes that of HSF1: the KEAP1/NRF2/ARE pathway is at the forefront of cellular defense, protecting against instant danger; the heat shock response closely follows to resolve subsequent potentially devastating damage, saving the proteome. This uncovered duality undoubtedly contributes to the cytoprotective effects of such molecules in models of carcinogenesis, cardiovascular disease, and neurodegeneration.	0
Title: Biosynthesis of the sesquiterpene antibiotic albaflavenone in Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) Abstract: Cytochrome P450 170A1 (CYP170A1) is encoded by the sco5223 gene of the Gram-positive, soil-dwelling bacterium Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) as part of a two-gene cluster with the sco5222 gene. The SCO5222 protein is a sesquiterpene synthase that catalyzes the cyclization of farnesyl diphosphate to the novel tricyclic hydrocarbon, epi-isozizaene (Lin, X., Hopson, R., and Cane, D. E. (2006) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 128, 6022-6023). The presence of CYP170A1 (sco5223) suggested that epiisozizaene might be further oxidized by the transcriptionally coupled P450. We have now established that purified CYP170A1 carries out two sequential allylic oxidations to convert epi-isozizaene to an epimeric mixture of albaflavenols and thence to the sesquiterpene antibiotic albaflavenone. Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry analysis of S. coelicolor culture extracts established the presence of albaflavenone in the wild-type strain, along with its precursors epi-isozizaene and the albaflavenols. Disruption of the CYP170A1 gene abolished biosynthesis of both albaflavenone and the albaflavenols, but not epi-isozizaene. The combined results establish for the first time the presence of albaflavenone in S. coelicolor and clearly demonstrate that the biosynthesis of this antibiotic involves the coupled action of epi-isozizaene synthase and CYP170A1.	1
Title: Allenyl and alkynyl phenyl ethers from the endolichenic fungus Neurospora terricola Abstract: Terricollenes A-C (1-3), new allenyl phenyl ethers, and terricolynes (4-6), new alkynyl phenyl ethers, have been isolated from the crude extract of the endolichenic fungus Neurospora terricola. The structures of these compounds were elucidated primarily by NMR experiments. The absolute configurations of 1 and 2 were determined by reversed-phase HPLC analysis on the o-tolylthiocarbamates of the liberated sugars upon acid hydrolysis, whereas that of 4 was assigned using the modified Mosher method. Compound 1 showed modest cytotoxicity against the human tumor cell lines HeLa and MCF-7.	0
Title: Point-of-Care Analyte Quantification and Digital Readout via Lysate-Based Cell-Free Biosensors Interfaced with Personal Glucose Monitors Abstract: Field-deployable diagnostics based on cell-free systems have advanced greatly, but on-site quantification of target analytes remains a challenge. Here we demonstrate that Escherichia coli lysate-based cell-free biosensors coupled to a personal glucose monitor (PGM) can enable on-site analyte quantification, with the potential for straightforward reconfigurability to diverse types of analytes. We show that analyte-responsive regulators of transcription and translation can modulate the production of the reporter enzyme β-galactosidase, which in turn converts lactose into glucose for PGM quantification. Because glycolysis is active in the lysate and would readily deplete converted glucose, we decoupled enzyme production and glucose conversion to increase the end point signal output. However, this lysate metabolism did allow for one-pot removal of glucose present in complex samples (like human serum) without confounding target quantification. Taken together, our results show that integrating lysate-based cell-free biosensors with PGMs enables accessible target detection and quantification at the point of need.	0
Title: Biochemical and structural insights of the early glycosylation steps in calicheamicin biosynthesis Abstract: The enediyne antibiotic calicheamicin (CLM) gamma(1)(I) is a prominent antitumor agent that is targeted to DNA by a novel aryltetrasaccharide comprised of an aromatic unit and four unusual carbohydrates. Herein we report the heterologous expression and the biochemical characterization of the two "internal" glycosyltransferases CalG3 and CalG2 and the structural elucidation of an enediyne glycosyltransferase (CalG3). In conjunction with the previous characterization of the "external" CLM GTs CalG1 and CalG4, this study completes the functional assignment of all four CLM GTs, extends the utility of enediyne GT-catalyzed reaction reversibility, and presents conclusive evidence of a sequential glycosylation pathway in CLM biosynthesis. This work also reveals the common GT-B structural fold can now be extended to include enediyne GTs.	0
Title: Production of optically pure D-lactic acid in mineral salts medium by metabolically engineered Escherichia coli W3110 Abstract: The resistance of polylactide to biodegradation and the physical properties of this polymer can be controlled by adjusting the ratio of L-lactic acid to D-lactic acid. Although the largest demand is for the L enantiomer, substantial amounts of both enantiomers are required for bioplastics. We constructed derivatives of Escherichia coli W3110 (prototrophic) as new biocatalysts for the production of D-lactic acid. These strains (SZ40, SZ58, and SZ63) require only mineral salts as nutrients and lack all plasmids and antibiotic resistance genes used during construction. D-Lactic acid production by these new strains approached the theoretical maximum yield of two molecules per glucose molecule. The chemical purity of this D-lactic acid was approximately 98% with respect to soluble organic compounds. The optical purity exceeded 99%. Competing pathways were eliminated by chromosomal inactivation of genes encoding fumarate reductase (frdABCD), alcohol/aldehyde dehydrogenase (adhE), and pyruvate formate lyase (pflB). The cell yield and lactate productivity were increased by a further mutation in the acetate kinase gene (ackA). Similar improvements could be achieved by addition of 10 mM acetate or by an initial period of aeration. All three approaches reduced the time required to complete the fermentation of 5% glucose. The use of mineral salts medium, the lack of antibiotic resistance genes or plasmids, the high yield of D-lactate, and the high product purity should reduce costs associated with nutrients, purification, containment, biological oxygen demand, and waste treatment.	0
Title: Functions of the Clostridium acetobutylicium FabF and FabZ proteins in unsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis Abstract: Background:                       The original anaerobic unsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis pathway proposed by Goldfine and Bloch was based on in vivo labeling studies in Clostridium butyricum ATCC 6015 (now C. beijerinckii) but to date no dedicated unsaturated fatty acid biosynthetic enzyme has been identified in Clostridia. C. acetobutylicium synthesizes the same species of unsaturated fatty acids as E. coli, but lacks all of the known unsaturated fatty acid synthetic genes identified in E. coli and other bacteria. A possible explanation was that two enzymes of saturated fatty acid synthesis of C. acetobutylicium, FabZ and FabF might also function in the unsaturated arm of the pathway (a FabZ homologue is known to be an unsaturated fatty acid synthetic enzyme in enterococci).                  Results:                       We report that the FabF homologue located within the fatty acid biosynthetic gene cluster of C. acetobutylicium functions in synthesis of both unsaturated fatty acids and saturated fatty acids. Expression of this protein in E. coli functionally replaced both the FabB and FabF proteins of the host in vivo and replaced E. coli FabB in a defined in vitro fatty acid synthesis system. In contrast the single C. acetobutylicium FabZ homologue, although able to functionally replace E. coli FabZ in vivo and in vitro, was unable to replace FabA, the key dehydratase-isomerase of E. coli unsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis in vivo and lacked isomerase activity in vitro.                  Conclusion:                       Thus, C. acetobutylicium introduces the double of unsaturated fatty acids by use of a novel and unknown enzyme.	0
Title: Mitochondrial D-loop sequences are integrated in the rat nuclear genome Abstract: We have cloned two fragments of rat nuclear DNA (nucDNA), 3.3 x 10(3) nucleotide-pairs (knp) and 9.1 knp, that contain a 0.5 knp section sharing 80% sequence identity with the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) heavy strand origin of replication (D-loop) nascent strand and 88% identity with each other. The light and heavy strand promoters of the D-loop region are not present in either clone, thus they likely do not function as replication origins in the nuclear genome. The nucDNA sequences surrounding the mtDNA-like sequences are not mitochondrial, thus the mtDNA-like sequences are demonstrably covalently linked in the nuclear genome. Indeed, the surrounding nuclear sequences of each clone also share 88% identity. This sequence arrangement strongly suggests an initial insertion of mtDNA into nucDNA with subsequent amplification of an encompassing region of nucDNA. Divergence calculations suggest that the mtDNA insertion occurred around 13.6 million years ago (MYA) with the subsequent separation occurring around 6.5 MYA. The mtDNA-like sequences of the nuclear clones hybridize strongly to a number of different BamHI-PstI restriction fragments, suggesting either repeated integration and/or frequent mutational events producing new restriction enzyme sites. It is not yet known if one or more of the uncloned D-loop-like sequences are associated with promoters, which would suggest possible function. The 3.3 knp nucDNA fragment is present in low copy number. In contrast, the 9.1 knp nucDNA fragment appears to be moderately repeated. The elements do not appear to be tandemly repeated. The nucDNA clones contain remnants of rat long interspersed repetitive element (LINE) sequences; in addition the 9.1 knp fragment contains sequences with similarity to portions of viral reverse transcriptase and RNaseH genes. Until now, all mtDNA-like sequences found in the nuclear genome have been coding sequences. This is the first confirmation by sequence analysis of a portion of the mtDNA control region in the nuclear genome.	0
Title: Epigenetics of Epileptogenesis-Evoked Upregulation of Matrix Metalloproteinase-9 in Hippocampus Abstract: Enhanced levels of Matrix Metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) have been implicated in the pathogenesis of epilepsy in humans and rodents. Lack of Mmp-9 impoverishes, whereas excess of Mmp-9 facilitates epileptogenesis. Epigenetic mechanisms driving the epileptogenesis-related upregulation of MMP-9 expression are virtually unknown. The aim of this study was to reveal these mechanisms. We analyzed hippocampi extracted from adult and pediatric patients with temporal lobe epilepsy as well as from partially and fully pentylenetetrazole kindled rats. We used a unique approach to the analysis of the kindling model results (inclusion in the analysis of rats being during kindling, and not only a group of fully kindled animals), which allowed us to separate the molecular effects exerted by the epileptogenesis from those related to epilepsy and epileptic activity. Consequently, it allowed for a disclosure of molecular mechanisms underlying causes, and not consequences, of epilepsy. Our data show that the epileptogenesis-evoked upregulation of Mmp-9 expression is regulated by removal from Mmp-9 gene proximal promoter of the two, interweaved potent silencing mechanisms-DNA methylation and Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2)-related repression. Demethylation depends on a gradual dissociation of the DNA methyltransferases, Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b, and on progressive association of the DNA demethylation promoting protein Gadd45β to Mmp-9 proximal gene promoter in vivo. The PRC2-related mechanism relies on dissociation of the repressive transcription factor YY1 and the dissipation of the PRC2-evoked trimethylation on Lys27 of the histone H3 from the proximal Mmp-9 promoter chromatin in vivo. Moreover, we show that the DNA hydroxymethylation, a new epigenetic DNA modification, which is localized predominantly in the gene promoters and is particularly abundant in the brain, is not involved in a regulation of MMP-9 expression during the epileptogenesis in the rat hippocampus as well as in the hippocampi of pediatric and adult epileptic patients. Additionally, we have also found that despite of its transient nature, the histone modification H3S10ph is strongly and gradually accumulated during epileptogenesis in the cell nuclei and in the proximal Mmp-9 gene promoter in the hippocampus, which suggests that H3S10ph can be involved in DNA demethylation in mammals, and not only in Neurospora. The study identifies MMP-9 as the first protein coding gene which expression is regulated by DNA methylation in human epilepsy. We present a detailed epigenetic model of the epileptogenesis-evoked upregulation of MMP-9 expression in the hippocampus. To our knowledge, it is the most complex and most detailed mechanism of epigenetic regulation of gene expression ever revealed for a particular gene in epileptogenesis. Our results also suggest for the first time that dysregulation of DNA methylation found in epilepsy is a cause rather than a consequence of this condition.	0
Title: Identification of genes necessary for jinggangmycin biosynthesis from Streptomyces hygroscopicus 10-22 Abstract: A series of large chromosomal deletions in Streptomyces hygroscopicus 10-22 were aligned on the physical map of the wild-type strain and the mutants were assessed for their ability to produce the aminocyclitol antibiotic 5102-I (jinggangmycin). Twenty-eight mutants were blocked for jinggangmycin production and all of them were found to lack a 300 kb AseI-F fragment of the wild-type chromosome. An ordered cosmid library of the 300 kb AseI-F fragment was made and one of the cosmids conferred jinggangmycin productivity to Streptomyces lividans ZX1. Three of the overlapping cosmids (18G7, 5H3 and 9A2) also hybridized to the valA gene of the validamycin pathway from S. hygroscopicus 5008 as a probe. This gene resembles acbC from Actinoplanes sp. 50/110, which encodes a C7-cyclitol synthase that catalyses the transformation of sedoheptulose 7-phosphate into 2-5-epi-valiolone for acarbose biosynthesis. The valA/acbC-homolog (orf1) of S. hygroscopicus 10-22 was shown to be essential for jinggangmycin biosynthesis as an engineered mutant with a specific in-frame deletion removing a 609 bp sequence internal to orf1 completely abolished jinggangmycin production and the corresponding knock-out mutant (JXH4) could be complemented for jinggangmycin production by the introduction of an orf1-containing construct. Concurrently, the identities of the genes common to S. hygroscopicus strains 10-22 and 5008 prompted a comparison of the chemical structures of jinggangmycin and validamycin, which led to a clear demonstration that they are identical.	1
Title: Anthranilate synthase subunit organization in Chromobacterium violaceum Abstract: Tryptophan is an aromatic amino acid used for protein synthesis and cellular growth. Chromobacterium violaceum ATCC 12472 uses two tryptophan molecules to synthesize violacein, a secondary metabolite of pharmacological interest. The genome analysis of this bacterium revealed that the genes trpA-F and pabA-B encode the enzymes of the tryptophan pathway in which the first reaction is the conversion of chorismate to anthranilate by anthranilate synthase (AS), an enzyme complex. In the present study, the organization and structure of AS protein subunits from C. violaceum were analyzed using bioinformatics tools available on the Web. We showed by calculating molecular masses that AS in C. violaceum is composed of alpha (TrpE) and beta (PabA) subunits. This is in agreement with values determined experimentally. Catalytic and regulatory sites of the AS subunits were identified. The TrpE and PabA subunits contribute to the catalytic site while the TrpE subunit is involved in the allosteric site. Protein models for the TrpE and PabA subunits were built by restraint-based homology modeling using AS enzyme, chains A and B, from Salmonella typhimurium (PDB ID 1I1Q).	1
Title: Chemical Protein Ubiquitylation with Preservation of the Native Cysteine Residues Abstract: We report a cysteine-based ligation strategy for generating a monoubiquitylated protein while preserving the native cysteine residues on the acceptor protein. In monoubiquitylation of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) this method circumvents the need to mutate the native cysteine residues on PCNA. The chemically ubiquitylated PCNA contains a noncleavable linkage of the same length as the native isopeptide linkage. It also retains the normal function of the native Ub-PCNA in stimulating the ATPase activity of replication factor C (RFC) and lesion bypass synthesis by Polη. This method may be adapted for chemical ubiquitylation of other proteins and for site-specific modification of a target protein at a specific site through sulfhydryl chemistry.	0
Title: TREM-1 links dyslipidemia to inflammation and lipid deposition in atherosclerosis Abstract: Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-1 (TREM-1) is a potent amplifier of pro-inflammatory innate immune responses, but its significance in non-infectious diseases remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that TREM-1 promotes cardiovascular disease by exacerbating atherosclerosis. TREM-1 is expressed in advanced human atheromas and is highly upregulated under dyslipidemic conditions on circulating and on lesion-infiltrating myeloid cells in the Apoe-/- mouse model. TREM-1 strongly contributes to high-fat, high-cholesterol diet (HFCD)-induced monocytosis and synergizes with HFCD serum-derived factors to promote pro-inflammatory cytokine responses and foam cell formation of human monocyte/macrophages. Trem1-/-Apoe-/- mice exhibit substantially attenuated diet-induced atherogenesis. In particular, our results identify skewed monocyte differentiation and enhanced lipid accumulation as novel mechanisms through which TREM-1 can promote atherosclerosis. Collectively, our findings illustrate that dyslipidemia induces TREM-1 surface expression on myeloid cells and subsequently synergizes with TREM-1 to enhance monopoiesis, pro-atherogenic cytokine production and foam cell formation.	0
Title: In vitro characterization of echinomycin biosynthesis: formation and hydroxylation of L-tryptophanyl-S-enzyme and oxidation of (2S,3S) β-hydroxytryptophan Abstract: Quinoxaline-2-carboxylic acid (QXC) and 3-hydroxyquinaldic acid (HQA) feature in quinomycin family and confer anticancer activity. In light of the significant potency against cancer, the biosynthetic gene clusters have been reported from many different Streptomyces strains, and the biosynthetic pathway were proposed mainly based on the in vivo feeding experiment with isotope labeled putative intermediates. Herein we report another gene cluster from Streptomyces griseovariabilis subsp. bandungensis subsp. nov responsible for the biosynthesis of echinomycin (a member of quinomycin family, also named quinomycin A) and presented in vitro evidence to corroborate the previous hypothesis on QXC biosynthesis, showing that only with the assistance of a MbtH-like protein Qui5, did the didomain NRPS protein (Qui18) perform the loading of a L-tryptophan onto its own PCP domain. Particularly, it was found that Qui5 and Qui18 subunits form a functional tetramer through size exclusion chromatography. The subsequent hydroxylation on β-carbon of the loaded L-tryptophan proved in vitro to be completed by cytochrome P450-dependent hydroxylase Qui15. Importantly, only the Qui18 loaded L-tryptophan can be hydroxylated by Qui15 and the enzyme was inactive on free L-tryptophan. Additionally, the chemically synthesized (2S,3S) β-hydroxytryptophan was detected to be converted by the tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase Qui17 through LC-MS, which enriched our previous knowledge that tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase nearly exclusively acted on L-tryptophan and 6-fluoro-tryptophan.	1
Title: Genetic localization and molecular characterization of the nonS gene required for macrotetrolide biosynthesis in Streptomyces griseus DSM40695 Abstract: The macrotetrolides are a family of cyclic polyethers derived from tetramerization, in a stereospecific fashion, of the enantiomeric nonactic acid (NA) and its homologs. Isotope labeling experiments established that NA is of polyketide origin, and biochemical investigations demonstrated that 2-methyl-6,8-dihydroxynon-2E-enoic acid can be converted into NA by a cell-free preparation from Streptomyces lividans that expresses nonS. These results lead to the hypothesis that macrotetrolide biosynthesis involves a pair of enantiospecific polyketide pathways. In this work, a 55-kb contiguous DNA region was cloned from Streptomyces griseus DSM40695, a 6.3-kb fragment of which was sequenced to reveal five open reading frames, including the previously reported nonR and nonS genes. Inactivation of nonS in vivo completely abolished macrotetrolide production. Complementation of the nonS mutant by the expression of nonS in trans fully restored its macrotetrolide production ability, with a distribution of individual macrotetrolides similar to that for the wild-type producer. In contrast, fermentation of the nonS mutant in the presence of exogenous (+/-)-NA resulted in the production of nonactin, monactin, and dinactin but not in the production of trinactin and tetranactin. These results prove the direct involvement of nonS in macrotetrolide biosynthesis. The difference in macrotetrolide production between in vivo complementation of the nonS mutant by the plasmid-borne nonS gene and fermentation of the nonS mutant in the presence of exogenously added (+/-)-NA suggests that NonS catalyzes the formation of (-)-NA and its homologs, supporting the existence of a pair of enantiospecific polyketide pathways for macrotetrolide biosynthesis in S. griseus. The latter should provide a model that can be used to study the mechanism by which polyketide synthase controls stereochemistry during polyketide biosynthesis.	1
Title: Effect of mixing on rifampin bactericidal activity against staphylococci Abstract: Minimal bactericidal concentrations of rifampin were significantly increased, and serum bactericidal activity from volunteers receiving this drug was significantly decreased by vigorous mixing of microtiter plates before sampling when tested against Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis at 10(5) and 10(6) colony-forming units per ml. These results suggest that microtiter estimates of the bactericidal activity of rifampin against staphylococci should be performed after vigorous shaking.	0
Title: Identification and characterization of mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase as a promising antiviral therapeutic target Abstract: The causative agent of COVID-19 is a novel betacoronavirus or severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), which has emerged as a pandemic of global concern. Considering its rapid transmission, WHO has declared public health emergency on 11th March 2020 worldwide. SARS-CoV-2 is a genetically diverse positive sense RNA virus that typically exhibit high rates of mutation than DNA viruses. Higher rates of mutation bring higher genomic variability which may lead to viral evolution and enabling viruses to evade the pre-existing immunity of host and quickly acquire drug resistance properties. The objective of our study was to compare the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp sequences of Indian SARS-CoV-2 isolates with those of Wuhan type virus. A total of 384 point mutations were detected from 488 sequence of the RdRp protein of Indian SARS-CoV-2 genome, out of which seven were used for subsequent study. Furthermore, prediction of secondary structure, protein modeling and its dynamics were performed which revealed that seven mutations (R118C, T148I, Y149C, E802A, Q822H, V880I and D893Y) significantly altered the stability and flexibility of RdRp protein. Present study was therefore, undertaken to analyze the variations occurring in RdRp due to multiple mutations leading to the alterations in the structure and function of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase which is essential for the replication /transcription of this virus and hence can be utilized as a promising therapeutic target to curb SARS-CoV-2 infections.	0
Title: Glycerol kinase, the pacemaker for the dissimilation of glycerol in Escherichia coli Abstract: The activity of glycerol kinase is rate-limiting in the metabolism of glycerol by cells of Escherichia coli. A mutant strain producing a glycerol kinase resistant to inhibition by fructose-1,6-diphosphate grows faster than its wild-type parent on glycerol as the sole source of carbon and energy. The amount of intracellular fructose-1,6-diphosphate was determined for wild-type cells growing exponentially on glycerol. The water content of such cells was also determined, allowing calculation of the intracellular concentration of fructose-1,6-diphosphate. This value, 1.7 mm, is adequate to exert substantial inhibition on the wild-type glycerol kinase. The desensitization of glycerol kinase to feedback inhibition also enhances the power of glycerol to exert catabolite repression, both on the enzymes of the glycerol system itself and on those of the lactose system. However, desensitization of glycerol kinase alone does not eliminate the phenomenon of diauxic growth in a glucose-glycerol medium. Biphasic growth in such a medium is abolished if the altered enzyme is produced constitutively. The constitutive production of the mutant kinase at high levels, however, renders the cells vulnerable to glycerol. Thus, when the cells have been grown on a carbon source with a low power for catabolite repression, e.g., succinate, sudden exposure to glycerol leads to overconsumption of the nutrient and cell death.	0
Title: Structure and biosynthesis of heat-stable antifungal factor (HSAF), a broad-spectrum antimycotic with a novel mode of action Abstract: A screen for antifungal compounds from Lysobacter enzymogenes strain C3, a bacterial biological control agent of fungal diseases, has previously led to the isolation of heat-stable antifungal factor (HSAF). HSAF exhibits inhibitory activities against a wide range of fungal species and shows a novel mode of antifungal action by disrupting the biosynthesis of a distinct group of sphingolipids. We have now determined the chemical structure of HSAF, which is identical to that of dihydromaltophilin, an antifungal metabolite with a unique macrocyclic lactam system containing a tetramic acid moiety and a 5,5,6-tricyclic skeleton. We have also identified the genetic locus responsible for the biosynthesis of HSAF in strain C3. DNA sequencing of this locus revealed genes for a hybrid polyketide synthase-nonribosomal peptide synthetase (PKS-NRPS), a sterol desaturase, a ferredoxin reductase, and an arginase. The disruption of the PKS-NRPS gene generated C3 mutants that lost the ability to produce HSAF and to inhibit fungal growth, demonstrating a hybrid PKS-NRPS that catalyzed the biosynthesis of the unique macrolactam system that is found in many biologically active natural products isolated from marine organisms. In addition, we have generated mutants with disrupted sterol desaturase, ferredoxin reductase, and arginase and examined the metabolites produced in these mutants. The work represents the first study of the genetic basis for the biosynthesis of the tetramic acid-containing macrolactams. The elucidation of the chemical structure of HSAF and the identification of the genetic locus for its biosynthesis establish the foundation for future exploitation of this group of compounds as new fungicides or antifungal drugs.	1
Title: Discovery of unusual dimeric piperazyl cyclopeptides encoded by a Lentzea flaviverrucosa DSM 44664 biosynthetic supercluster Abstract: Rare actinomycetes represent an underexploited source of new bioactive compounds. Here, we report the use of a targeted metabologenomic approach to identify piperazyl compounds in the rare actinomycete Lentzea flaviverrucosa DSM 44664. These efforts to identify molecules that incorporate piperazate building blocks resulted in the discovery and structural elucidation of two dimeric biaryl-cyclohexapeptides, petrichorins A and B. Petrichorin B is a symmetric homodimer similar to the known compound chloptosin, but petrichorin A is unique among known piperazyl cyclopeptides because it is an asymmetric heterodimer. Due to the structural complexity of petrichorin A, solving its structure required a combination of several standard chemical methods plus in silico modeling, strain mutagenesis, and solving the structure of its biosynthetic intermediate petrichorin C for confident assignment. Furthermore, we found that the piperazyl cyclopeptides comprising each half of the petrichorin A heterodimer are made via two distinct nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) assembly lines, and the responsible NRPS enzymes are encoded within a contiguous biosynthetic supercluster on the L. flaviverrucosa chromosome. Requiring promiscuous cytochrome p450 crosslinking events for asymmetric and symmetric biaryl production, petrichorins A and B exhibited potent in vitro activity against A2780 human ovarian cancer, HT1080 fibrosarcoma, PC3 human prostate cancer, and Jurkat human T lymphocyte cell lines with IC50 values at low nM levels. Cyclic piperazyl peptides and their crosslinked derivatives are interesting drug leads, and our findings highlight the potential for heterodimeric bicyclic peptides such as petrichorin A for inclusion in future pharmaceutical design and discovery programs.	1
Title: Identification and characterization of a putative ABC transporter PltHIJKN required for pyoluteorin production in Pseudomonas sp. M18 Abstract: A putative ABC (ATP-binding cassette) transport gene cluster pltHIJKN was identified and characterized within a 7.5-kb genome region downstream of the antibiotic pyoluteorin (Plt) biosynthetic gene cluster in Pseudomonas sp. M18, a rhizosphere bacterium which is of ecological importance for controlling plant diseases caused by soil-borne fungal pathogens. The sequence similarity, conserved domains and hydrophobicity profiles strongly suggest that the pltHIJKN gene products are integrated into a typical three-component ABC export system, which consists of the inner membrane ABC transporter PltIJK, the membrane fusion protein PltH and the outer membrane efflux protein PltN. Mutant strains of M18 defective in pltH or pltI did not produce detectable levels of Plt. Overexpression of the entire pltHIJKN gene cluster resulted in a significant increase of Plt production. Heterogenous expression of the pltHIJKN gene cluster gave rise to a significant enhancement of resistance of E. coli DH5alpha to exogenous Plt. These results indicate that PltHIJKN is required for Plt biosynthesis and resistance, which is likely to be mediated by Plt export using the PltHIJKN transport system. Exogenous Plt induced the expression of both the Plt biosynthetic gene cluster and the ABC transport gene cluster pltHIJKN at the transcriptional level, suggesting that Plt biosynthesis and expression of pltHIJKN are coordinately and similarly regulated in Pseudomonas sp. M18.	1
Title: An extracellular siderophore is required to maintain the mutualistic interaction of Epichloë festucae with Lolium perenne Abstract: We have identified from the mutualistic grass endophyte Epichloë festucae a non-ribosomal peptide synthetase gene (sidN) encoding a siderophore synthetase. The enzymatic product of SidN is shown to be a novel extracellular siderophore designated as epichloënin A, related to ferrirubin from the ferrichrome family. Targeted gene disruption of sidN eliminated biosynthesis of epichloënin A in vitro and in planta. During iron-depleted axenic growth, ΔsidN mutants accumulated the pathway intermediate N(5)-trans-anhydromevalonyl-N(5)-hydroxyornithine (trans-AMHO), displayed sensitivity to oxidative stress and showed deficiencies in both polarized hyphal growth and sporulation. Infection of Lolium perenne (perennial ryegrass) with ΔsidN mutants resulted in perturbations of the endophyte-grass symbioses. Deviations from the characteristic tightly regulated synchronous growth of the fungus with its plant partner were observed and infected plants were stunted. Analysis of these plants by light and transmission electron microscopy revealed abnormalities in the distribution and localization of ΔsidN mutant hyphae as well as deformities in hyphal ultrastructure. We hypothesize that lack of epichloënin A alters iron homeostasis of the symbiotum, changing it from mutually beneficial to antagonistic. Iron itself or epichloënin A may serve as an important molecular/cellular signal for controlling fungal growth and hence the symbiotic interaction.	1
Title: Biosynthesis of the Novel Macrolide Antibiotic Anthracimycin Abstract: We report the identification of the biosynthetic gene cluster for the unusual antibiotic anthracimycin (atc) from the marine derived producer strain Streptomyces sp. T676 isolated off St. John's Island, Singapore. The 53 253 bps atc locus includes a trans-acyltransferase (trans-AT) polyketide synthase (PKS), and heterologous expression in Streptomyces coelicolor resulted in anthracimycin production. Analysis of the atc cluster revealed that anthracimycin is likely generated by four PKS gene products AtcC-AtcF without involvement of post-PKS tailoring enzymes, and a biosynthetic pathway is proposed. The availability of the atc cluster provides a basis for investigating the biosynthesis of anthracimycin and its subsequent bioengineering to provide novel analogues with improved pharmacological properties.	1
Title: Convergent evolution of adenosine aptamers spanning bacterial, human, and random sequences revealed by structure-based bioinformatics and genomic SELEX Abstract: Aptamers are structured macromolecules in vitro evolved to bind molecular targets, whereas in nature they form the ligand-binding domains of riboswitches. Adenosine aptamers of a single structural family were isolated several times from random pools, but they have not been identified in genomic sequences. We used two unbiased methods, structure-based bioinformatics and human genome-based in vitro selection, to identify aptamers that form the same adenosine-binding structure in a bacterium, and several vertebrates, including humans. Two of the human aptamers map to introns of RAB3C and FGD3 genes. The RAB3C aptamer binds ATP with dissociation constants about 10 times lower than physiological ATP concentration, while the minimal FGD3 aptamer binds ATP only cotranscriptionally.	0
Title: Engineering Pseudochelin Production in Myxococcus xanthus Abstract: Myxobacteria utilize the catechol natural products myxochelin A and B in order to maintain their iron homeostasis. Recently, the production of these siderophores, along with a new myxochelin derivative named pseudochelin A, was reported for the marine bacterium Pseudoalteromonas piscicida S2040. The latter derivative features a characteristic imidazoline moiety, which was proposed to originate from an intramolecular condensation reaction of the β-aminoethyl amide group in myxochelin B. To identify the enzyme catalyzing this conversion, we compared the myxochelin regulons of two myxobacterial strains that produce solely myxochelin A and B with those of P. piscicida S2040. This approach revealed a gene exclusive to the myxochelin regulon in P. piscicida S2040, coding for an enzyme of the amidohydrolase superfamily. To prove that this enzyme is indeed responsible for the postulated conversion, the reaction was reconstituted in vitro using a hexahistidine-tagged recombinant protein made in Escherichia coli, with myxochelin B as the substrate. To test the production of pseudochelin A under in vivo conditions, the amidohydrolase gene was cloned into the myxobacterial plasmid pZJY156 and placed under the control of a copper-inducible promoter. The resulting vector was introduced into the myxobacterium Myxococcus xanthus DSM 16526, a native producer of myxochelin A and B. Following induction with copper, the myxobacterial expression strain was found to synthesize small quantities of pseudochelin A. Replacement of the copper-inducible promoter with the constitutive pilA promoter led to increased production levels in M. xanthus, which facilitated the isolation and subsequent structural verification of the heterologously produced compound.IMPORTANCE In this study, an enzyme for imidazoline formation in pseudochelin biosynthesis was identified. Evidence for the involvement of this enzyme in the postulated reaction was obtained after in vitro reconstitution. Furthermore, the function of this enzyme was demonstrated in vivo by transferring the corresponding gene into the bacterium Myxococcus xanthus, which thereby became a producer of pseudochelin A. In addition to clarifying the molecular basis of imidazoline formation in siderophore biosynthesis, we describe the heterologous expression of a gene in a myxobacterium without chromosomal integration. Due to its metabolic proficiency, M. xanthus represents an interesting alternative to established host systems for the reconstitution and manipulation of biosynthetic pathways. Since the plasmid used in this study is easily adaptable for the expression of other enzymes as well, we expand the conventional expression strategy for myxobacteria, which is based on the integration of biosynthetic genes into the host genome.	1
Title: Zelkovamycins B-E, Cyclic Octapeptides Containing Rare Amino Acid Residues from an Endophytic Kitasatospora sp Abstract: Four unusual cyclopeptides, zelkovamycins B-E (1-4), were isolated from an endophytic Kitasatospora sp. Zelkovamycin B was featured by an unprecedented 3-methyl-5-hydroxypyrrolidine-2,4-dione ring system linked to the cyclopeptide skeleton. Their structures and full configurations were established by spectroscopic analysis, Marfey's method, and NMR calculations. A plausible biosynthetic pathway for zelkovamycins was proposed based on gene cluster analysis. Zelkovamycin E displayed potent inhibitory activity against H1N1 influenza A virus.	1
Title: Chromatin-level regulation of biosynthetic gene clusters Abstract: Loss-of-function Aspergillus nidulans CclA, a Bre2 ortholog involved in histone H3 lysine 4 methylation, activated the expression of cryptic secondary metabolite clusters in A. nidulans. One new cluster generated monodictyphenone, emodin and emodin derivatives, whereas a second encoded two anti-osteoporosis polyketides, F9775A and F9775B. Modification of the chromatin landscape in fungal secondary metabolite clusters allows for a simple technological means to express silent fungal secondary metabolite gene clusters.	1
Title: An anaerobic bacterium host system for heterologous expression of natural product biosynthetic gene clusters Abstract: Anaerobic bacteria represent an overlooked rich source of biological and chemical diversity. Due to the challenge of cultivation and genetic intractability, assessing the capability of their biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) for secondary metabolite production requires an efficient heterologous expression system. However, this kind of host system is still unavailable. Here, we use the facultative anaerobe Streptococcus mutans UA159 as a heterologous host for the expression of BGCs from anaerobic bacteria. A natural competence based large DNA fragment cloning (NabLC) technique was developed, which can move DNA fragments up to 40-kb directly and integrate a 73.7-kb BGC to the genome of S. mutans UA159 via three rounds of NabLC cloning. Using this system, we identify an anti-infiltration compound, mutanocyclin, from undefined BGCs from human oral bacteria. We anticipate this host system will be useful for heterologous expression of BGCs from anaerobic bacteria.	1
Title: Production of a Novel Amide-Containing Polyene by Activating a Cryptic Biosynthetic Gene Cluster in Streptomyces sp. MSC090213JE08 Abstract: Streptomyces sp. MSC090213JE08 seems to have more than 20 cryptic biosynthetic gene clusters for secondary metabolites. We aimed to activate some of them by forced production of Streptomyces antibiotic regulatory protein (SARP) family transcriptional activators. We constructed seven recombinant strains, each of which contained a SARP gene under the control of a constitutive promoter, and subjected them to comparative metabolic profiling analysis. Four of the seven strains produced nine metabolites that were hardly detected in the control strains. We isolated a new metabolite (named ishigamide) from the SARP-7-expressing strain and determined its structure as 3-((2E,4E,6E,8E)-13-hydroxytetradeca-2,4,6,8-tetraenamido)propanoic acid. Genome scanning and gene disruption studies identified the ishigamide biosynthetic gene cluster adjacent to the SARP-7 gene. We think that a new subfamily of type II polyketide synthase is involved in the biosynthesis of the polyene structure of ishigamide.	1
Title: Kexin-like endoprotease KexB is required for N-glycan processing, morphogenesis and virulence in Aspergillus fumigatus Abstract: Kexin-like proteins belong to the subtilisin-like family of the proteinases that cleave secretory proproteins to their active forms. Several fungal kexin-like proteins have been investigated. The mutants lacking of kexin-like protein display strong phenotypes such as cell wall defect, abnormal polarity, and, in case of Candida albicans, diminished virulence. However, only several proteins have been confirmed as the substrates of kexin-like proteases in these fungal species. It still remains unclear how kexin-like proteins contribute to the morphogenesis in these fungal species. In this study, a kexB-null mutant of the human opportunistic fungal pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus was constructed and analyzed. The ΔkexB mutant showed retarded growth, temperature-sensitive cell wall defect, reduced conidia formation, and abnormal polarity. Biochemical analyses revealed that deletion of the kexB gene resulted in impaired N-glycan processing, activation of the MpkA-dependent cell wall integrity signaling pathway, and ER-stress. Results from in vivo assays demonstrated that the mutant exhibited an attenuated virulence in immunecompromised mice. Based on our results, the kexin-like endoprotease KexB was involved in the N-glycan processing, which provides a novel insight to understand how kexin-like protein affects the cell-wall modifying enzymes and therefore morphogenesis in fungi.	0
Title: Cloning and characterization of polyketide synthase genes for jadomycin B biosynthesis in Streptomyces venezuelae ISP5230 Abstract: Hybridizing fragments in the genomic DNA of Streptomyces venezuelae ISP5230, which produces the jadomycin group of angucycline antibiotics, were detected by probing with actI DNA from Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2). The hybridizing regions were isolated from a 16.5 kb insert of S. venezuelae DNA recovered from a genomic library cloned in a lambda replacement vector. Subcloning and sequencing of a 4.8 kb segment of the insert, containing regions hybridizing to actIII as well as actI, identified five open reading frames (ORFs). The deduced polypeptide products of the ORFs closely resemble in sequence the components of streptomycete type-II polyketide synthases (PKSs): the ORF1 product corresponds to the ketoacyl synthase, and the ORF2 product to a polypeptide closely related to the ketoacyl synthase and involved in determining chain length; the ORF3 product matches the acyl carrier protein; ORF4 encodes a bifunctional cyclase/dehydrase; and ORF5 encodes a ketoreductase. Integration into the chromosomal DNA of a plasmid containing a segment of the ORF2-ORF4 region severely depressed jadomycin B biosynthesis; since the integrant showed no change in growth or spore pigmentation, the cloned PKS genes are presumed to encode enzymes in the pathway for jadomycin biosynthesis.	1
Title: Characterization of a Copper-Chelating Natural Product from the Methanotroph Methylosinus sp. LW3 Abstract: Methanobactins (Mbns) are ribosomally produced, post-translationally modified peptidic natural products that bind copper with high affinity. Methanotrophic bacteria use Mbns to acquire copper needed for enzymatic methane oxidation. Despite the presence of Mbn operons in a range of methanotroph and other bacterial genomes, few Mbns have been isolated and structurally characterized. Here we report the isolation of a novel Mbn from the methanotroph Methylosinus (Ms.) sp. LW3. Mass spectrometric and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopic data indicate that this Mbn, the largest characterized to date, consists of a 13-amino acid backbone modified to include pyrazinedione/oxazolone rings and neighboring thioamide groups derived from cysteine residues. The pyrazinedione ring is more stable to acid hydrolysis than the oxazolone ring and likely protects the Mbn from degradation. The structure corresponds exactly to that predicted on the basis of the Ms. sp. LW3 Mbn operon content, providing support for the proposed role of an uncharacterized biosynthetic enzyme, MbnF, and expanding the diversity of known Mbns.	1
Title: Development of a carbon-11 PET radiotracer for imaging TRPC5 in the brain Abstract: The transient receptor potential channel subfamily member 5 (TRPC5) is a calcium permeable cation channel widely expressed in the brain. Accumulating evidence indicates that it plays a crucial role in psychiatric disorders including depression and anxiety. Positron emission tomography (PET) combined with a TRPC5 specific radioligand may provide a unique tool to investigate the functions of TRPC5 in animal disease models to guide drug development targeting TRPC5. To develop a TRPC5 PET radiotracer, the potent TRPC5 inhibitor HC608 was chosen for C-11 radiosynthesis through the N-demethyl amide precursor 7 reacting with [11C]methyl iodide. Under optimized conditions, [11C]HC608 was achieved with good radiochemical yield (25 ± 5%), high chemical and radiochemical purity (>99%), and high specific activity (204-377 GBq μmol-1, decay corrected to the end of bombardment, EOB). The in vitro autoradiography study revealed that [11C]HC608 specifically binds to TRPC5. Moreover, initial in vivo evaluation of [11C]HC608 performed in rodents and the microPET study in the brain of non-human primates further demonstrated that [11C]HC608 was able to penetrate the blood brain barrier and sufficiently accumulate in the brain. These results suggest that [11C]HC608 has the potential to be a PET tracer for imaging TRPC5 in vivo.	0
Title: Biochemical characterization of a type III polyketide biosynthetic gene cluster from Streptomyces toxytricini Abstract: A type III polyketide biosynthetic gene cluster has been discovered in the industrially important strain Streptomyces toxytricini NRRL 15443, including four genes stp450-1, stts, stp450-2, and stmo. The stts gene encodes a putative type III polyketide synthase that is homologous to RppA, a 1,3,6,8-tetrahydroxynaphthalene (THN) synthase from Streptomyces griseus. The deduced protein product of stmo resembles the cupin-containing monooxygenase MomA from Streptomyces antibioticus that oxidizes THN into flaviolin. Two cytochrome P450s (CYPs), StP450-1 and StP450-2, are present in the gene cluster. StTS was overexpressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) and identified as a THN synthase. The synthesized THN can be easily oxidized into flaviolin by air. Both CYPs were reconstituted in E. coli BL21(DE3) and can oxidize flaviolin to form oligomers. The k(cat)/K(m) values for StP450-1 and StP450-2 were 0.28 and 0.71 min⁻¹ mM⁻¹, respectively. UV irradiation test showed that expression of StTS in E. coli BL21(DE3) significantly protects the cells from UV radiation, and coexpression of StTS and StP450-1 provides even stronger protection.	1
Title: Skeletal Editing-Nitrogen Deletion of Secondary Amines by Anomeric Amide Reagents Abstract: Late-stage modification is highly desirable for the diversification and modification of biologically active compounds. Peripheral editing (e.g., C-H activation) has been the predominant methodology, whereas skeletal editing is in its infancy. The single-atom N-deletion using anomeric amide reagents constitutes a powerful tool to modify the underlying molecular skeletons of secondary amines. N-pivaloyloxy-N-alkoxyamide is easily prepared on a large scale and promotes C-C bond formation in good yields under the extrusion of N2 for a variety of (cyclic) aliphatic amines. The exploitation of widely available amines allows the use of existing amine synthesis protocols to translate into the construction of new C-C bonds, enabling ring contraction and the potential for structure optimization of biologically active compounds.	0
Title: FW0622, a new siderophore isolated from marine Verrucosispora sp. by genomic mining Abstract: Using the draft genome sequence of Verrucosispora sp. FIM060022, we have identified a new desferrioxamine-like siderophore, FW0622. This is the first chemically characterized siderophore obtained from Verrucosispora. The structure was elucidated by extensive spectral analyses. The biosynthetic pathway of FW0622 was proposed to occur via the non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS)-independent (NIS) synthetase pathway based on the putative biosynthetic siderophore gene cluster in FIM060022. The results demonstrate that marine-derived Verrucosispora species deserve recognition as an important source of new natural products. Furthermore, this study verified that genome mining is an effective way to identify compounds that may be overlooked by traditional methods.	1
Title: Identification and profiling of microRNAs and differentially expressed genes during anther development between a genetic male-sterile mutant and its wildtype cotton via high-throughput RNA sequencing Abstract: Genetic male sterility (GMS) facilitates hybrid seed production in crops including cotton (Gossypium hirsutum). However, the genetic and molecular mechanisms specifically involved in this developmental process are poorly understood. In this study, small RNA sequencing, degradome sequencing, and transcriptome sequencing were performed to analyze miRNAs and their target genes during anther development in a GMS mutant ('Dong A') and its fertile wildtype (WT). A total of 80 known and 220 novel miRNAs were identified, 71 of which showed differential expressions during anther development. A further degradome sequencing revealed a total of 117 candidate target genes cleaved by 16 known and 36 novel miRNAs. Based on RNA-seq, 24, 11, and 21 predicted target genes showed expression correlations with the corresponding miRNAs at the meiosis, tetrad and uninucleate stages, respectively. In addition, a large number of differentially expressed genes were identified, most of which were involved in sucrose and starch metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism, and plant hormone signal transduction based on Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis. The results of our study provide valuable information for further functional investigations of the important miRNAs and target genes involved in genetic male sterility and advance our understanding of miRNA regulatory functions during cotton anther development.	0
Title: Cretaceous origin of the unique prey-capture apparatus in mega-diverse genus: stem lineage of Steninae rove beetles discovered in Burmese amber Abstract: Stenus is the largest genus of rove beetles and the second largest among animals. Its evolutionary success was associated with the adhesive labial prey-capture apparatus, a unique apomorphy of that genus. Definite Stenus with prey-capture apparatus are known from the Cenozoic fossils, while the age and early evolution of Steninae was hardly ever hypothesized. Our study of several Cretaceous Burmese amber inclusions revealed a stem lineage of Steninae that possibly possesses the Stenus-like prey-capture apparatus. Phylogenetic analysis of extinct and extant taxa of Steninae and putatively allied subfamilies of Staphylinidae with parsimony and Bayesian approaches resolved the Burmese amber lineage as a member of Steninae. It justified the description of a new extinct stenine genus Festenus with two new species, F. robustus and F. gracilis. The Late Cretaceous age of Festenus suggests an early origin of prey-capture apparatus in Steninae that, perhaps, drove the evolution towards the crown Stenus. Our analysis confirmed the well-established sister relationships between Steninae and Euaesthetinae and resolved Scydmaeninae as their next closest relative, the latter having no stable position in recent phylogenetic studies of rove beetles. Close affiliation of Megalopsidiinae, a subfamily often considered as a sister group to Euaesthetinae + Steninae clade, is rejected.	0
Title: Discovery of cahuitamycins as biofilm inhibitors derived from a convergent biosynthetic pathway Abstract: Pathogenic microorganisms often have the ability to attach to a surface, building a complex matrix where they colonize to form a biofilm. This cellular superstructure can display increased resistance to antibiotics and cause serious, persistent health problems in humans. Here we describe a high-throughput in vitro screen to identify inhibitors of Acinetobacter baumannii biofilms using a library of natural product extracts derived from marine microbes. Analysis of extracts derived from Streptomyces gandocaensis results in the discovery of three peptidic metabolites (cahuitamycins A-C), with cahuitamycin C being the most effective inhibitor (IC50=14.5 μM). Biosynthesis of cahuitamycin C proceeds via a convergent biosynthetic pathway, with one of the steps apparently being catalysed by an unlinked gene encoding a 6-methylsalicylate synthase. Efforts to assess starter unit diversification through selective mutasynthesis lead to production of unnatural analogues cahuitamycins D and E of increased potency (IC50=8.4 and 10.5 μM).	1
Title: Total biosynthesis of antitumor nonribosomal peptides in Escherichia coli Abstract: Nonribosomal peptides (NRPs) are a class of microbial secondary metabolites that have a wide variety of medicinally important biological activities, such as antibiotic (vancomycin), immunosuppressive (cyclosporin A), antiviral (luzopeptin A) and antitumor (echinomycin and triostin A) activities. However, many microbes are not amenable to cultivation and require time-consuming empirical optimization of incubation conditions for mass production of desired secondary metabolites for clinical and commercial use. Therefore, a fast, simple system for heterologous production of natural products is much desired. Here we show the first example of the de novo total biosynthesis of biologically active forms of heterologous NRPs in Escherichia coli. Our system can serve not only as an effective and flexible platform for large-scale preparation of natural products from simple carbon and nitrogen sources, but also as a general tool for detailed characterizations and rapid engineering of biosynthetic pathways for microbial syntheses of novel compounds and their analogs.	1
Title: A Single Gene Cluster for Chalcomycins and Aldgamycins: Genetic Basis for Bifurcation of Their Biosynthesis Abstract: Aldgamycins are 16-membered macrolide antibiotics with a rare branched-chain sugar d-aldgarose or decarboxylated d-aldgarose at C-5. In our efforts to clone the gene cluster for aldgamycins from a marine-derived Streptomyces sp. HK-2006-1 capable of producing both aldgamycins and chalcomycins, we found that both are biosynthesized from a single gene cluster. Whole-genome sequencing combined with gene disruption established the entire gene cluster of aldgamycins: nine new genes are incorporated with the previously identified chalcomycin gene cluster. Functional analysis of these genes revealed that almDI/almDII, (encoding α/β subunits of pyruvate dehydrogenase) triggers the biosynthesis of aldgamycins, whereas almCI (encoding an oxidoreductase) initiates chalcomycins biosynthesis. This is the first report that aldgamycins and chalcomycins are derived from a single gene cluster and of the genetic basis for bifurcation in their biosynthesis.	1
Title: Tunable Expression Systems for Orthogonal DNA Replication Abstract: We recently developed an orthogonal DNA replication (OrthoRep) system capable of driving the rapid continuous evolution of genes in vivo. However, OrthoRep uses a special transcription system, the components of which (e.g., promoters) have previously limited the strength with which OrthoRep-encoded genes can be expressed. Here, we report a collection of synthetic and evolved OrthoRep expression parts that allow OrthoRep-encoded genes to span expression levels matching those of endogenous Saccharomyces cerevisiae genes. Specifically, we found that various promoter mutations as well as a genetically encoded poly(A) tail enable us to tune the expression level of OrthoRep-encoded genes over a large range and up to levels 43-fold higher than were previously attained, reaching at least ∼40% of the strength of the genomic TDH3 promoter. We further show that expression level gains using our new parts are stable over passaging and consistent across multiple genes and OrthoRep systems of different mutation rates. This new set of expression parts further expands OrthoRep's applicability to the continuous in vivo evolution of proteins and pathways.	0
Title: Four-electron oxidation of p-hydroxylaminobenzoate to p-nitrobenzoate by a peroxodiferric complex in AurF from Streptomyces thioluteus Abstract: The nonheme di-iron oxygenase, AurF, converts p-aminobenzoate (Ar-NH(2), where Ar = 4-carboxyphenyl) to p-nitrobenzoate (Ar-NO(2)) in the biosynthesis of the antibiotic, aureothin, by Streptomyces thioluteus. It has been reported that this net six-electron oxidation proceeds in three consecutive, two-electron steps, through p-hydroxylaminobenzoate (Ar-NHOH) and p-nitrosobenzoate (Ar-NO) intermediates, with each step requiring one equivalent of O(2) and two exogenous reducing equivalents. We recently demonstrated that a peroxodiiron(III/III) complex (peroxo- -AurF) formed by addition of O(2) to the diiron(II/II) enzyme ( -AurF) effects the initial oxidation of Ar-NH(2), generating a mu-(oxo)diiron(III/III) form of the enzyme (mu-oxo- -AurF) and (presumably) Ar-NHOH. Here we show that peroxo- -AurF also oxidizes Ar-NHOH. Unexpectedly, this reaction proceeds through to the Ar-NO(2) final product, a four-electron oxidation, and produces -AurF, with which O(2) can combine to regenerate peroxo- -AurF. Thus, conversion of Ar-NHOH to Ar-NO(2) requires only a single equivalent of O(2) and (starting from -AurF or peroxo- -AurF) is fully catalytic in the absence of exogenous reducing equivalents, by contrast to the published stoichiometry. This novel type of four-electron N-oxidation is likely also to occur in the reaction sequences of nitro-installing di-iron amine oxygenases in the biosyntheses of other natural products.	1
Title: Total synthesis and biological evaluation of largazole and derivatives with promising selectivity for cancers cells Abstract: The efficient total synthesis of the natural substance largazole is described. Using this strategy, a small library of largazole analogs was developed. Structure-activity relationship studies suggested that the geometry of the alkene in the side chain is critical. While the largazole's analogues with trans-alkene are potent for the antiproliferative effect, those with cis-alkene are completely inactive. Most importantly, replacement of valine with tyrosine in largazole increased selectivity toward human cancer cells over human normal cells more than 100-fold.	0
Title: Accramycin A, a New Aromatic Polyketide, from the Soil Bacterium, Streptomyces sp. MA37 Abstract: Drug-like molecules are known to contain many different building blocks with great potential as pharmacophores for drug discovery. The continued search for unique scaffolds in our laboratory led to the isolation of a novel Ghanaian soil bacterium, Streptomyces sp. MA37. This strain produces many bioactive molecules, most of which belong to carbazoles, pyrrolizidines, and fluorinated metabolites. Further probing of the metabolites of MA37 has led to the discovery of a new naphthacene-type aromatic natural product, which we have named accramycin A 1. This molecule was isolated using an HPLC-photodiode array (PDA) guided isolation process and MS/MS molecular networking. The structure of 1 was characterized by detailed analysis of LC-MS, UV, 1D, and 2D NMR data. Preliminary studies on the antibacterial properties of 1 using Group B Streptococcus (GBS) produced a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 27 µg/mL. This represents the first report of such bioactivity amongst the naphthacene-type aromatic polyketides, and also suggests the possibility for the further development of potent molecules against GBS based on the accramycin scaffold. A putative acc biosynthetic pathway for accramycin, featuring a tridecaketide-specific type II polyketide synthase, was proposed.	1
Title: ALDH2 mediates 5-nitrofuran activity in multiple species Abstract: Understanding how drugs work in vivo is critical for drug design and for maximizing the potential of currently available drugs. 5-nitrofurans are a class of prodrugs widely used to treat bacterial and trypanosome infections, but despite relative specificity, 5-nitrofurans often cause serious toxic side effects in people. Here, we use yeast and zebrafish, as well as human in vitro systems, to assess the biological activity of 5-nitrofurans, and we identify a conserved interaction between aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) 2 and 5-nitrofurans across these species. In addition, we show that the activity of nifurtimox, a 5-nitrofuran anti-trypanosome prodrug, is dependent on zebrafish Aldh2 and is a substrate for human ALDH2. This study reveals a conserved and biologically relevant ALDH2-5-nitrofuran interaction that may have important implications for managing the toxicity of 5-nitrofuran treatment.	0
Title: Sequence-independent processing site of the C-terminal domain (CTD) influences maturation of the RgpB protease from Porphyromonas gingivalis Abstract: The Gram-negative periodontal pathogen Porphyromonas gingivalis produces a family of outer membrane-anchored proteases, the gingipains, shown to play an essential role in virulence of the organism. The C-terminal domain (CTD) of gingipains and other secreted proteins is known to be the targeting signal for maturation and translocation of the protein through the outer membrane. The CTD is subsequently cleaved during the secretion process. Multiple alignment of various CTDs failed to define a consensus sequence at the putative CTD processing site. Using mutagenesis, we were able to show that cleavage at the site is not dependent on a specific residue and that recognition of the site is independent of local sequence. Interestingly, length of the junction between the CTD and adjacent Ig-like subdomain has a critical influence on post-translational glycan modification of the protein, whereby insertion of additional residues immediately N-terminal to the cleavage site results in failure of glycan modification and release of soluble protease into the culture medium. Various hypotheses are presented to explain these phenomena. Knowledge of the role CTDs play in maturation of gingipains has broader application for understanding maturation of CTD homologues expressed by bacteria of the Bacteriodetes phylum.	0
Title: Production and characterization of a recombinant single-chain antibody against Hantaan virus envelop glycoprotein Abstract: Hantaan virus (HTNV) is the type of Hantavirus causing hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome, for which no specific therapeutics are available so far. Cell type-specific internalizing antibodies can be used to deliver therapeutics intracellularly to target cell and thus, have potential application in anti-HTNV infection. To achieve intracellular delivery of therapeutics, it is necessary to obtain antibodies that demonstrate sufficient cell type-specific binding, internalizing, and desired cellular trafficking. Here, we describe the prokaryotic expression, affinity purification, and functional testing of a single-chain Fv antibody fragment (scFv) against HTNV envelop glycoprotein (GP), an HTNV-specific antigen normally located on the membranes of HTNV-infected cells. This HTNV GP-targeting antibody, scFv3G1, was produced in the cytoplasm of Escherichia coli cells as a soluble protein and was purified by immobilized metal affinity chromatography. The purified scFv possessed a high specific antigen-binding activity to HTNV GP and HTNV-infected Vero E6 cells and could be internalized into HTNV-infected cells probably through the clathrin-dependent endocytosis pathways similar to that observed with transferrin. Our results showed that the E. coli-produced scFv had potential applications in targeted and intracellular delivery of therapeutics against HTNV infections.	0
Title: Cyanochelins, an Overlooked Class of Widely Distributed Cyanobacterial Siderophores, Discovered by Silent Gene Cluster Awakening Abstract: Cyanobacteria require iron for growth and often inhabit iron-limited habitats, yet only a few siderophores are known to be produced by them. We report that cyanobacterial genomes frequently encode polyketide synthase (PKS)/nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) biosynthetic pathways for synthesis of lipopeptides featuring β-hydroxyaspartate (β-OH-Asp), a residue known to be involved in iron chelation. Iron starvation triggered the synthesis of β-OH-Asp lipopeptides in the cyanobacteria Rivularia sp. strain PCC 7116, Leptolyngbya sp. strain NIES-3755, and Rubidibacter lacunae strain KORDI 51-2. The induced compounds were confirmed to bind iron by mass spectrometry (MS) and were capable of Fe3+ to Fe2+ photoreduction, accompanied by their cleavage, when exposed to sunlight. The siderophore from Rivularia, named cyanochelin A, was structurally characterized by MS and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and found to contain a hydrophobic tail bound to phenolate and oxazole moieties followed by five amino acids, including two modified aspartate residues for iron chelation. Phylogenomic analysis revealed 26 additional cyanochelin-like gene clusters across a broad range of cyanobacterial lineages. Our data suggest that cyanochelins and related compounds are widespread β-OH-Asp-featuring cyanobacterial siderophores produced by phylogenetically distant species upon iron starvation. Production of photolabile siderophores by phototrophic cyanobacteria raises questions about whether the compounds facilitate iron monopolization by the producer or, rather, provide Fe2+ for the whole microbial community via photoreduction. IMPORTANCE All living organisms depend on iron as an essential cofactor for indispensable enzymes. However, the sources of bioavailable iron are often limited. To face this problem, microorganisms synthesize low-molecular-weight metabolites capable of iron scavenging, i.e., the siderophores. Although cyanobacteria inhabit the majority of the Earth's ecosystems, their repertoire of known siderophores is remarkably poor. Their genomes are known to harbor a rich variety of gene clusters with unknown function. Here, we report the awakening of a widely distributed class of silent gene clusters by iron starvation to yield cyanochelins, β-hydroxy aspartate lipopeptides involved in iron acquisition. Our results expand the limited arsenal of known cyanobacterial siderophores and propose products with ecological function for a number of previously orphan gene clusters.	1
Title: Organization of the Escherichia coli K-12 gene cluster responsible for production of the extracellular polysaccharide colanic acid Abstract: Colanic acid (CA) is an extracellular polysaccharide produced by most Escherichia coli strains as well as by other species of the family Enterobacteriaceae. We have determined the sequence of a 23-kb segment of the E. coli K-12 chromosome which includes the cluster of genes necessary for production of CA. The CA cluster comprises 19 genes. Two other sequenced genes (orf1.3 and galF), which are situated between the CA cluster and the O-antigen cluster, were shown to be unnecessary for CA production. The CA cluster includes genes for synthesis of GDP-L-fucose, one of the precursors of CA, and the gene for one of the enzymes in this pathway (GDP-D-mannose 4,6-dehydratase) was identified by biochemical assay. Six of the inferred proteins show sequence similarity to glycosyl transferases, and two others have sequence similarity to acetyl transferases. Another gene (wzx) is predicted to encode a protein with multiple transmembrane segments and may function in export of the CA repeat unit from the cytoplasm into the periplasm in a process analogous to O-unit export. The first three genes of the cluster are predicted to encode an outer membrane lipoprotein, a phosphatase, and an inner membrane protein with an ATP-binding domain. Since homologs of these genes are found in other extracellular polysaccharide gene clusters, they may have a common function, such as export of polysaccharide from the cell.	1
Title: Leveraging kinase inhibitors to develop small molecule tools for imaging kinases by fluorescence microscopy Abstract: As the usage of fluorescence microscopy as a tool to study biological systems continues to grow, so does the need for additional tools that permit the selective detection of proteins of interest. Existing selective and well-characterized kinase inhibitors may be exploited to develop novel small molecule probes useful in imaging kinases by fluorescence microscopy.	0
Title: Characterization of streptonigrin biosynthesis reveals a cryptic carboxyl methylation and an unusual oxidative cleavage of a N-C bond Abstract: Streptonigrin (STN, 1) is a highly functionalized aminoquinone alkaloid with broad and potent antitumor activity. Here, we reported the biosynthetic gene cluster of STN identified by genome scanning of a STN producer Streptomyces flocculus CGMCC4.1223. This cluster consists of 48 genes determined by a series of gene inactivations. On the basis of the structures of intermediates and shunt products accumulated from five specific gene inactivation mutants and feeding experiments, the biosynthetic pathway was proposed, and the sequence of tailoring steps was preliminarily determined. In this pathway, a cryptic methylation of lavendamycin was genetically and biochemically characterized to be catalyzed by a leucine carboxyl methyltransferase StnF2. A [2Fe-2S](2+) cluster-containing aromatic ring dioxygenase StnB1/B2 system was biochemically characterized to catalyze a regiospecific cleavage of the N-C8' bond of the indole ring of the methyl ester of lavendamycin. This work provides opportunities to illuminate the enzymology of novel reactions involved in this pathway and to create, using genetic and chemo-enzymatic methods, new streptonigrinoid analogues as potential therapeutic agents.	1
Title: In vitro antibacterial activity and interactions with beta-lactamases and penicillin-binding proteins of the new monocarbam antibiotic U-78608 Abstract: U-78608, a new monocarbam antibiotic, was evaluated for in vitro activity against 312 clinical isolates of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria and subjected to several in vitro biochemical tests characterizing its interactions with beta-lactamases and penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs). The antibacterial activity of the compound was compared directly with those of SQ 83,360 (pirazmonam) and aztreonam. U-78608, SQ 83,360, and aztreonam had generally poor activity against gram-positive aerobic bacteria and anaerobic bacteria. U-78608 demonstrated activity primarily against gram-negative aerobic bacteria, with potency generally comparable to that of SQ 83,360. U-78608 and SQ 83,360 were less active than aztreonam for some gram-negative species; however, both compounds were 8- to 64-fold more active than aztreonam against Acinetobacter species, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Pseudomonas maltophilia. All three compounds resisted inactivation by several different beta-lactamases from gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Neither U-78608 nor SQ 83,360 exhibited significant inhibition of these enzymes, while aztreonam inhibited beta-lactamases from P. aeurginosa and Klebsiella oxytoca. All three compounds exhibited strong affinity to PBP 3 of Escherichia coli and moderate to negligible affinity to the other E. coli PBPs; quantitative measurements indicated that U-78608 had greater PBP 3 affinity than either SQ 83,360 or aztreonam.	0
Title: Hydrophobic forces dominate the thermodynamic characteristics of UvrA-DNA damage interactions Abstract: The Escherichia coli DNA repair proteins UvrA, UvrB and UvrC work together to recognize and incise DNA damage during the process of nucleotide excision repair (NER). To gain an understanding of the damage recognition properties of UvrA, we have used fluorescence spectroscopy to study the thermodynamics of its interaction with a defined DNA substrate containing a benzo[a]pyrene diol epoxide (BPDE) adduct. Oligonucleotides containing a single site-specifically modified N2-guanine (+)-trans-, (-)-trans-, (+)-cis-, or (-)-cis-BPDE adducts were ligated into 50-base-pair DNA fragments. All four stereoisomers of DNA-BPDE adducts show an excitation maximum at 350 nm and an emission maximum around 380 to 385 nm. Binding of UvrA to the BPDE-DNA adducts results in a five to sevenfold fluorescence enhancement. Titration of the BPDE-adducted DNA with UvrA was used to generate binding isotherms. The equilibrium dissociation constants for UvrA binding to (+)-trans-, (-)-trans-, (+)-cis-, and (-)-cis- BPDE adduct were: 7.4+/-1.9, 15. 8+/-5.4, 11.3+/-2.7 and 22.4+/-2.0 nM, respectively. There was a large negative change in heat capacity DeltaCpo,obs, (-3.3 kcal mol-1 K-1) accompanied by a relatively unchanged DeltaGoobs with temperature. Furthermore, varying the concentration of KCl showed that the number of ions released upon formation of UvrA-DNA complex is about 3.4, a relatively small value compared to the contact size of UvrA with the substrate. These data suggest that hydrophobic interactions are an important driving force for UvrA binding to BPDE-damaged DNA.	0
Title: Multiple regulatory events in the development of competence for genetic transformation in Haemophilus influenzae Abstract: Cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate derepresses enzyme synthesis but does not yield high levels of transformability or detectable levels of competence-related envelope polypeptides. Additional regulatory events must trigger complete expression of competence.	0
Title: A Cutibacterium acnes antibiotic modulates human skin microbiota composition in hair follicles Abstract: The composition of the skin microbiota varies widely among individuals when sampled at the same body site. A key question is which molecular factors determine strain-level variability within sub-ecosystems of the skin microbiota. Here, we used a genomics-guided approach to identify an antibacterial biosynthetic gene cluster in Cutibacterium acnes (formerly Propionibacterium acnes), a human skin commensal bacterium that is widely distributed across individuals and skin sites. Experimental characterization of this biosynthetic gene cluster resulted in identification of a new thiopeptide antibiotic, cutimycin. Analysis of individual human skin hair follicles revealed that cutimycin contributed to the ecology of the skin hair follicle microbiota and helped to reduce colonization of skin hair follicles by Staphylococcus species.	1
Title: Characterization of tailoring genes involved in the modification of geldanamycin polyketide in Streptomyces hygroscopicus JCM4427 Abstract: Geldanamycin and its analogs are important anticancer agents that inhibit the newly targeted, heat-shock protein (Hsp) 90, which is a chaperone protein in eukaryotic cells. To resolve which geldanamycin biosynthetic genes are responsible for particular post-polyketide synthase (PKS) processing steps and in which order the reactions occur, we individually inactivated candidate genes in Streptomyces hygroscopicus subsp. duamyceticus JCM4427, and isolated and elucidated the structures of intermediates from each mutant. The results indicated that gel7 governs at least one of the benzoquinone ring oxidation steps. In addition, gel16 was found to be involved in double-bond formation between C-4 and C-5 of 4,5-dihydrogeldanamycin, which confirmed our previous findings that this double bond reduced during the post-PKS modification of the polyketide assembly. In addition, pro-geldanamycin, which does not possess a double bond at C-4/5, was purified from the gel7 and 8 double-gene-inactivated mutant.	1
Title: Conjugate Vaccines from Bacterial Antigens by Squaric Acid Chemistry: A Closer Look Abstract: By using O-SP-core (O-SPcNH2 ) polysaccharide, isolated from Vibrio cholera O1 lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and related synthetic substances, a detailed study of factors that affect conjugation of bacterial polysaccharides to protein carriers through squaric acid chemistry to form conjugate vaccines has been carried out. Several previously unrecognized processes that take place during the squarate labeling of the O-SPcNH2 and subsequent conjugation of the formed squarate (O-SPcNH-SqOMe) have been identified. The efficiency of conjugation at pH 8.5, 9.0, and 9.5 to bovine serum albumin (BSA) and to the recombinant tetanus toxin fragment C (rTT-Hc) has been determined. The study led to a protocol for more efficient labeling of O-SPcNH2 antigen with the methyl squarate group, to yield a higher-quality, more potent squarate conjugation reagent. Its use resulted in about twofold increases in conjugation efficiency (from 23-26 % on BSA to 51 % on BSA and 55 % on rTT-Hc). The spent conjugation reagent could be recovered and regenerated by treatment with MeI in the absence of additional base. The immunological properties of the experimental vaccine made from the regenerated conjugation reagent were comparable with those of the immunogen made from the parent O-SPcNH-SqOMe.	0
Title: A PKS/NRPS/FAS hybrid gene cluster from Serratia plymuthica RVH1 encoding the biosynthesis of three broad spectrum, zeamine-related antibiotics Abstract: Serratia plymuthica strain RVH1, initially isolated from an industrial food processing environment, displays potent antimicrobial activity towards a broad spectrum of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial pathogens. Isolation and subsequent structure determination of bioactive molecules led to the identification of two polyamino antibiotics with the same molecular structure as zeamine and zeamine II as well as a third, closely related analogue, designated zeamine I. The gene cluster encoding the biosynthesis of the zeamine antibiotics was cloned and sequenced and shown to encode FAS, PKS as well as NRPS related enzymes in addition to putative tailoring and export enzymes. Interestingly, several genes show strong homology to the pfa cluster of genes involved in the biosynthesis of long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids in marine bacteria. We postulate that a mixed FAS/PKS and a hybrid NRPS/PKS assembly line each synthesize parts of the backbone that are linked together post-assembly in the case of zeamine and zeamine I. This interaction reflects a unique interplay between secondary lipid and secondary metabolite biosynthesis. Most likely, the zeamine antibiotics are produced as prodrugs that undergo activation in which a nonribosomal peptide sequence is cleaved off.	1
Title: Cloning and sequencing of the chaetocin biosynthetic gene cluster Abstract: How a fungus does it: The epidithiodiketopiperazine (ETP) fungal alkaloids, which include gliotoxin, have garnered much attention since their initial isolation. The cloning and sequencing of the biosynthetic gene cluster for another ETP, chaetocin A were used to suggest a route towards dimerization and sulfur incorporation in these molecules.	1
Title: General and Robust Chemoenzymatic Method for Glycan-Mediated Site-Specific Labeling and Conjugation of Antibodies: Facile Synthesis of Homogeneous Antibody-Drug Conjugates Abstract: Site-specific labeling and conjugation of antibodies are highly desirable for fundamental research and for developing more efficient diagnostic and therapeutic methods. We report here a general and robust chemoenzymatic method that permits a one-pot site-specific functionalization of antibodies. A series of selectively modified disaccharide oxazoline derivatives were designed, synthesized, and evaluated as donor substrates of different endoglycosidases for antibody Fc glycan remodeling. We found that among several endoglycosidases tested, wild-type endoglycosidase from Streptococcus pyogenes of serotype M49 (Endo-S2) exhibited remarkable activity in transferring the functionalized disaccharides carrying site-selectively modified azide, biotin, or fluorescent tags to antibodies without hydrolyzing the resulting transglycosylation products. This discovery, together with the excellent Fc deglycosylation activity of Endo-S2 on recombinant antibodies, allowed direct labeling and functionalization of antibodies in a one-pot manner without the need of intermediate and enzyme separation. The site-specific introduction of varied numbers of azide groups enabled a highly efficient synthesis of homogeneous antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) with a precise control of the drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR) ranging from 2 to 12 via a copper-free strain-promoted click reaction. Cell viability assays showed that ADCs with higher DARs were more potent in killing antigen-overexpressed cells than the ADCs with lower DARs. This new method is expected to find applications not only for antibody-drug conjugation but also for cell labeling, imaging, and diagnosis.	0
Title: Structure Elucidation and Activity of Kolossin A, the D-/L-Pentadecapeptide Product of a Giant Nonribosomal Peptide Synthetase Abstract: The largest continuous bacterial nonribosomal peptide synthetase discovered so far is described. It consists of 15 consecutive modules arising from an uninterrupted, fully functional gene in the entomopathogenic bacterium Photorhabdus luminescens. The identification of its cryptic biosynthesis product was achieved by using a combination of genome analysis, promoter exchange, isotopic labeling experiments, and total synthesis of a focused collection of peptide candidates. Although it belongs to the growing class of D-/ L-peptide natural products, the encoded metabolite kolossin A was found to be largely devoid of antibiotic activity and is likely involved in interspecies communication. A stereoisomer of this peculiar natural product displayed high activity against Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense, a recalcitrant parasite that causes the deadly disease African sleeping sickness.	1
Title: Commensal bacteria make GPCR ligands that mimic human signalling molecules Abstract: Commensal bacteria are believed to have important roles in human health. The mechanisms by which they affect mammalian physiology remain poorly understood, but bacterial metabolites are likely to be key components of host interactions. Here we use bioinformatics and synthetic biology to mine the human microbiota for N-acyl amides that interact with G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). We found that N-acyl amide synthase genes are enriched in gastrointestinal bacteria and the lipids that they encode interact with GPCRs that regulate gastrointestinal tract physiology. Mouse and cell-based models demonstrate that commensal GPR119 agonists regulate metabolic hormones and glucose homeostasis as efficiently as human ligands, although future studies are needed to define their potential physiological role in humans. Our results suggest that chemical mimicry of eukaryotic signalling molecules may be common among commensal bacteria and that manipulation of microbiota genes encoding metabolites that elicit host cellular responses represents a possible small-molecule therapeutic modality (microbiome-biosynthetic gene therapy).	1
Title: Origin of the allyl group in FK506 biosynthesis Abstract: FK506 (tacrolimus) is a secondary metabolite with a potent immunosuppressive activity, currently registered for use as immunosuppressant after organ transplantation. FK506 and FK520 are biogenetically related natural products that are synthesized by combined polyketide synthase/nonribosomal peptide synthetase systems. The entire gene cluster for biosynthesis of FK520 from Streptomyces hygroscopicus var. ascomyceticus has been cloned and sequenced. On the other hand, the FK506 gene cluster from Streptomyces sp. MA6548 (ATCC55098) was sequenced only partially, and it was reasonable to expect that additional genes would be required for the provision of substrate supply. Here we report the identification of a previously unknown region of the FK506 gene cluster from Streptomyces tsukubaensis NRRL 18488 containing genes encoding the provision of unusual building blocks for FK506 biosynthesis as well as a regulatory gene. Among others, we identified a group of genes encoding biosynthesis of the extender unit that forms the allyl group at carbon 21 of FK506. Interestingly, we have identified a small independent diketide synthase system involved in the biosynthesis of the allyl group. Inactivation of one of these genes, encoding an unusual ketosynthase domain, resulted in an FK506 nonproducing strain, and the production was restored when a synthetic analog of the allylmalonyl-CoA extender unit was added to the cultivation medium. Based on our results, we propose a biosynthetic pathway for the provision of an unusual five-carbon extender unit, which is carried out by a novel diketide synthase complex.	1
Title: Use of a distant reporter group as evidence for a conformational change in a sensory receptor Abstract: A highly sensitive method for demonstrating ligand-induced conformational changes in protein molecules in solution is described. The method utilizes an environmentally sensitive reporter group that is known to be distant from the active site. In the present application a conformational change is demonstrated in the galactose receptor of Salmonella typhimurium, involved in bacterial sensing and transport, by means of an extrinsic fluorophore, 5-iodoacetamidofluorescein, attached at a single methionine residue, and the intrinsic tryptophan fluorophore. Binding of the ligand galactose perturbs the microenvironment of both the fluorescein and tryptophan, as shown by both spectral and potassium iodide quenching changes. The distance between the two dyes is established by fluorescence energy transfer methods to be 41 +/- 10A. Since only one molecule of galactose binds per molecule of receptor and since the galactose molecule is only about 5 A in length, changes at one of these sites reflect the result of an indirect effect. Hence, there must be a ligand-induced conformational change that is propagated a minimum of 30 A through the receptor molecule.	0
Title: The SPI2-encoded SseA chaperone has discrete domains required for SseB stabilization and export, and binds within the C-terminus of SseB and SseD Abstract: SseA, a key Salmonella virulence determinant, is a small, basic pI protein encoded within the Salmonella pathogenicity island 2 and serves as a type III secretion system chaperone for SseB and SseD. Both SseA partners are subunits of the surface-localized translocon module that delivers effectors into the host cell; SseB is predicted to compose the translocon sheath and SseD is a putative translocon pore subunit. In this study, SseA molecular interactions with its partners were characterized further. Yeast two-hybrid screens indicate that SseA binding requires a C-terminal domain within both partners. An additional central domain within SseD was found to influence binding. The SseA-binding region within SseB was found to encompass a predicted amphipathic helix of a type participating in coiled-coil interactions that are implicated in the assembly of translocon sheaths. Deletions that impinge upon this putative coiled-coiled domain prevent SseA binding, suggesting that SseA occupies a portion of the coiled-coil. SseA occupancy of this motif is envisioned to be sufficient to prevent premature SseB self-association inside bacteria. Domain mapping on the chaperone was also performed. A deletion of the SseA N-terminus, or site-directed mutations within this region, allowed stabilization of SseB, but its export was disrupted. Therefore, the N-terminus of SseA provides a function that is essential for SseB export, but dispensable for partner binding and stabilization.	0
Title: The EAL domain containing protein STM2215 (rtn) is needed during Salmonella infection and has cyclic di-GMP phosphodiesterase activity Abstract: Salmonella Typhimurium gene STM2215 (rtn) is conserved among many enterobacteriaceae. Mutants lacking STM2215 poorly colonized the liver and spleen in intraperitoneal infection of mice and poorly colonized the intestine and deeper tissues in oral infection. These phenotypes were complemented by a wild-type copy of STM2215 provided in trans. STM2215 deletion mutants grew normally in J774A.1 murine macrophages but were unable to invade Caco-2 colonic epithelial cells. Consistent with this finding, mutants in STM2215 produced lower levels of effectors of the TTSS-1. STM2215 is a predicted c-di-GMP phosphodiesterase, but lacks identifiable sensor domains. Biochemical analysis of STM2215 determined that it is located in the inner membrane and has c-di-GMP phosphodiesterase activity in vitro dependent on an intact EAL motif. Unlike some previously identified members of this family, STM2215 did not affect motility, was expressed on plates, and in liquid media at late exponential and early stationary phase during growth. Defined mutations in STM2215 revealed that neither the predicted periplasmic domain nor the anchoring of the protein to the inner membrane is necessary for the activity of this protein during infection. However, the EAL domain of STM2215 is required during infection, suggesting that its phosphodiesterase activity is necessary during infection.	0
Title: Genome Sequence and Annotation of Acremonium chrysogenum, Producer of the β-Lactam Antibiotic Cephalosporin C Abstract: The filamentous fungus Acremonium chrysogenum is the industrial producer of the β-lactam antibiotic cephalosporin C. Here, we present the genome sequence of strain ATCC 11550, which contains genes for 8,901 proteins, 127 tRNAs, and 22 rRNAs. Genome annotation led to the prediction of 42 gene clusters for secondary metabolites.	1
Title: A novel DNA modification by sulphur Abstract: Streptomyces lividans has a novel DNA modification, which sensitises its DNA to degradation during electrophoresis (the Dnd phenotype). The entire gene cluster (dnd) involved in this modification was localized on an 8 kb DNA fragment and was expressed in a S. lividans deletion mutant (dnd) and in several heterologous hosts. Disruption of the dnd locus abolishes the Dnd phenotype, and gain of the dnd locus conferred the Dnd phenotype respectively. Extensive analysis of the dnd gene cluster revealed five open reading frames, whose hypothetic functions suggested an incorporation of sulphur or a sulphur-containing substance into S. lividans genome, yet in an unknown manner. The Dnd phenotype was also discovered to exist in DNA of widespread bacterial species of variable origin and diverse habitat. Similarly organized gene clusters were found in several bacterial genomes representing different genera and in eDNA of marine organisms, suggesting such modification as a widespread phenomenon. A coincidence between the Dnd phenotype and DNA modification by sulphur was demonstrated to occur in several representative bacterial genomes by the in vivo(35)S-labelling experiments.	0
Title: Biosynthesis of benastatin A Abstract: The biosynthesis of benastatin A, produced by Streptomyces sp. MI384-DF12, has been studied by feeding experiments with 14C- and 13C-labeled compounds followed by measurement of radioactivity and 13C NMR analysis. The results indicate that benastatin A is derived from two methionine units and fourteen acetate units, condensed in the "head-to-tail" fashion of typical polyketide biosynthesis.	1
Title: Visible and infrared three-wavelength modulated multi-directional actuators Abstract: In recent years, light-guided robotic soft actuators have attracted intense scientific attention and rapidly developed, although it still remains challenging to precisely and reversibly modulate the moving directions and shape morphing modes of soft actuators with ease of stimulating operation. Here we report a strategy of building a multi-stimuli-responsive liquid crystal elastomer soft actuator system capable of performing not only multi-directional movement, but also different shape morphing modes. This strategy is based on the selective stimulation of specific domains of the hierarchical structured actuator through the modulation of three wavelength bands (520, 808, 980 nm) of light stimulus, which release the actuation system from light scanning position/direction restriction. Three near-infrared dual-wavelength modulated actuators and one visible/infrared tri-wavelength modulated multi-directional walker robot are demonstrated in this work. These devices have broad application prospects in robotic and biomimetic technology.	0
Title: Covalent Targeting of Ras G12C by Rationally Designed Peptidomimetics Abstract: Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) play a critical role in fundamental biological processes. Competitive inhibition of these interfaces requires compounds that can access discontinuous binding epitopes along a large, shallow binding surface area. Conformationally defined protein surface mimics present a viable route to target these interactions. However, the development of minimal protein mimics that engage intracellular targets with high affinity remains a major challenge because mimicry of a portion of the binding interface is often associated with the loss of critical binding interactions. Covalent targeting provides an attractive approach to overcome the loss of noncovalent contacts but have the inherent risk of dominating noncovalent contacts and increasing the likelihood of nonselective binding. Here, we report the iterative design of a proteolytically stable α3β chimeric helix mimic that covalently targets oncogenic Ras G12C as a model system. We explored several electrophiles to optimize preferential alkylation with the desired C12 on Ras. The designed lead peptide modulates nucleotide exchange, inhibits activation of the Ras-mediated signaling cascade, and is selectively toxic toward mutant Ras G12C cancer cells. The relatively high frequency of acquired cysteines as missense mutations in cancer and other diseases suggests that covalent peptides may offer an untapped therapeutic approach for targeting aberrant protein interactions.	0
Title: Differentiation of Bacillus anthracis, B. cereus, and B. thuringiensis on the basis of the csaB gene reflects host source Abstract: csaB gene analysis clustered 198 strains of Bacillus anthracis, Bacillus cereus, and Bacillus thuringiensis into two groups related to mammalian and insect hosts, respectively. Mammal-related group I strains also have more S-layer homology (SLH) protein genes than group II strains. This indicates that csaB-based differentiation reflects selective pressure from animal hosts.	0
Title: Glutamic acid is a carrier for hydrazine during the biosyntheses of fosfazinomycin and kinamycin Abstract: Fosfazinomycin and kinamycin are natural products that contain nitrogen-nitrogen (N-N) bonds but that are otherwise structurally unrelated. Despite their considerable structural differences, their biosynthetic gene clusters share a set of genes predicted to facilitate N-N bond formation. In this study, we show that for both compounds, one of the nitrogen atoms in the N-N bond originates from nitrous acid. Furthermore, we show that for both compounds, an acetylhydrazine biosynthetic synthon is generated first and then funneled via a glutamyl carrier into the respective biosynthetic pathways. Therefore, unlike other pathways to N-N bond-containing natural products wherein the N-N bond is formed directly on a biosynthetic intermediate, during the biosyntheses of fosfazinomycin, kinamycin, and related compounds, the N-N bond is made in an independent pathway that forms a branch of a convergent route to structurally complex natural products.	1
Title: Thermal and (Thermo-Reversible) Photochemical Cycloisomerization of 1 H-2-Benzo[ c]oxocins: From Synthetic Applications to the Development of a New T-Type Molecular Photoswitch Abstract: A novel T-type molecular photoswitch based on the reversible cyclization of 1H-2-benzo[c]oxocins to dihydro-4H-cyclobuta[c]isochromenes has been developed. The switching mechanism involves a light-triggered ring-contraction of 8-membered 1H-2-benzo[c]oxocins to 4,6-fused O-heterocyclic dihydro-4H-cyclobuta[c]isochromene ring systems, with reversion back to the 1H-2-benzo[c]oxocin state accessible through heating. Both processes are unidirectional and proceed with good efficiency, with switching properties─including reversibility and half-life time─easily adjusted via structural functionalization. Our new molecular-switching platform exhibits independence from solvent polarity, originating from its neutral-charge switching mechanism, a property highly sought-after for biological applications. The photoinduced ring-contraction involves a [2+2] conjugated-diene cyclization that obeys the Woodward-Hoffmann rules. In contrast, the reverse process initiates via a thermal ring-opening (T > 60 °C) to produce the original 8-membered 1H-2-benzo[c]oxocins, which is thermally forbidden according to the Woodward-Hoffmann rules. The thermal ring-opening is likely to proceed via an ortho-quinodimethane (o-QDM) intermediate, and the corresponding switching mechanisms are supported by experimental observations and density functional theory calculations. Other transformations of 1H-2-benzo[c]oxocins were found upon altering reaction conditions: prolonged heating of the 1H-2-benzo[c]oxocins at a significantly elevated temperature (72 h at 120 °C), with the resulting dihydronaphthalenes formed via the o-QDM intermediate. These reactions also proceed with good chemoselectivities, providing new synthetic protocols for motifs found in several bioactive molecules, but are otherwise difficult to access.	0
Title: Analysis of seven genes from the eryAI-eryK region of the erythromycin biosynthetic gene cluster in Saccharopolyspora erythraea Abstract: The gene cluster (ery) governing the biosynthesis of the macrolide antibiotic erythromycin A by Saccharopolyspora erythraea contains, in addition to the eryA genes encoding the polyketide synthase, two regions containing genes for later steps in the pathway. The region 5' of eryA, and lying between eryA and the gene eryK, which is known to encode the C-12 hydroxylase, has been sequenced and shown to contain seven additional open reading frames (ORFs 13-19). On the basis of sequence similarities, roles are proposed for several of these ORFs in the biosynthesis of the deoxysugar mycarose and the deoxyaminosugar desosamine. A chromosomal mutant carrying a deletion in ORF15 has been constructed and shown to accumulate 3-O-mycarosylerythronolide B, as expected for an eryC mutant. Similarly, a chromosomal mutant carrying a deletion in ORF16 has been constructed and shown to accumulate erythronolide B, as expected for an eryB mutant.	1
Title: Relating protein adduction to gene expression changes: a systems approach Abstract: Modification of proteins by reactive electrophiles such as the 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (HNE) plays a critical role in oxidant-associated human diseases. However, little is known about protein adduction and the mechanism by which protein damage elicits adaptive effects and toxicity. We developed a systems approach for relating protein adduction to gene expression changes through the integration of protein adduction, gene expression, protein-DNA interaction, and protein-protein interaction data. Using a random walk strategy, we expanded a list of responsive transcription factors inferred from gene expression studies to upstream signaling networks, which in turn allowed overlaying protein adduction data on the network for the prediction of stress sensors and their associated regulatory mechanisms. We demonstrated the general applicability of transcription factor-based signaling network inference using 103 known pathways. Applying our workflow on gene expression and protein adduction data from HNE-treatment not only rediscovered known mechanisms of electrophile stress but also generated novel hypotheses regarding protein damage sensors. Although developed for analyzing protein adduction data, the framework can be easily adapted for phosphoproteomics and other types of protein modification data.	0
Title: Concise Biosynthesis of Phenylfuropyridones in Fungi Abstract: Phenylfuropyridone natural products from fungi exhibit a range of antibacterial and cytotoxicity activities, and can potentiate azole antifungal compounds. We elucidated the biosynthetic pathway of compounds in the citridone family through heterologous reconstitution of the pfp pathway. We demonstrate that multiple members of this family can be accessed from a reactive ortho-quinone methide (o-QM) intermediate through electrocyclization, cycloisomerization, or conjugate addition. Formation of the quaternary carbon center in citridone B is catalyzed by an epoxide-forming P450 enzyme, followed by carbon skeletal rearrangement. Our results showcase how nature harvests the reactivities of an o-QM intermediate to biosynthesize complex natural products.	1
Title: Co-expression of 15 contiguous genes delineates a fumonisin biosynthetic gene cluster in Gibberella moniliformis Abstract: Fumonisins are mycotoxins produced by the maize pathogen Gibberella moniliformis and are associated with cancer in rodents. In this study, we determined the nucleotide sequence of a 75-kb region of G. moniliformis DNA and identified 18 heretofore undescribed genes flanking a cluster of five previously identified fumonisin biosynthetic (FUM) genes. Ten of the newly identified genes downstream of the cluster were coregulated with FUM genes and exhibited patterns of expression that were correlated with fumonisin production. BLASTX analyses indicated that the predicted functions of proteins encoded by the 10 genes were consistent with activities expected for fumonisin biosynthesis or self-protection. These data indicate that the 10 newly identified genes and the previously identified FUM genes constitute a fumonisin biosynthetic gene cluster. Disruption of two of the new genes, encoding longevity assurance factors, had no apparent effect on fumonisin production, but disruption of a third, encoding an ABC transporter, had a subtle effect on ratios of fumonisins produced.	1
Title: Biosynthesis of Biscognienyne B Involving a Cytochrome P450-Dependent Alkynylation Abstract: The alkyne is a biologically significant moiety found in many natural products and a versatile functional group widely used in modern chemistry. Recent studies have revealed the biosynthesis of acetylenic bonds in fatty acids and amino acids. However, the molecular basis for the alkynyl moiety in acetylenic prenyl chains occurring in a number of meroterpenoids remains obscure. Here, we identify the biosynthetic gene cluster and characterize the biosynthetic pathway of an acetylenic meroterpenoid biscognienyne B based on heterologous expression, feeding experiments, and in vitro assay. This work shows that the alkyne moiety is constructed by an unprecedented cytochrome P450 enzyme BisI, which shows promiscuous activity towards C5 and C15 prenyl chains. This finding provides an opportunity for discovery of new compounds, featuring acetylenic prenyl chains, through genome mining, and it also expands the enzyme inventory for de novo biosynthesis of alkynes.	1
Title: Small-molecule-mediated axonal branching in Caenorhabditis elegans Abstract: An in vivo system for monitoring small-molecule-mediated neuronal branching has been developed by using C. elegans. Growth-promoting compounds can be detected by visual inspection of GFPlabeled cholinergic neurons, as axonal branching occurs following treatment with neurotrophic agents. Investigation of the structure-activity relationship of the neurotrophic natural product clovanemagnolol (1) led us to a comparable chemically edited derivative.	0
Title: Insights from the first putative biosynthetic gene cluster for a lichen depside and depsidone Abstract: The genes for polyketide synthases (PKSs), enzymes that assemble the carbon backbones of many secondary metabolites, often cluster with other secondary pathway genes. We describe here the first lichen PKS cluster likely to be implicated in the biosynthesis of a depside and a depsidone, compounds in a class almost exclusively produced by lichen fungi (mycobionts). With degenerate PCR with primers biased toward presumed PKS genes for depsides and depsidones we identified among the many PKS genes in Cladonia grayi four (CgrPKS13-16) potentially responsible for grayanic acid (GRA), the orcinol depsidone characteristic of this lichen. To single out a likely GRA PKS we compared mRNA and GRA induction in mycobiont cultures using the four candidate PKS genes plus three controls; only CgrPKS16 expression closely matched GRA induction. CgrPKS16 protein domains were compatible with orcinol depside biosynthesis. Phylogenetically CgrPKS16 fell in a new subclade of fungal PKSs uniquely producing orcinol compounds. In the C. grayi genome CgrPKS16 clustered with a CytP450 and an o-methyltransferase gene, appropriately matching the three compounds in the GRA pathway. Induction, domain organization, phylogeny and cluster pathway correspondence independently indicated that the CgrPKS16 cluster is most likely responsible for GRA biosynthesis. Specifically we propose that (i) a single PKS synthesizes two aromatic rings and links them into a depside, (ii) the depside to depsidone transition requires only a cytochrome P450 and (iii) lichen compounds evolved early in the radiation of filamentous fungi.	1
Title: IS1675, a novel lactococcal insertion element, forms a transposon-like structure including the lacticin 481 lantibiotic operon Abstract: Two copies of IS1675, a novel lactococcal insertion element from the IS4 family, are present on a 70-kb plasmid, where they frame the lantibiotic lacticin 481 operon. The whole structure could be a composite transposon designated Tn5721. This study shows that the lacticin 481 operon does not include any regulatory gene and provides a new example of a transposon-associated bacteriocin determinant. We identified five other IS1675 copies not associated with the lacticin 481 operon. The conservation of IS1675 flanking sequences suggested a 24-bp target site.	1
Title: Terminal alkene formation by the thioesterase of curacin A biosynthesis: structure of a decarboxylating thioesterase Abstract: Curacin A is a polyketide synthase (PKS)-non-ribosomal peptide synthetase-derived natural product with potent anticancer properties generated by the marine cyanobacterium Lyngbya majuscula. Type I modular PKS assembly lines typically employ a thioesterase (TE) domain to off-load carboxylic acid or macrolactone products from an adjacent acyl carrier protein (ACP) domain. In a striking departure from this scheme the curacin A PKS employs tandem sulfotransferase and TE domains to form a terminal alkene moiety. Sulfotransferase sulfonation of β-hydroxy-acyl-ACP is followed by TE hydrolysis, decarboxylation, and sulfate elimination (Gu, L., Wang, B., Kulkarni, A., Gehret, J. J., Lloyd, K. R., Gerwick, L., Gerwick, W. H., Wipf, P., Håkansson, K., Smith, J. L., and Sherman, D. H. (2009) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 131, 16033-16035). With low sequence identity to other PKS TEs (<15%), the curacin TE represents a new thioesterase subfamily. The 1.7-Å curacin TE crystal structure reveals how the familiar α/β-hydrolase architecture is adapted to specificity for β-sulfated substrates. A Ser-His-Glu catalytic triad is centered in an open active site cleft between the core domain and a lid subdomain. Unlike TEs from other PKSs, the lid is fixed in an open conformation on one side by dimer contacts of a protruding helix and on the other side by an arginine anchor from the lid into the core. Adjacent to the catalytic triad, another arginine residue is positioned to recognize the substrate β-sulfate group. The essential features of the curacin TE are conserved in sequences of five other putative bacterial ACP-ST-TE tridomains. Formation of a sulfate leaving group as a biosynthetic strategy to facilitate acyl chain decarboxylation is of potential value as a route to hydrocarbon biofuels.	1
Title: The yersiniabactin biosynthetic gene cluster of Yersinia enterocolitica: organization and siderophore-dependent regulation Abstract: The ability to synthesize and uptake the Yersinia siderophore yersiniabactin is a hallmark of the highly pathogenic, mouse-lethal species Yersinia pestis, Y. pseudotuberculosis, and Y. enterocolitica 1B. We have identified four genes, irp1, irp3, irp4, and irp5, on a 13-kb chromosomal DNA fragment of Y. enterocolitica 08, WA-314. These genes constitute the yersiniabactin biosynthetic gene cluster together with the previously defined irp2. The irp1 gene consists of 9,486 bp capable of encoding a 3,161-amino-acid high-molecular-weight protein 1 (HMWP1) polypeptide with a predicted mass of 384.6 kDa. The first 3,000 bp of irp1 show similarity to the corresponding regions of the polyketide synthase genes of Bacillus subtilis and Streptomyces antibioticus. The remaining part of irp1 is most similar to irp2, encoding HMWP2, which might be the reason for immunological cross-reactivity of the two polypeptides. Irp4 was found to have 41.7% similarity to thioesterase-like protein of the anguibactin biosynthetic genes of Vibrio anguillarum. Irp5 shows 41% similarity to EntE, the 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid-activating enzyme utilized in enterobactin synthesis of Escherichia coli. Irp4 and Irp5 are nearly identical to YbtT and YbtE, recently identified in Y. pestis. irp3 has no similarity to any known gene. Inactivation of either irp1 or irp2 abrogates yersiniabactin synthesis. Mutations in irp1 or fyuA (encoding yersiniabactin/pesticin receptor) result in downregulation of irp2 that can be upregulated by the addition of yersiniabactin. A FyuA-green fluorescent protein translational fusion was downregulated in an irp1 mutant. Upregulation was achieved by addition of yersiniabactin but not desferal, pesticin, or pyochelin, which indicates high specificity of the FyuA receptor and autoregulation of genes involved in synthesis and uptake of yersiniabactin.	1
Title: Environmental influences on competitive hydrogen peroxide production in Streptococcus gordonii Abstract: Streptococcus gordonii is an important member of the oral biofilm. One of its phenotypic traits is the production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). H2O2 is an antimicrobial component produced by S. gordonii that is able to antagonize the growth of cariogenic Streptococcus mutans. Strategies that modulate H2O2 production in the oral cavity may be useful as a simple therapeutic mechanism to improve oral health, but little is known about the regulation of H2O2 production. The enzyme responsible for H2O2 production is pyruvate oxidase, encoded by spxB. The functional studies of spxB expression and SpxB abundance presented in this report demonstrate a strong dependence on environmental oxygen tension and carbohydrate availability. Carbon catabolite repression (CCR) modulates spxB expression carbohydrate dependently. Catabolite control protein A (CcpA) represses spxB expression by direct binding to the spxB promoter, as shown by electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA). Promoter mutation studies revealed the requirement of two catabolite-responsive elements (CRE) for CcpA-dependent spxB regulation, as evaluated by spxB expression and phenotypic H2O2 production assays. Thus, molecular mechanisms for the control of S. gordonii spxB expression are presented for the first time, demonstrating the possibility of manipulating H2O2 production for increased competitive fitness.	0
Title: Metagenomic discovery of polybrominated diphenyl ether biosynthesis by marine sponges Abstract: Naturally produced polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) pervade the marine environment and structurally resemble toxic man-made brominated flame retardants. PBDEs bioaccumulate in marine animals and are likely transferred to the human food chain. However, the biogenic basis for PBDE production in one of their most prolific sources, marine sponges of the order Dysideidae, remains unidentified. Here, we report the discovery of PBDE biosynthetic gene clusters within sponge-microbiome-associated cyanobacterial endosymbionts through the use of an unbiased metagenome-mining approach. Using expression of PBDE biosynthetic genes in heterologous cyanobacterial hosts, we correlate the structural diversity of naturally produced PBDEs to modifications within PBDE biosynthetic gene clusters in multiple sponge holobionts. Our results establish the genetic and molecular foundation for the production of PBDEs in one of the most abundant natural sources of these molecules, further setting the stage for a metagenomic-based inventory of other PBDE sources in the marine environment.	1
Title: Characterization of the Antimicrobial Peptide Penisin, a Class Ia Novel Lantibiotic from Paenibacillus sp. Strain A3 Abstract: Attempts to isolate novel antimicrobial peptides from microbial sources have been on the rise recently, despite their low efficacy in therapeutic applications. Here, we report identification and characterization of a new efficient antimicrobial peptide from a bacterial strain designated A3 that exhibited highest identity with Paenibacillus ehimensis. Upon purification and subsequent molecular characterization of the antimicrobial peptide, referred to as penisin, we found the peptide to be a bacteriocin-like peptide. Consistent with these results, RAST analysis of the entire genome sequence revealed the presence of a lantibiotic gene cluster containing genes necessary for synthesis and maturation of a lantibiotic. While circular dichroism and one-dimension nuclear magnetic resonance experiments confirmed a random coil structure of the peptide, similar to other known lantibiotics, additional biochemical evidence suggests posttranslational modifications of the core peptide yield six thioether cross-links. The deduced amino acid sequence of the putative biosynthetic gene penA showed approximately 74% similarity with elgicin A and 50% similarity with the lantibiotic paenicidin A. Penisin effectively killed methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and did not exhibit hemolysis activity. Unlike other lantibiotics, it effectively inhibited the growth of Gram-negative bacteria. Furthermore, 80 mg/kg of body weight of penisin significantly reduced bacterial burden in a mouse thigh infection model and protected BALB/c mice in a bacteremia model entailing infection with Staphylococcus aureus MTCC 96, suggesting that it could be a promising new antimicrobial peptide.	1
Title: Discovery and Biosynthesis of the Antibiotic Bicyclomycin in Distantly Related Bacterial Classes Abstract: Bicyclomycin (BCM) is a clinically promising antibiotic that is biosynthesized by Streptomyces cinnamoneus DSM 41675. BCM is structurally characterized by a core cyclo(l-Ile-l-Leu) 2,5-diketopiperazine (DKP) that is extensively oxidized. Here, we identify the BCM biosynthetic gene cluster, which shows that the core of BCM is biosynthesized by a cyclodipeptide synthase, and the oxidative modifications are introduced by five 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases and one cytochrome P450 monooxygenase. The discovery of the gene cluster enabled the identification of BCM pathways encoded by the genomes of hundreds of Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates distributed globally, and heterologous expression of the pathway from P. aeruginosa SCV20265 demonstrated that the product is chemically identical to BCM produced by S. cinnamoneus Overall, putative BCM gene clusters have been found in at least seven genera spanning Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria (Alphaproteobacteria, Betaproteobacteria, and Gammaproteobacteria). This represents a rare example of horizontal gene transfer of an intact biosynthetic gene cluster across such distantly related bacteria, and we show that these gene clusters are almost always associated with mobile genetic elements.IMPORTANCE Bicyclomycin is the only natural product antibiotic that selectively inhibits the transcription termination factor Rho. This mechanism of action, combined with its proven biological safety and its activity against clinically relevant Gram-negative bacterial pathogens, makes it a very promising antibiotic candidate. Here, we report the identification of the bicyclomycin biosynthetic gene cluster in the known bicyclomycin-producing organism Streptomyces cinnamoneus, which will enable the engineered production of new bicyclomycin derivatives. The identification of this gene cluster also led to the discovery of hundreds of bicyclomycin pathways encoded in highly diverse bacteria, including in the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa This wide distribution of a complex biosynthetic pathway is very unusual and provides an insight into how a pathway for an antibiotic can be transferred between diverse bacteria.	1
Title: Cystomanamides: structure and biosynthetic pathway of a family of glycosylated lipopeptides from myxobacteria Abstract: Cystomanamides A-D were isolated as novel natural product scaffolds from Cystobacter fuscus MCy9118, and their structures were established by spectroscopic techniques including 2D NMR, LC-SPE-NMR/-MS, and HR-MS. The cystomanamides contain β-hydroxy amino acids along with 3-amino-9-methyldecanoic acid that is N-glycosylated in cystomanamide C and D. The gene cluster for cystomanamide biosynthesis was identified by gene disruption as PKS/NRPS hybrid incorporating an iso-fatty acid as starter unit and including a reductive amination step at the interface of the PKS and NRPS modules.	1
Title: Hybrid Transcription Factor Engineering Activates the Silent Secondary Metabolite Gene Cluster for (+)-Asperlin in Aspergillus nidulans Abstract: Fungi are a major source of valuable bioactive secondary metabolites (SMs). These compounds are synthesized by enzymes encoded by genes that are clustered in the genome. The vast majority of SM biosynthetic gene clusters are not expressed under normal growth conditions, and their products are unknown. Developing methods for activation of these silent gene clusters offers the potential for discovering many valuable new fungal SMs. While a number of useful approaches have been developed, they each have limitations, and additional tools are needed. One approach, upregulation of SM gene cluster-specific transcription factors that are associated with many SM gene clusters, has worked extremely well in some cases, but it has failed more often than it has succeeded. Taking advantage of transcription factor domain modularity, we developed a new approach. We fused the DNA-binding domain of a transcription factor associated with a silent SM gene cluster with the activation domain of a robust SM transcription factor, AfoA. Expression of this hybrid transcription factor activated transcription of the genes in the target cluster and production of the antibiotic (+)-asperlin. Deletion of cluster genes confirmed that the cluster is responsible for (+)-asperlin production, and we designate it the aln cluster. Separately, coinduction of expression of two aln cluster genes revealed the pathway intermediate (2 Z,4 Z,6 E)-octa-2,4,6-trienoic acid, a compound with photoprotectant properties. Our findings demonstrate the potential of our novel synthetic hybrid transcription factor strategy to discover the products of other silent fungal SM gene clusters.	1
Title: Purification and functional characterization of phiX174 lysis protein E Abstract: Two classes of bacteriophages, the single-stranded DNA Microviridae and the single-stranded RNA Alloleviviridae, accomplish lysis by expressing "protein antibiotics", or polypeptides that inhibit cell wall biosynthesis. Previously, we have provided genetic and physiological evidence that E, a 91-amino acid membrane protein encoded by the prototype microvirus, varphiX174, is a specific inhibitor of the translocase MraY, an essential membrane-embedded enzyme that catalyzes the formation of the murein precursor, Lipid I, from UDP-N-acetylmuramic acid-pentapeptide and the lipid carrier, undecaprenol phosphate. Here we report the first purification of E, which has been refractory to overexpression because of its lethality to Escherichia coli. Moreover, using a fluorescently labeled analogue of the sugar-nucleotide substrate, we demonstrate that E acts as a noncompetitive inhibitor of detergent-solubilized MraY, with respect to both soluble and lipid substrates. In addition, we show that the E sensitivity of five MraY mutant proteins, produced from alleles selected for resistance to E, can be correlated to the apparent affinities determined by in vivo multicopy suppression experiments. These results are inconsistent with previous reports that E inhibited membrane-embedded MraY but not the detergent-solubilized enzyme, which led to a model in which E functions by binding MraY and blocking the formation of an essential heteromultimeric complex involving MraY and other murein biosynthesis enzymes. We discuss a new model in which E binds to MraY at a site composed of the two transmembrane domains within which the E resistance mutations map and the fact that the result of this binding is a conformational change that inactivates the enzyme.	0
Title: Synthesis of (+)- and (-)-monanchorin Abstract: The optically pure epoxy acetal was converted to the protected guanidino alcohol by reaction with NaN(3) in DMF, hydrogenation of the azide, and reaction of the amine with MeSC(NBoc)NHBoc, AgNO(3), and Et(3)N. Treatment of the protected guanidino alcohol with 9:1 CDCl(3)/TFA afforded monanchorin, whose absolute stereochemistry was assigned as shown.	0
Title: Iteratively acting glycosyltransferases involved in the hexasaccharide biosynthesis of landomycin A Abstract: Detailed studies on the biosynthesis of the hexasaccharide side chain of landomycin A, produced by S. cyanogenus S136, revealed the function of each glycosyltransferase gene of the biosynthetic gene cluster. Analyses of generated mutants as well as feeding experiments allowed us to determine that LanGT2 and LanGT3 catalyze the attachment of one sugar, whereas LanGT1 and LanGT4 attach two sugars during landomycin A biosynthesis. The generation of a lanZ2 deletion mutant provided evidence that LanZ2 is controlling the elongation of the saccharide side chain.	1
Title: WdChs1p, a class II chitin synthase, is more responsible than WdChs2p (Class I) for normal yeast reproductive growth in the polymorphic, pathogenic fungus Wangiella (Exophiala) dermatitidis Abstract: The chitin synthase gene WdCHS1 was isolated from a partial genomic DNA library of the pathogenic polymorphic fungus Wangiella dermatitidis. Sequencing showed that WdCHS1 encoded a class II chitin synthase composed of 988 amino acids. Disruption of WdCHS1 produced strains that were hyperpigmented in rich media, grew as yeast at wild-type rates at both 25 and 37 degrees C and were as virulent as the wild type in a mouse model. However, detailed morphological and cytological studies of the wdchs1Delta mutants showed that yeast cells often failed to separate, tended to be enriched with chitin in septal regions and, sometimes, were enlarged with multiple nuclei, had broader mother cell-daughter bud regions and had other cell wall defects seen considerably less often than in the wild type or wdchs2 Delta strains. Disruption of WdCHS1 and WdCHS2 in the same background revealed that WdChs1p had functions synergistic to those of WdChs2p, because mutants devoid of both isozymes produced growth that was very abnormal at 25 degrees C and was not viable at 37 degrees C unless osmotically stabilized. These results suggested that WdChs1p was more responsible than WdChs2p for normal yeast cell reproductive growth because strains with defects in the latter exhibited no morphological abnormalities, whereas those with defects in WdChs1p were frequently impaired in one or more yeast developmental processes.	0
Title: Modulating the electron-transfer properties of a mixed-valence system through host-guest chemistry Abstract: Metal directed self-assembly has become a much-studied route towards complex molecular architectures. Although studies on mixed valence, MV, systems accessible through this approach are almost non-existent, the potential applications of such systems are very exciting as MV states provide the basis of a number of molecular-scale devices, including single electron wires and switches. Furthermore, while many novel hosts for guest ions and molecules have been developed through metal directed self-assembly, as these products tend to be kinetically labile, very few electrochemical studies have been reported. Herein, we report that the interplay between the binding properties and redox activity of a self-assembled trinuclear RuII macrocycle leads to an hitherto unreported phenomenon, in which access to specific MV states can be gated by host-guest chemistry. Thus, this system is the first in which MV states and the extent of electron delocalisation are switched by an ion without any change in electrochemical potential.	0
Title: Identification of a gene required for the terminal step in erythromycin A biosynthesis in Saccharopolyspora erythraea (Streptomyces erythreus) Abstract: We have identified a transcription unit in the ermE region of the chromosome of the erythromycin (Er)-producing bacterium Saccharopolyspora erythraea (Streptomyces erythreus) that is briefly switched on at about the time that macrolide production commences. Disruption of the transcription unit, herein designated eryG, by insertion of an integrational plasmid vector, caused a block at the terminal step in the biosynthesis of erythromycin, the conversion of erythromycin C to A by O-methylation.	1
Title: Molecular basis for mycophenolic acid biosynthesis in Penicillium brevicompactum Abstract: Mycophenolic acid (MPA) is the active ingredient in the increasingly important immunosuppressive pharmaceuticals CellCept (Roche) and Myfortic (Novartis). Despite the long history of MPA, the molecular basis for its biosynthesis has remained enigmatic. Here we report the discovery of a polyketide synthase (PKS), MpaC, which we successfully characterized and identified as responsible for MPA production in Penicillium brevicompactum. mpaC resides in what most likely is a 25-kb gene cluster in the genome of Penicillium brevicompactum. The gene cluster was successfully localized by targeting putative resistance genes, in this case an additional copy of the gene encoding IMP dehydrogenase (IMPDH). We report the cloning, sequencing, and the functional characterization of the MPA biosynthesis gene cluster by deletion of the polyketide synthase gene mpaC of P. brevicompactum and bioinformatic analyses. As expected, the gene deletion completely abolished MPA production as well as production of several other metabolites derived from the MPA biosynthesis pathway of P. brevicompactum. Our work sets the stage for engineering the production of MPA and analogues through metabolic engineering.	1
Title: Genetic elucidation of interconnected antibiotic pathways mediating maize innate immunity Abstract: Specialized metabolites constitute key layers of immunity that underlie disease resistance in crops; however, challenges in resolving pathways limit our understanding of the functions and applications of these metabolites. In maize (Zea mays), the inducible accumulation of acidic terpenoids is increasingly considered to be a defence mechanism that contributes to disease resistance. Here, to understand maize antibiotic biosynthesis, we integrated association mapping, pan-genome multi-omic correlations, enzyme structure-function studies and targeted mutagenesis. We define ten genes in three zealexin (Zx) gene clusters that encode four sesquiterpene synthases and six cytochrome P450 proteins that collectively drive the production of diverse antibiotic cocktails. Quadruple mutants in which the ability to produce zealexins (ZXs) is blocked exhibit a broad-spectrum loss of disease resistance. Genetic redundancies ensuring pathway resiliency to single null mutations are combined with enzyme substrate promiscuity, creating a biosynthetic hourglass pathway that uses diverse substrates and in vivo combinatorial chemistry to yield complex antibiotic blends. The elucidated genetic basis of biochemical phenotypes that underlie disease resistance demonstrates a predominant maize defence pathway and informs innovative strategies for transferring chemical immunity between crops.	1
Title: Fluorescent Probes with Unnatural Amino Acids to Monitor Proteasome Activity in Real-Time Abstract: The proteasome is an essential protein complex that, when dysregulated, can result in various diseases in eukaryotic cells. As such, understanding the enzymatic activity of the proteasome and what can alter it is crucial to elucidating its roles in these diseases. This can be done effectively by using activity-based fluorescent substrate probes, of which there are many commercially available that target the individual protease-like subunits in the 20S CP of the proteasome. Unfortunately, these probes have not displayed appropriate characteristics for their use in live cell-based assays. In the work presented here, we have developed a set of probes which have shown improved fluorescence properties and selectivity toward the proteasome compared to other cellular proteases. By including unnatural amino acids, we have found probes which can be utilized in various applications, including monitoring the effects of small molecule stimulators of the proteasome in live cells and comparing the relative proteasome activity across different cancer cell types. In future studies, we expect the fluorescent probes presented here will serve as tools to support the discovery and characterization of small molecule modulators of proteasome activity.	0
Title: Function of the outer membrane of Escherichia coli as a permeability barrier to beta-lactam antibiotics Abstract: On the basis of a simple theoretical model, the ease of penetration of beta-lactam antibiotics through the outer membrane of Escherichia coli was measured. The cell envelope was found to act as a diffusion barrier to both penicillins and cephalosporins. The validity of the model and the cooperative action of cell-bound beta-lactamase and outer membrane were further verified by comparing calculated and experimentally determined velocities of beta-lactam hydrolysis by intact cells and sonically treated cell suspensions. The results showed good correspondence at five different antibiotic concentrations. Similar conclusions could be drawn from a comparison of beta-lactam concentrations on both sides of the outer membrane, calculated from enzyme kinetic measurements and minimal inhibitory concentrations for both a beta-lactamase-producing E. coli and its enzyme-negative variant. in the case of benzylpenicillin and cephalothin, however, no correspondence was found. The joint action of several parameters determining the efficacy of penicillins and cephalosporins against beta-lactamase-producing E. coli is discussed.	0
Title: Base modification strategies to modulate immune stimulation by an siRNA Abstract: Immune stimulation triggered by siRNAs is one of the major challenges in the development of safe RNAi-based therapeutics. Within an immunostimulatory siRNA sequence, this hurdle is commonly addressed by using ribose modifications (e.g., 2'-OMe or 2'-F), which results in decreased cytokine production. However, as immune stimulation by siRNAs is a sequence-dependent phenomenon, recognition of the nucleobases by the trigger receptor(s) is also likely. Here, we use the recently published crystal structures of Toll-like receptor 8 (TLR8) bound to small-molecule agonists to generate computational models for ribonucleotide binding by this immune receptor. Our modeling suggested that modification of either the Watson-Crick or Hoogsteen face of adenosine would disrupt nucleotide/TLR8 interactions. We employed chemical synthesis to alter either the Watson-Crick or Hoogsteen face of adenosine and evaluated the effect of these modifications in an siRNA guide strand by measuring the immunostimulatory and RNA interference properties. For the siRNA guide strand tested, we found that modifying the Watson-Crick face is generally more effective at blocking TNFα production in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) than modification at the Hoogsteen edge. We also observed that modifications near the 5'-end were more effective at blocking cytokine production than those placed at the 3'-end. This work advances our understanding of how chemical modifications can be used to optimize siRNA performance.	0
Title: The natural products beauveriolide I and III: a new class of beta-amyloid-lowering compounds Abstract: Attacking Alzheimer's by ACAT: The aggregation of beta-amyloid peptides, especially Abeta(42), into senile plaques is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We show that the fungal natural products beauveriolides I and III can potently decrease Abeta secretion from cells expressing human amyloid precursor protein; this offers a potential new scaffold for the development of compounds with proven bioavailability for the treatment of AD.	0
Title: Identification of three complementation units in the gerA spore germination locus of Bacillus subtilis Abstract: The gerA locus, mutations in which affect the germination response of spores to L-alanine and related amino acids, is contained within a 6-kilobase region of DNA cloned in phage and plasmid vectors. Fragments from this region, subcloned in the shuttle vector pHV33, were introduced into Bacillus subtilis, and their ability to complement chromosomal gerA mutations in a recE4 background was examined. Although the plasmids were somewhat unstable, it was possible to score complementation within spore-containing colonies on nutrient agar by their ability to reduce 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride in an overlay. These studies have assigned the 10 gerA mutations tested to three complementation groups. An analysis of Tn1000 insertions into the cloned DNA of two relatively stable plasmids that together encompass the entire gerA region has identified more precisely the location and extent of the complementation units; recombination studies and in vitro mutagenesis were used to further delineate the extents of two of the units. The evidence suggests that the three complementation units are adjacent and that they are probably capable of separate transcription.	0
Title: Synthesis and application in polypropylene of a novel of phosphorus-containing intumescent flame retardant Abstract: A novel phosphorus-containing triazine oligomer poly(2-morpholinyl-4-penta-erythritol phosphate-1,3,5-triazine) (PMPT) was synthesized as a kind of tri-component intumescent flame retardant (IFR). The chemical structure of PMPT was characterized by FTIR, 1H-NMR and 31P-NMR, and the mechanical and flammability properties of FR-PP were measured. The FTIR results showed that the expected chemical reactions had happened at each step. The 1H-NMR and 31P-NMR spectra also agreed with the chemical structure of PMPT. The slight effect of PMPT on the mechanical properties of FR-PP suggested that PMPT and PP are compatible. The high limited oxygen index (LOI) values of FR-PP revealed that PMPT was an efficient IFR and there was the synergistic effect between PMPT and ammonium polyphosphate/ pentaerythritol (APP/PER).	0
Title: Size series of small indium arsenide-zinc selenide core-shell nanocrystals and their application to in vivo imaging Abstract: We have developed a size series of unusually small, water-soluble (InAs)ZnSe (core)shell quantum dots (QDs) that emit in the near-infrared and exhibit new behavior in vivo, including multiple sequential lymph node mapping and extravasation from the vasculature. The biological utility of these fluorescent probes resulted from our intentional choice to match the semiconductor material and water-soluble ligand with a desired final hydrodynamic diameter and emission wavelength.	0
Title: Phosphotransfer and CheY-binding domains of the histidine autokinase CheA are joined by a flexible linker Abstract: Multidimensional heteronuclear NMR techniques were applied to study a protein fragment of the histidine autokinase CheA from Escherichia coli. This fragment (CheA1-233) contains the phosphotransfer domain and the CheY-binding domain joined by a linker region. Comparison of chemical shift and NOE cross-peak patterns indicates that the structures of the two domains in CheA1-233 remain nearly the same as in the two individual domain fragments, CheA1-134 and CheA124-257. Relaxation properties of the backbone 15N nuclei were measured to study the rotational correlations of the two domains and properties of the linker region. Dynamics data were analyzed both by an isotropic motional model and an anisotropic motional model. The experimental T1 and T2 values, the derived rotational correlation times, and motional anisotropy are significantly different for the two domains, indicating the two domains reorient independently and the linker region is highly flexible. Dynamics data of CheA1-233 were also compared with those of CheA1-134. Our studies show that flexible domain linkers and extended and flexible terminal polypeptide chains can have significant effects on the motional properties of the adjacent structured regions. These observations suggest a model for the graded regulation of CheA autophosphorylation activity. In this model, the various activity states of the receptor are generated by controlling the access of the mean position of the kinase domain to the phosphotransfer domain. This would then modulate the diffusional encounter rate of the domains and hence activity over a wide and graded range of values.	0
Title: The N-terminal region of the Neurospora NDR kinase COT1 regulates morphology via its interactions with MOB2A/B Abstract: Nuclear Dbf2p-related (NDR) protein kinases are important for cell differentiation and polar morphogenesis in various organisms, yet some of their functions are still elusive. Dysfunction of the Neurospora crassa NDR kinase COT1 leads to cessation of tip extension and hyperbranching. NDR kinases require the physical interaction between the kinase's N-terminal region (NTR) and the MPS1-binding (MOB) proteins for their activity and functions. To study the interactions between COT1 and MOB2 proteins, we mutated several conserved residues and a novel phosphorylation site within the COT1 NTR. The phenotypes of these mutants suggest that the NTR is required for COT1 functions in regulating hyphal elongation and branching, asexual conidiation and germination. Interestingly, while both MOB2A and MOB2B promote proper hyphal growth, they have distinct COT1-dependent roles in regulation of macroconidiation. Immunoprecipitation experiments indicate physical association of COT1 with both MOB2A and MOB2B, simultaneously. Furthermore, the binding of the two MOB2 proteins to COT1 is mediated by different residues at the COT1 NTR, suggesting a hetero-trimer is formed. Thus, although MOB2A/B may have some overlapping functions in regulating hyphal tip extension, their function is not redundant and they are both required for proper fungal development.	0
Title: Purification and characterization of antimicrobial peptides from fish isolate Carnobacterium maltaromaticum C2: Carnobacteriocin X and carnolysins A1 and A2 Abstract: Carnobacterium maltaromaticum C2, isolated from Brazilian smoked fish (Surubim, Pseudoplatystoma sp.), was found to exert antimicrobial activity against Listeria monocytogenes, an important foodborne pathogen. In this study, the bacteriocins produced by C. maltaromaticum C2 were purified via an extraction with XAD-16 resin, a C18 solid phase extraction, followed by reversed-phase fast protein liquid chromatography. The purified active fractions were characterized using tandem mass spectrometry, permitting the identification of multiple bacteriocins. Carnobacteriocins BM1, B1, and a variant of carnobacteriocin B2 were all found, providing much of the antilisterial activity. Additionally, we herein report the first isolation of the previously predicted antimicrobial peptide carnobacteriocin X. Moreover, C. maltaromaticum C2 produces a novel two-component lantibiotic, termed carnolysin, homologous to enterococcal cytolysin. This lantibiotic is antimicrobially inactive when tested against the non-bacteriocinogenic strain C. maltaromaticum A9b-, likely requiring an additional proteolytic cleavage to reach maturity.	1
Title: The Edwardsiella ictaluri O polysaccharide biosynthesis gene cluster and the role of O polysaccharide in resistance to normal catfish serum and catfish neutrophils Abstract: Edwardsiella ictaluri, the causative agent of enteric septicaemia of catfish (ESC), expresses long O polysaccharide (OPS) chains on its surface. The authors previously reported the construction of an isogenic Ed. ictaluri OPS mutant strain and demonstrated that this strain is avirulent in channel catfish. This paper reports the cloning of the Ed. ictaluri OPS biosynthesis gene cluster and identification of the mutated gene in the OPS-negative strain. The sequenced region contains eight complete ORFs and one incomplete ORF encoding LPS biosynthesis enzymes. The mutated gene (designated wbiT) was similar to other bacterial galactose-4-epimerases. Glycosyl composition analysis indicated that wild-type Ed. ictaluri OPS contains higher amounts of galactose and N-acetylgalactosamine than the OPS mutant strain, which correlated well with predicted functions of the genes identified in the OPS biosynthesis cluster. The OPS mutant had a relatively small, but significant, decrease in its ability to survive in normal catfish serum compared to wild-type Ed. ictaluri, but it retained the ability to resist killing by catfish neutrophils.	1

Strain ATCC-PTA-5024, Producing the Lantibiotic NAI-107 Abstract: We report the draft genome sequence of Microbispora sp. strain ATCC-PTA-5024, a soil isolate that produces NAI-107, a new lantibiotic with the potential to treat life-threatening infections caused by multidrug-resistant Gram-positive pathogens. The draft genome of strain Microbispora sp. ATCC-PTA-5024 consists of 8,543,819 bp, with a 71.2% G+C content and 7,860 protein-coding genes.	1
Title: Genetic organization of chromosomal S-layer glycan biosynthesis loci of Bacillaceae Abstract: S-layer glycoproteins are cell surface glycoconjugates that have been identified in archaea and in bacteria. Usually, S-layer glycoproteins assemble into regular, crystalline arrays covering the entire bacterium. Our research focuses on thermophilic Bacillaceae, which are considered a suitable model system for studying bacterial glycosylation. During the past decade, investigations of S-layer glycoproteins dealt with the elucidation of the highly variable glycan structures by a combination of chemical degradation methods and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. It was only recently that the molecular characterization of the genes governing the formation of the S-layer glycoprotein glycan chains has been initiated. The S-layer glycosylation (slg) gene clusters of four of the 11 known S-layer glycan structures from members of the Bacillaceae have now been studied. The clusters are approximately 16 to approximately 25 kb in size and transcribed as polycistronic units. They include nucleotide sugar pathway genes that are arranged as operons, sugar transferase genes, glycan processing genes, and transporter genes. So far, the biochemical functions only of the genes required for nucleotide sugar biosynthesis have been demonstrated experimentally. The presence of insertion sequences and the decrease of the G + C content at the slg locus suggest that the investigated organisms have acquired their specific S-layer glycosylation potential by lateral gene transfer. In addition, S-layer protein glycosylation requires the participation of housekeeping genes that map outside the cluster. The gene encoding the respective S-layer target protein is transcribed monocistronically and independently of the slg cluster genes. Its chromosomal location is not necessarily in close vicinity to the slg gene cluster.	1
Title: The mitochondrion as janus bifrons Abstract: The signaling function of mitochondria is considered with a special emphasis on their role in the regulation of redox status of the cell, possibly determining a number of pathologies including cancer and aging. The review summarizes the transport role of mitochondria in energy supply to all cellular compartments (mitochondria as an electric cable in the cell), the role of mitochondria in plastic metabolism of the cell including synthesis of heme, steroids, iron-sulfur clusters, and reactive oxygen and nitrogen species. Mitochondria also play an important role in the Ca(2+)-signaling and the regulation of apoptotic cell death. Knowledge of mechanisms responsible for apoptotic cell death is important for the strategy for prevention of unwanted degradation of postmitotic cells such as cardiomyocytes and neurons.	0
Title: Identification of the Biosynthetic Gene Cluster for the Organoarsenical Antibiotic Arsinothricin Abstract: The soil bacterium Burkholderia gladioli GSRB05 produces the natural compound arsinothricin [2-amino-4-(hydroxymethylarsinoyl) butanoate] (AST), which has been demonstrated to be a broad-spectrum antibiotic. To identify the genes responsible for AST biosynthesis, a draft genome sequence of B. gladioli GSRB05 was constructed. Three genes, arsQML, in an arsenic resistance operon were found to be a biosynthetic gene cluster responsible for synthesis of AST and its precursor, hydroxyarsinothricin [2-amino-4-(dihydroxyarsinoyl) butanoate] (AST-OH). The arsL gene product is a noncanonical radical S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) enzyme that is predicted to transfer the 3-amino-3-carboxypropyl (ACP) group from SAM to the arsenic atom in inorganic arsenite, forming AST-OH, which is methylated by the arsM gene product, a SAM methyltransferase, to produce AST. Finally, the arsQ gene product is an efflux permease that extrudes AST from the cells, a common final step in antibiotic-producing bacteria. Elucidation of the biosynthetic gene cluster for this novel arsenic-containing antibiotic adds an important new tool for continuation of the antibiotic era. IMPORTANCE Antimicrobial resistance is an emerging global public health crisis, calling for urgent development of novel potent antibiotics. We propose that arsinothricin and related arsenic-containing compounds may be the progenitors of a new class of antibiotics to extend our antibiotic era. Here, we report identification of the biosynthetic gene cluster for arsinothricin and demonstrate that only three genes, two of which are novel, are required for the biosynthesis and transport of arsinothricin, in contrast to the phosphonate counterpart, phosphinothricin, which requires over 20 genes. Our discoveries will provide insight for the development of more effective organoarsenical antibiotics and illustrate the previously unknown complexity of the arsenic biogeochemical cycle, as well as bring new perspective to environmental arsenic biochemistry.	1
Title: Cloning and characterization of a cyclic peptide synthetase gene from Alternaria alternata apple pathotype whose product is involved in AM-toxin synthesis and pathogenicity Abstract: Afternaria afternata apple pathotype causes Alternaria blotch of susceptible apple cultivars through the production of a cyclic peptide host-specific toxin, AM-toxin. PCR (polymerase chain reaction), with primers designed to conserved domains of peptide synthetase genes, amplified several products from A. alternata apple pathotype that showed high similarity to other fungal peptide synthetases and were specific to the apple pathotype. Screening of a Lambda Zap genomic library with these PCR-generated probes identified overlapping clones containing a complete cyclic peptide synthetase gene of 13.1 kb in length with no introns. Disruption of this gene, designated AM-toxin synthetase (AMT), by transformation of wild-type A. afternata apple pathotype with disruption vectors resulted in toxin-minus mutants, which were also unable to cause disease symptoms on susceptible apple cultivars. AM-toxin synthetase is therefore a primary determinant of virulence and specificity in the A. alternata apple pathotype/apple interaction.	1
Title: N-Acetyl-Cysteinylated Streptophenazines from Streptomyces Abstract: Here, we describe two N-acetyl-cysteinylated streptophenazines (1 and 2) produced by the soil-derived Streptomyces sp. ID63040 and identified through a metabolomic approach. These metabolites attracted our interest due to their low occurrence frequency in a large library of fermentation broth extracts and their consistent presence in biological replicates of the producer strain. The compounds were found to possess broad-spectrum antibacterial activity while exhibiting low cytotoxicity. The biosynthetic gene cluster from Streptomyces sp. ID63040 was found to be highly similar to the streptophenazine reference cluster in the MIBiG database, which originates from the marine Streptomyces sp. CNB-091. Compounds 1 and 2 were the main streptophenazine products from Streptomyces sp. ID63040 at all cultivation times but were not detected in Streptomyces sp. CNB-091. The lack of obvious candidates for cysteinylation in the Streptomyces sp. ID63040 biosynthetic gene cluster suggests that the N-acetyl-cysteine moiety derives from cellular functions, most likely from mycothiol. Overall, our data represent an interesting example of how to leverage metabolomics for the discovery of new natural products and point out the often-neglected contribution of house-keeping cellular functions to natural product diversification.	1
Title: Structure of the low-affinity penicillin-binding protein 5 PBP5fm in wild-type and highly penicillin-resistant strains of Enterococcus faecium Abstract: Among its penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs), Enterococcus faecium possesses a low-affinity PBP5, PBP5fm, which is the main target involved in beta-lactam resistance. A 7.7-kb EcoRI chromosomal fragment of E. faecium D63r containing the pbp5fm gene was cloned and sequenced. Two open reading frames (ORFs) were found. A 2,037-bp ORF encoded the deduced 73.8-kDa PBP5fm, the amino acid sequences of which were, respectively, 99.8, 78.5, and 62% homologous to those of the low-affinity plasmid-encoded PBP3r of Enterococcus hirae S185r and the chromosome-encoded PBP5 of E. hirae R40 and Enterococcus faecalis 56R. A second 597-bp ORF, designated psrfm, was found 2.3 kb upstream of pbp5fm. It appeared to be 285 bp shorter than and 74% homologous with the regulatory gene psr of E. hirae ATCC 9790. Different clinical isolates of E. faecium, for which a wide range of benzylpenicillin MICs were observed, showed that the increases in MICs were related to two mechanisms. For some strains of intermediate resistance (MICs of 16 to 64 micrograms/ml), the increased level of resistance could be explained by the presence of larger quantities of PBP5fm which had an affinity for benzylpenicillin (second-order rate constant of protein acylation [k+2/K] values of 17 to 25 M(-1) s(-1)) that remained unchanged. For the two most highly resistant strains, EFM-1 (MIC, 90 micrograms/ml) and H80721 (MIC, 512 micrograms/ml), the resistance was related to different amino acid substitutions yielding very-low-affinity PBP5fm variants (k+2/K < or = 1.5 M(-1) s(-1)) which were synthesized in small quantities. More specifically, it appeared, with a three-dimensional model of the C-terminal domain of PBP5fm, that the substitutions of Met-485, located in the third position after the conserved SDN triad, by Thr in EFM-1 and by Ala in H80721 were the most likely cause of the decreasing affinity of PBP5fm observed in these strains.	0
Title: Thermoset Shape-Memory Polyurethane with Intrinsic Plasticity Enabled by Transcarbamoylation Abstract: Thermoset polymers are known for their superior thermomechanical properties, but the chemical crosslinking typically leads to intractability. This is reflected in the great differences between thermoset and thermoplastic shape-memory polymers; the former exhibit a robust shape memory but are not capable of redefining the permanent shape. Contrary to current knowledge, we reveal here that a classical thermoset shape-memory polyurethane is readily capable of permanent reshaping (plasticity) after a topological network rearrangement that is induced by transcarbamoylation. By employing the Jianzhi technique (also known as kirigami), unexpected shape-shifting versatility was observed for this otherwise classical material. As the essential carbamate moiety in polyurethanes is one of the most common polymer building units, we anticipate that our finding will have significant benefits beyond shape shifting.	0
Title: Discovery of a Mosaic-Like Biosynthetic Assembly Line with a Decarboxylative Off-Loading Mechanism through a Combination of Genome Mining and Imaging Abstract: The biosynthetic gene cluster for the antiplasmodial natural product siphonazole was identified by using a combination of genome mining, imaging, and expression studies in the natural producer Herpetosiphon sp. B060. The siphonazole backbone is assembled from an unusual starter unit from the shikimate pathway that is extended by the action of polyketide synthases and non-ribosomal peptide synthetases with unusual domain structures, including several split modules and a large number of duplicated domains and domains predicted to be inactive. Product release proceeds through decarboxylation and dehydration independent of the thioesterase SphJ and yields the diene terminus of siphonazole. High variation in terms of codon-usage within the gene cluster, together with the dislocated domain organization, suggest a recent emergence in evolutionary terms.	1
Title: A Novel Type Pathway-Specific Regulator and Dynamic Genome Environments of a Solanapyrone Biosynthesis Gene Cluster in the Fungus Ascochyta rabiei Abstract: Secondary metabolite genes are often clustered together and situated in particular genomic regions, like the subtelomere, that can facilitate niche adaptation in fungi. Solanapyrones are toxic secondary metabolites produced by fungi occupying different ecological niches. Full-genome sequencing of the ascomycete Ascochyta rabiei revealed a solanapyrone biosynthesis gene cluster embedded in an AT-rich region proximal to a telomere end and surrounded by Tc1/Mariner-type transposable elements. The highly AT-rich environment of the solanapyrone cluster is likely the product of repeat-induced point mutations. Several secondary metabolism-related genes were found in the flanking regions of the solanapyrone cluster. Although the solanapyrone cluster appears to be resistant to repeat-induced point mutations, a P450 monooxygenase gene adjacent to the cluster has been degraded by such mutations. Among the six solanapyrone cluster genes (sol1 to sol6), sol4 encodes a novel type of Zn(II)2Cys6 zinc cluster transcription factor. Deletion of sol4 resulted in the complete loss of solanapyrone production but did not compromise growth, sporulation, or virulence. Gene expression studies with the sol4 deletion and sol4-overexpressing mutants delimited the boundaries of the solanapyrone gene cluster and revealed that sol4 is likely a specific regulator of solanapyrone biosynthesis and appears to be necessary and sufficient for induction of the solanapyrone cluster genes. Despite the dynamic surrounding genomic regions, the solanapyrone gene cluster has maintained its integrity, suggesting important roles of solanapyrones in fungal biology.	1
Title: Identification of a gene cluster for telomestatin biosynthesis and heterologous expression using a specific promoter in a clean host Abstract: Telomestatin, a strong telomerase inhibitor with G-quadruplex stabilizing activity, is a potential therapeutic agent for treating cancers. Difficulties in isolating telomestatin from microbial cultures and in chemical synthesis are bottlenecks impeding the wider use. Therefore, improvement in telomestatin production and structural diversification are required for further utilization and application. Here, we discovered the gene cluster responsible for telomestatin biosynthesis, and achieved production of telomestatin by heterologous expression of this cluster in the engineered Streptomyces avermitilis SUKA strain. Utilization of an optimal promoter was essential for successful production. Gene disruption studies revealed that the tlsB, tlsC, and tlsO-T genes play key roles in telomestatin biosynthesis. Moreover, exchanging TlsC core peptide sequences resulted in the production of novel telomestatin derivatives. This study sheds light on the expansion of chemical diversity of natural peptide products for drug development.	1
Title: Dual phenazine gene clusters enable diversification during biosynthesis Abstract: Biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) bridging genotype and phenotype continuously evolve through gene mutations and recombinations to generate chemical diversity. Phenazine BGCs are widespread in bacteria, and the biosynthetic mechanisms of the formation of the phenazine structural core have been illuminated in the last decade. However, little is known about the complex phenazine core-modification machinery. Here, we report the diversity-oriented modifications of the phenazine core through two distinct BGCs in the entomopathogenic bacterium Xenorhabdus szentirmaii, which lives in symbiosis with nematodes. A previously unidentified aldehyde intermediate, which can be modified by multiple enzymatic and non-enzymatic reactions, is a common intermediate bridging the pathways encoded by these BGCs. Evaluation of the antibiotic activity of the resulting phenazine derivatives suggests a highly effective strategy to convert Gram-positive specific phenazines into broad-spectrum antibiotics, which might help the bacteria-nematode complex to maintain its special environmental niche.	1
Title: Divergent behavior of glycosylated threonine and serine derivatives in solid phase peptide synthesis Abstract: Solid phase peptide coupling of glycosylated threonine derivatives was systematically evaluated. In contrast to glycosylated serine derivatives which are highly prone to epimerization, glycosylated threonine derivatives produce only negligible amounts of epimerization. Under forcing conditions, glycosylated threonine analogs undergo β-elimination, rather than epimerization. Mechanistic studies and molecular modeling were used to understand the origin of the differences in reactivity.	0
Title: Reduction of O2 by iron-adriamycin Abstract: Electron paramagnetic resonance studies of the Fe2+- and Fe3+-adriamycin complexes are reported which demonstrate iron-mediated reduction of O2 by adriamycin. Under anaerobic conditions, Fe2+ binds to adriamycin, giving rise to an EPR-silent Fe2+-adriamycin complex. On addition of O2, the Fe2+ is oxidized to Fe3+ and a spectrum of Fe3+-adriamycin is seen. Under anaerobic conditions, the signal of Fe3+-adriamycin decreases as a function of time as the Fe3+ bound to adriamycin is reduced to Fe2+, and a transient spectrum of iron bound to oxidized adriamycin is observed. On addition of O2, the EPR signal of Fe3+-adriamycin returns as Fe2+ is oxidized back to Fe3+ with electron transfer to O2. This cycle of iron-catalyzed O2 reduction may be the mechanism of adriamycin's antitumor potency and some of its toxic side effects.	0
Title: Genome mining of novel rubiginones from Streptomyces sp. CB02414 and characterization of the post-PKS modification steps in rubiginone biosynthesis Abstract: Background:                       Rubiginones belong to the angucycline family of aromatic polyketides, and they have been shown to potentiate the vincristine (VCR)-induced cytotoxicity against VCR-resistant cancer cell lines. However, the biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) and biosynthetic pathways for rubiginones have not been reported yet.                  Results:                       In this study, based on bioinformatics analysis of the genome of Streptomyces sp. CB02414, we predicted the functions of the two type II polyketide synthases (PKSs) BGCs. The rub gene cluster was predicted to encode metabolites of the angucycline family. Scale-up fermentation of the CB02414 wild-type strain led to the discovery of eight rubiginones, including five new ones (rubiginones J, K, L, M, and N). Rubiginone J was proposed to be the final product of the rub gene cluster, which features extensive oxidation on the A-ring of the angucycline skeleton. Based on the production profiles of the CB02414 wild-type and the mutant strains, we proposed a biosynthetic pathway for the rubiginones in CB02414.                  Conclusions:                       A genome mining strategy enabled the efficient discovery of new rubiginones from Streptomyces sp. CB02414. Based on the isolated biosynthetic intermediates, a plausible biosynthetic pathway for the rubiginones was proposed. Our research lays the foundation for further studies on the mechanism of the cytochrome P450-catalyzed oxidation of angucyclines and for the generation of novel angucyclines using combinatorial biosynthesis strategies.	1
Title: Genes for production of the enediyne antitumor antibiotic C-1027 in Streptomyces globisporus are clustered with the cagA gene that encodes the C-1027 apoprotein Abstract: C-1027, the most potent member of the enediyne antitumor antibiotic family, is produced by Streptomyces globisporus C-1027 and consists of an apoprotein (encoded by the cagA gene) and a nonpeptidic chromophore. The C-1027 chromophore could be viewed as being derived biosynthetically from a benzoxazolinate, a deoxyamino hexose, a beta-amino acid, and an enediyne core. By adopting a strategy for cloning of the C-1027 biosynthesis gene cluster by mapping a putative dNDP-glucose 4,6-dehydratase (NGDH) gene to cagA, we have localized 75 kb of contiguous DNA from S. globisporus. DNA sequence analysis of two regions of the cloned gene cluster revealed two genes, sgcA and sgcB, that encode an NGDH enzyme and a transmembrane efflux protein, respectively, and confirmed that the cagA gene resides approximately 14 kb upstream of the sgcAB locus. The involvement of the cloned gene cluster in C-1027 biosynthesis was demonstrated by disrupting the sgcA gene to generate C-1027-nonproducing mutants and by complementing the sgcA mutants in vivo to restore C-1027 production. These results represent the first cloning of a gene cluster for enediyne antitumor antibiotic biosynthesis and provide a starting point for future genetic and biochemical investigations of C-1027 biosynthesis.	1
Title: Enantioselective functionalization of radical intermediates in redox catalysis: copper-catalyzed asymmetric oxytrifluoromethylation of alkenes Abstract: A method for the efficient enantioselective oxytrifluoromethylation of alkenes has been developed using a copper catalyst system. Mechanistic studies are consistent with a metal-catalyzed redox radical addition mechanism, in which a C–O bond is formed via the copper-mediated enantioselective trapping of a prochiral alkyl radical intermediate derived from the initial trifluoromethyl radical addition.	0
Title: Bacilysin from Bacillus amyloliquefaciens FZB42 has specific bactericidal activity against harmful algal bloom species Abstract: Harmful algal blooms, caused by massive and exceptional overgrowth of microalgae and cyanobacteria, are a serious environmental problem worldwide : In the present study, we looked for Bacillus strains with sufficiently strong anticyanobacterial activity to be used as biocontrol agents. Among 24 strains, Bacillus amyloliquefaciens FZB42 showed the strongest bactericidal activity against Microcystis aeruginosa, with a kill rate of 98.78%. The synthesis of the anticyanobacterial substance did not depend on Sfp, an enzyme that catalyzes a necessary processing step in the nonribosomal synthesis of lipopeptides and polyketides, but was associated with the aro gene cluster that is involved in the synthesis of the sfp-independent antibiotic bacilysin. Disruption of bacB, the gene in the cluster responsible for synthesizing bacilysin, or supplementation with the antagonist N-acetylglucosamine abolished the inhibitory effect, but this was restored when bacilysin synthesis was complemented. Bacilysin caused apparent changes in the algal cell wall and cell organelle membranes, and this resulted in cell lysis. Meanwhile, there was downregulated expression of glmS, psbA1, mcyB, and ftsZ-genes involved in peptidoglycan synthesis, photosynthesis, microcystin synthesis, and cell division, respectively. In addition, bacilysin suppressed the growth of other harmful algal species. In summary, bacilysin produced by B. amyloliquefaciens FZB42 has anticyanobacterial activity and thus could be developed as a biocontrol agent to mitigate the effects of harmful algal blooms.	1
Title: A cluster of genes involved in polysaccharide biosynthesis from Enterococcus faecalis OG1RF Abstract: Our previous work identified a cosmid clone containing a 43-kb insert from Enterococcus faecalis OG1RF that produced a nonprotein antigen in Escherichia coli. In the present work, we studied this clone in detail. Periodate treatment of lysates of the clone confirmed that the antigen was carbohydrate in nature. Analysis of DNA sequences and transposon insertion mutants suggested that the insert contained a multicistronic gene cluster. Database comparison showed that the cluster contained genes similar to genes involved in the biosynthesis of dTDP-rhamnose, glycosyltransferases, and ABC transporters involved in the export of sugar polymers from both gram-positive and gram-negative organisms. Insertions in several genes within the cluster abolished the immunoreactivity of the clone. This is the first report on a gene cluster of E. faecalis involved in the biosynthesis of an antigenic polysaccharide.	1
Title: Gain-of-function mutational activation of human tRNA synthetase procytokine Abstract: Disease-causing mutations occur in genes for aminoacyl tRNA synthetases. That some mutations are dominant suggests a gain of function. Native tRNA synthetases, such as tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase (TyrRS) and tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase, catalyze aminoacylation and are also procytokines that are activated by natural fragmentation. In principle, however, gain-of-function phenotypes could arise from mutational activation of synthetase procytokines. From crystal structure analysis, we hypothesized that a steric block of a critical Glu-Leu-Arg (ELR) motif in full-length TyrRS suppresses the cytokine activity of a natural fragment. To test this hypothesis, we attempted to uncover ELR in the procytokine by mutating a conserved tyrosine (Y341) that tethers ELR. Site-specific proteolytic cleavage and small-angle X-ray scattering established subtle opening of the structure by the mutation. Strikingly, four different assays demonstrated mutational activation of cytokine functions. The results prove the possibilities for constitutive gain-of-function mutations in tRNA synthetases.	0
Title: An excited state underlies gene regulation of a transcriptional riboswitch Abstract: Riboswitches control gene expression through ligand-dependent structural rearrangements of the sensing aptamer domain. However, we found that the Bacillus cereus fluoride riboswitch aptamer adopts identical tertiary structures in solution with and without ligand. Using chemical-exchange saturation transfer (CEST) NMR spectroscopy, we revealed that the structured ligand-free aptamer transiently accesses a low-populated (∼1%) and short-lived (∼3 ms) excited conformational state that unravels a conserved 'linchpin' base pair to signal transcription termination. Upon fluoride binding, this highly localized, fleeting process is allosterically suppressed, which activates transcription. We demonstrated that this mechanism confers effective fluoride-dependent gene activation over a wide range of transcription rates, which is essential for robust toxicity responses across diverse cellular conditions. These results unveil a novel switching mechanism that employs ligand-dependent suppression of an aptamer excited state to coordinate regulatory conformational transitions rather than adopting distinct aptamer ground-state tertiary architectures, exemplifying a new mode of ligand-dependent RNA regulation.	0
Title: Gene integration and expression and extracellular secretion of Erwinia chrysanthemi endoglucanase CelY (celY) and CelZ (celZ) in ethanologenic Klebsiella oxytoca P2 Abstract: The development of methods to reduce costs associated with the solubilization of cellulose is essential for the utilization of lignocellulose as a renewable feedstock for fuels and chemicals. One promising approach is the genetic engineering of ethanol-producing microorganisms that also produce cellulase enzymes during fermentation. By starting with an ethanologenic derivative (strain P2) of Klebsiella oxytoca M5A1 with the native ability to metabolize cellobiose, the need for supplemental beta-glucosidase was previously eliminated. In the current study, this approach has been extended by adding genes encoding endoglucanase activities. Genes celY and celZ from Erwinia chrysanthemi have been functionally integrated into the chromosome of P2 using surrogate promoters from Zymomonas mobilis for expression. Both were secreted into the extracellular milieu, producing more than 20,000 endoglucanase units (carboxymethyl cellulase activity) per liter of fermentation broth. During the fermentation of crystalline cellulose with low levels of commercial cellulases of fungal origin, these new strains produced up to 22% more ethanol than unmodified P2. Most of the beneficial contribution was attributed to CelY rather than to CelZ. These results suggest that fungal enzymes with substrate profiles resembling CelY (preference for long-chain polymers and lack of activity on soluble cello-oligosaccharides of two to five glucosyl residues) may be limiting in commercial cellulase preparations.	0
Title: Identification of a gene from Streptomyces rimosus M527 negatively affecting rimocidin biosynthesis and morphological differentiation Abstract: The polyene macrolide rimocidin, produced by Streptomyces rimosus M527, was found to be highly effective against a broad range of fungal plant pathogens. Current understanding of the regulatory mechanism of rimocidin biosynthesis and morphological differentiation in S. rimosus M527 is limited. NsdA is considered a negative regulator involved in morphological differentiation and biosynthesis of secondary metabolites in some Streptomyces species. In this study, nsdAsr was cloned from S. rimosus M527. The role of nsdAsr in rimocidin biosynthesis and morphological differentiation was investigated by gene deletion, complementation, and over-expression. A ΔnsdAsr mutant was obtained using CRISPR/Cas9. The mutant produced more rimocidin (46%) and accelerated morphological differentiation than the wild-type strain. Over-expression of nsdAsr led to a decrease in rimocidin production and impairment of morphological differentiation. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis revealed that transcription of rim genes responsible for rimocidin biosynthesis was upregulated in the ΔnsdAsr mutant but downregulated in the nsdAsr over-expression strain. Similar effects have been described for Streptomyces coelicolor M145 and the industrial toyocamycin-producing strain Streptomyces diastatochromogenes 1628. KEY POINTS: • A negative regulator for sporulation and rimocidin production was identified. • The CRISPR/Cas9 system was used for gene deletion in S. rimosus M527.	1
Title: Molecular cloning and heterologous expression of a biosynthetic gene cluster for the antitubercular agent D-cycloserine produced by Streptomyces lavendulae Abstract: In the present study, we successfully cloned a 21-kb DNA fragment containing a d-cycloserine (DCS) biosynthetic gene cluster from a DCS-producing Streptomyces lavendulae strain, ATCC 11924. The putative gene cluster consists of 10 open reading frames (ORFs), designated dcsA to dcsJ. This cluster includes two ORFs encoding D-alanyl-D-alanine ligase (dcsI) and a putative membrane protein (dcsJ) as the self-resistance determinants of the producer organism, indicated by our previous work. When the 10 ORFs were introduced into DCS-nonproducing Streptomyces lividans 66 as a heterologous host cell, the transformant acquired DCS productivity. This reveals that the introduced genes are responsible for the biosynthesis of DCS. As anticipated, the disruption of dcsG, seen in the DCS biosynthetic gene cluster, made it possible for the strain ATCC 11924 to lose its DCS production. We here propose the DCS biosynthetic pathway. First, L-serine is O acetylated by a dcsE-encoded enzyme homologous to homoserine O-acetyltransferase. Second, O-acetyl-L-serine accepts hydroxyurea via an O-acetylserine sulfhydrylase homolog (dcsD product) and forms O-ureido-L-serine. The hydroxyurea must be supplied by the catalysis of a dcsB-encoded arginase homolog using the L-arginine derivative, N(G)-hydroxy-L-arginine. The resulting O-ureido-L-serine is then racemized to O-ureido-D-serine by a homolog of diaminopimelate epimerase. Finally, O-ureido-D-serine is cyclized to form DCS with the release of ammonia and carbon dioxide. The cyclization must be done by the dcsG or dcsH product, which belongs to the ATP-grasp fold family of protein.	1
Title: Identification of the main promoter directing cereulide biosynthesis in emetic Bacillus cereus and its application for real-time monitoring of ces gene expression in foods Abstract: Cereulide, the emetic Bacillus cereus toxin, is synthesized by cereulide synthetase via a nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) mechanism. Previous studies focused on the identification, structural organization, and biochemical characterization of the ces gene locus encoding cereulide synthetase; however, detailed information about the transcriptional organization of the ces genes was lacking. The present study shows that the cesPTABCD genes are transcribed as a 23-kb polycistronic transcript, while cesH, encoding a putative hydrolase, is transcribed from its own promoter. Transcription initiation was mapped by primer extension and rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE). Deletion analysis of promoter elements revealed a main promoter located upstream of the cesP coding sequence, encoding a 4'-phosphopantetheinyl transferase. This promoter drives transcription of cesPTABCD. In addition, intracistronic promoter regions in proximity to the translational start sites of cesB and cesT were identified but were only weakly active under the chosen assay conditions. The identified main promoter was amplified from the emetic reference strain B. cereus F4810/72 and fused to luciferase genes in order to study promoter activity in complex environments and to establish a biomonitoring system to assess cereulide production in different types of foods. ces promoter activity was strongly influenced by the food matrix and varied by 5 orders of magnitude. The amount of cereulide toxin extracted from spiked foods correlated well with the bioluminescence data, thus illustrating the potential of the established reporter system for monitoring of ces gene expression in complex matrices.	1
Title: Myxochelin biosynthesis: direct evidence for two- and four-electron reduction of a carrier protein-bound thioester Abstract: Microorganisms produce small molecules known as siderophores to scavenge iron from the environment. Insight into iron acquisition in myxobacteria has been provided recently by the sequencing of the gene cluster for the catecholate myxochelins A and B, from the myxobacterium Stigmatella aurantiaca Sg a15. The gene cluster contains enzymes (MxcCDEF) for assembly of 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid (DHBA), an amino transferase, MxcL, and a nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) subunit, MxcG. In the proposed pathway to the myxochelins, two molecules of DHBA are condensed with the two amino groups of lysine, which is itself tethered to the peptidyl carrier protein domain (PCP) of MxcG. The resulting thioester is then reduced by the NADPH-dependent reductase (Red) domain of MxcG to generate an aldehyde intermediate; subsequent Red-catalyzed reduction yields myxochelin A, while transamination by MxcL produces myxochelin B. Although myxochelin A has been obtained successfully in vitro, it has not been possible to date to reconstitute the transamination reaction to give myxochelin B nor to unequivocally establish the intermediacy of the aldehyde. We report here the successful biosynthesis of myxochelin B in vitro. Furthermore, we demonstrate for the first time the existence of an aldehyde intermediate in the four-electron reduction of a PCP-bound thioester. Finally, we show that the relative levels of myxochelin A and B are likely to be controlled by the direct competition of MxcL and the MxcG Red domain for a free aldehyde intermediate.	1
Title: REVERSAL OF d-CYCLOSERINE INHIBITION OF BACTERIAL GROWTH BY ALANINE Abstract: Zygmunt, Walter A. (Mead Johnson & Co., Evansville, Ind.). Reversal of d-cycloserine inhibition of bacterial growth by alanine. J. Bacteriol. 84:154-156. 1962.-Reversal of the antibacterial activity of d-4-amino-3-isoxazolidone by alanine in bacterial cultures actively growing on chemically defined media was compared in cultures requiring exogenous alanine and those capable of its synthesis. dl-Alanine was the most effective reversal agent in Pediococcus cerevisiae, an alanine-requiring organism, and d-alanine was effective in Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus, organisms synthesizing alanine. With all three cultures, l-alanine was the least effective reversal agent.	0
Title: A Maldiisotopic Approach to Discover Natural Products: Cryptomaldamide, a Hybrid Tripeptide from the Marine Cyanobacterium Moorea producens Abstract: Genome sequencing of microorganisms has revealed a greatly increased capacity for natural products biosynthesis than was previously recognized from compound isolation efforts alone. Hence, new methods are needed for the discovery and description of this hidden secondary metabolite potential. Here we show that provision of heavy nitrogen 15N-nitrate to marine cyanobacterial cultures followed by single-filament MALDI analysis over a period of days was highly effective in identifying a new natural product with an exceptionally high nitrogen content. The compound, named cryptomaldamide, was subsequently isolated using MS to guide the purification process, and its structure determined by 2D NMR and other spectroscopic and chromatographic methods. Bioinformatic analysis of the draft genome sequence identified a 28.7 kB gene cluster that putatively encodes for cryptomaldamide biosynthesis. Notably, an amidinotransferase is proposed to initiate the biosynthetic process by transferring an amidino group from arginine to serine to produce the first residue to be incorporated by the hybrid NRPS-PKS pathway. The maldiisotopic approach presented here is thus demonstrated to provide an orthogonal method by which to discover novel chemical diversity from Nature.	1
Title: Genomics of pyoverdine-mediated iron uptake in pseudomonads Abstract: Pyoverdines (PVDs) are complex siderophores produced by members of the fluorescent Pseudomonas. They comprise a dihydroxyquinoline fluorescent chromophore joined to a peptide of remarkably variable length and composition. In Pseudomonas aeruginosa, PVDs also function as signal molecules for the production of virulence factors. Genes responsible for the biosynthesis, excretion, uptake and regulation of these high-affinity siderophores are located either at a single locus or at up to three different loci in the genomes of the four pseudomonads analyzed. The peptide backbone of PVD is assembled by non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) and modified by accessory enzymes in the cytoplasm, and probably the periplasm. Regulation of PVD production and uptake depends on two extracytoplasmic sigma factors (ECF-sigmas), PvdS and FpvI, together with one anti-sigma, FpvR.	1
Title: To settle or to move? The interplay between two classes of cyclic lipopeptides in the biocontrol strain Pseudomonas CMR12a Abstract: Pseudomonas CMR12a is a biocontrol strain that produces phenazine antibiotics and as yet uncharacterized cyclic lipopeptides (CLPs). The CLPs of CMR12a were studied by chemical structure analysis and in silico analysis of the gene clusters encoding the non-ribosomal peptide synthetases responsible for CLP biosynthesis. CMR12a produces two different classes of CLPs: orfamides B, D and E, whereby the latter two represent new derivatives of the orfamide family, and sessilins A-C. The orfamides are made up of a 10 amino acid peptide coupled to a β-hydroxydodecanoyl or β-hydroxytetradecanoyl fatty acid moiety, and are related to orfamides produced by biocontrol strain Pseudomonas protegens Pf-5. The sessilins consist of an 18-amino acid peptide linked to a β-hydroxyoctanoyl fatty acid and differ in one amino acid from tolaasins, toxins produced by the mushroom pathogen Pseudomonas tolaasii. CLP biosynthesis mutants were constructed and tested for biofilm formation and swarming motility. Orfamides appeared indispensable for swarming while sessilin mutants showed reduced biofilm formation, but enhanced swarming motility. The interplay between the two classes of CLPs fine tunes these processes. The presence of sessilins in wild type CMR12a interferes with swarming by hampering the release of orfamides and by co-precipitating orfamides to form a white line in agar.	1
Title: Bioactivity-guided genome mining reveals the lomaiviticin biosynthetic gene cluster in Salinispora tropica Abstract: The use of genome sequences has become routine in guiding the discovery and identification of microbial natural products and their biosynthetic pathways. In silico prediction of molecular features, such as metabolic building blocks, physico-chemical properties or biological functions, from orphan gene clusters has opened up the characterization of many new chemo- and genotypes in genome mining approaches. Here, we guided our genome mining of two predicted enediyne pathways in Salinispora tropica CNB-440 by a DNA interference bioassay to isolate DNA-targeting enediyne polyketides. An organic extract of S. tropica showed DNA-interference activity that surprisingly was not abolished in genetic mutants of the targeted enediyne pathways, ST_pks1 and spo. Instead we showed that the product of the orphan type II polyketide synthase pathway, ST_pks2, is solely responsible for the DNA-interfering activity of the parent strain. Subsequent comparative metabolic profiling revealed the lomaiviticins, glycosylated diazofluorene polyketides, as the ST_pks2 products. This study marks the first report of the 59 open reading frame lomaiviticin gene cluster (lom) and supports the biochemical logic of their dimeric construction through a pathway related to the kinamycin monomer.	1
Title: Reduction of human defensin 5 affords a high-affinity zinc-chelating peptide Abstract: Human defensin 5 (HD5) is a 32-residue cysteine-rich host-defense peptide that exhibits three disulfide bonds in the oxidized form (HD5ox). It is abundant in small intestinal Paneth cells, which release HD5 into the intestinal lumen and house a labile Zn(II) store of unknown function. Here, we consider the redox properties of HD5 and report that the reduced form, HD5red, is a metal-ion chelator. HD5 has a midpoint potential of -257 mV at pH 7.0. HD5red utilizes its cysteine residues to coordinate one equivalent of Zn(II) with an apparent Kd1 value in the midpicomolar range. Zn(II) or Cd(II) binding perturbs the oxidative folding pathway of HD5red to HD5ox. Whereas HD5red is highly susceptible to proteolytic degradation, the Zn(II)-bound form displays resistance to hydrolytic breakdown by trypsin and other proteases. The ability of a reduced defensin peptide to coordinate Zn(II) provides a putative mechanism for how these peptides persist in vivo.	0
Title: Heterologous Expression of a Cryptic Gene Cluster from Streptomyces leeuwenhoekii C34T Yields a Novel Lasso Peptide, Leepeptin Abstract: Analysis of the genome sequence of Streptomyces leeuwenhoekii C34T identified biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) for three different lasso peptides (Lp1, Lp2, and Lp3) which were not known to be made by the strain. Lasso peptides represent relatively new members of the RiPP (ribosomally synthesized and posttranslationally modified peptides) family of natural products and have not been extensively studied. Lp3, whose production could be detected in culture supernatants from S. leeuwenhoekii C34T and after heterologous expression of its BGC in Streptomyces coelicolor, is identical to the previously characterized chaxapeptin. Lp1, whose production could not be detected or achieved heterologously, appears to be identical to a recently identified member of the citrulassin family of lasso peptides. Since production of Lp2 by S. leeuwenhoekii C34T was not observed, its BGC was also expressed in S. coelicolor The lasso peptide was isolated and its structure confirmed by mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance analyses, revealing a novel structure that appears to represent a new family of lasso peptides.IMPORTANCE Recent developments in genome sequencing combined with bioinformatic analysis have revealed that actinomycetes contain a plethora of unexpected BGCs and thus have the potential to produce many more natural products than previously thought. This reflects the inability to detect the production of these compounds under laboratory conditions, perhaps through the use of inappropriate growth media or the absence of the environmental cues required to elicit expression of the corresponding BGCs. One approach to overcoming this problem is to circumvent the regulatory mechanisms that control expression of the BGC in its natural host by deploying heterologous expression. The generally compact nature of lasso peptide BGCs makes them particularly amenable to this approach, and, in the example given here, analysis revealed a new member of the lasso peptide family of RiPPs. This approach should be readily applicable to other cryptic lasso peptide gene clusters and would also facilitate the design and production of nonnatural variants by changing the sequence encoding the core peptide, as has been achieved with other classes of RiPPs.	1
Title: Molecular basis of substrate promiscuity for the SAM-dependent O-methyltransferase NcsB1, involved in the biosynthesis of the enediyne antitumor antibiotic neocarzinostatin Abstract: The small molecule component of chromoprotein enediyne antitumor antibiotics is biosynthesized through a convergent route, incorporating amino acid, polyketide, and carbohydrate building blocks around a central enediyne hydrocarbon core. The naphthoic acid moiety of the enediyne neocarzinostatin plays key roles in the biological activity of the natural product by interacting with both the carrier protein and duplex DNA at the site of action. We have previously described the in vitro characterization of an S-adenosylmethionine-dependent O-methyltransferase (NcsB1) in the neocarzinostatin biosynthetic pathway [Luo, Y., Lin, S., Zhang, J., Cooke, H. A., Bruner, S. D., and Shen, B. (2008) J. Biol. Chem. 283, 14694-14702]. Here we provide a structural basis for NcsB1 activity, illustrating that the enzyme shares an overall architecture with a large family of S-adenosylmethionine-dependent proteins. In addition, NcsB1 represents the first enzyme to be structurally characterized in the biosynthetic pathway of neocarzinostatin. By cocrystallizing the enzyme with various combinations of the cofactor and substrate analogues, details of the active site structure have been established. Changes in subdomain orientation were observed via comparison of structures in the presence and absence of substrate, suggesting that reorientation of the enzyme is involved in binding of the substrate. In addition, residues important for substrate discrimination were predicted and probed through site-directed mutagenesis and in vitro biochemical characterization.	1
Title: Insights into Clostridium phytofermentans biofilm formation: aggregation, microcolony development and the role of extracellular DNA Abstract: Biofilm formation is a critical component to the lifestyle of many naturally occurring cellulose-degrading microbes. In this work, cellular aggregation and biofilm formation of Clostridium phytofermentans, a cellulolytic anaerobic bacterium, was investigated using a combination of microscopy and analytical techniques. Aggregates included thread-like linkages and a DNA/protein-rich extracellular matrix when grown on soluble cellobiose. Similar dense biofilms formed on the surface of the model cellulosic substrate Whatman no. 1 filter paper. Following initially dispersed attachment, microcolonies of ~500 µm diameter formed on the filter paper after 6 days. Enzymic treatment of both the biofilm and cellular aggregates with DNase and proteinase resulted in significant loss of rigidity, pointing to the key role of extracellular DNA and proteins in the biofilm structure. A high-throughput biofilm assay was adapted for studying potential regulators of biofilm formation. Various media manipulations were shown to greatly impact biofilm formation, including repression in the presence of glucose but not the β(1→4)-linked disaccharide cellobiose, implicating a balance of hydrolytic activity and assimilation to maintain biofilm integrity. Using the microtitre plate biofilm assay, DNase and proteinase dispersed ~60 and 30 % of mature biofilms, respectively, whilst RNase had no impact. This work suggests that Clostridium phytofermentans has evolved a DNA/protein-rich biofilm matrix complementing its cellulolytic nature. These insights add to our current understanding of natural ecosystems as well as strategies for efficient bioprocess design.	0
Title: Promoter region of the Escherichia coli O7-specific lipopolysaccharide gene cluster: structural and functional characterization of an upstream untranslated mRNA sequence Abstract: We report the identification of the promoter region of the Escherichia coli O7-specific lipopolysaccharide (LPS) gene cluster (wbEcO7). Typical -10 and -35 sequences were found to be located in the intervening region between galF and rlmB, the first gene of the wbEcO7 cluster. Data from RNase protection experiments revealed the existence of an untranslated leader mRNA segment of 173 bp, including the JUMPStart and two ops sequences. We characterized the structure of this leader mRNA by using the program Mfold and a combination of nested and internal deletions transcriptionally fused to a promoterless lac operon. Our results indicated that the leader mRNA may fold into a series of complex stem-loop structures, one of which includes the JUMPStart element. We have also found that one of the ops sequences resides on the predicted stem and the other resides on the loop region, and we confirmed that these sequences are essential for the RfaH-mediated regulation of the O polysaccharide cluster. A very similar stem-loop structure could be predicted in the promoter region of the LPS core operon encoding the waaQGPSBIJYZK genes. We observed another predicted stem-loop, located immediately downstream from the wbEcO7 transcription initiation site, which appeared to be involved in premature termination of transcription. This putative stem-loop is common to many other O polysaccharide gene clusters but is not present in core oligosaccharide genes. wbEcO7-lac transcriptional fusions in single copy numbers were also used to determine the effects of various environmental cues in the transcriptional regulation of O polysaccharide synthesis. No effects were detected with temperature, osmolarity, Mg2+ concentration, and drugs inducing changes in DNA supercoiling. We therefore conclude that the wbEcO7 promoter activity may be constitutive and that regulation takes place at the level of elongation of the mRNA in a RfaH-mediated manner.	1
Title: Total synthesis of viridicatumtoxin B and analogues thereof: strategy evolution, structural revision, and biological evaluation Abstract: The details of the total synthesis of viridicatumtoxin B (1) are described. Initial synthetic strategies toward this intriguing tetracycline antibiotic resulted in the development of key alkylation and Lewis acid-mediated spirocyclization reactions to form the hindered EF spirojunction, as well as Michael-Dieckmann reactions to set the A and C rings. The use of an aromatic A-ring substrate, however, was found to be unsuitable for the introduction of the requisite hydroxyl groups at carbons 4a and 12a. Applying these previous tactics, we developed stepwise approaches to oxidize carbons 12a and 4a based on enol- and enolate-based oxidations, respectively, the latter of which was accomplished after systematic investigations that revealed critical reactivity patterns. The herein described synthetic strategy resulted in the total synthesis of viridicatumtoxin B (1), which, in turn, formed the basis for the revision of its originally assigned structure. The developed chemistry facilitated the synthesis of a series of viridicatumtoxin analogues, which were evaluated against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial strains, including drug-resistant pathogens, revealing the first structure-activity relationships within this structural type.	1
Title: Stable benzotriazole esters as mechanism-based inactivators of the severe acute respiratory syndrome 3CL protease Abstract: Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is caused by a newly emerged coronavirus that infected more than 8000 individuals and resulted in more than 800 fatalities in 2003. Currently, there is no effective treatment for this epidemic. SARS-3CL(pro) has been shown to be essential for replication and is thus a target for drug discovery. Here, a class of stable benzotriazole esters was reported as mechanism-based inactivators of 3CL(pro), and the most potent inactivator exhibited a k(inact) of 0.0011 s(-1) and a K(i) of 7.5 nM. Mechanistic investigation with kinetic and mass spectrometry analyses indicates that the active site Cys145 is acylated, and that no irreversible inactivation was observed with the use of the C145A mutant. In addition, a noncovalent, competitive inhibition became apparent by using benzotriazole ester surrogates in which the bridged ester-oxygen group is replaced with carbon.	0
Title: Structural basis for C-ribosylation in the alnumycin A biosynthetic pathway Abstract: Alnumycin A is an exceptional aromatic polyketide that contains a carbohydrate-like 4'-hydroxy-5'-hydroxymethyl-2',7'-dioxane moiety attached to the aglycone via a carbon-carbon bond. Recently, we have identified the D-ribose-5-phosphate origin of the dioxane unit and demonstrated that AlnA and AlnB are responsible for the overall C-ribosylation reaction. Here, we provide direct evidence that AlnA is a natural C-glycosynthase, which catalyzes the attachment of D-ribose-5-phosphate to prealnumycin by formation of the C(8)-C(1') bond as demonstrated by the structure of the intermediate alnumycin P. This compound is subsequently dephosphorylated by AlnB, an enzyme of the haloacid dehalogenase superfamily. Structure determination of the native trimeric AlnA to 2.1-Å resolution revealed a highly globular fold encompassing an α/β/α sandwich. The crystal structure of the complex with D-ribose-5-phosphate indicated that the phosphosugar is bound in the open-chain configuration. Identification of residues E29, K86, and K159 near the C-1 carbonyl of the ligand led us to propose that the carbon-carbon bond formation proceeds through a Michael-type addition. Determination of the crystal structure of the monomeric AlnB in the open conformation to 1.25-Å resolution showed that the protein consists of core and cap domains. Modeling of alnumycin P inside the cap domain positioned the phosphate group next to a Mg(2+) ion present at the junction of the domains. Mutagenesis data were consistent with the canonical reaction mechanism for this enzyme family revealing the importance of residues D15 and D17 for catalysis.

Title: Cloning of the polyketide synthase gene atX from Aspergillus terreus and its identification as the 6-methylsalicylic acid synthase gene by heterologous expression Abstract: Southern blot analysis of genomic DNAs of several fungi that produce polyketide compounds with the 6-methylsalicylic acid synthase (MSAS) gene of Penicillium patulum as a probe indicated the presence of an MSAS-homologous gene in the (+)-geodin-producing strain IMI 16,043 of Aspergillus terreus. The gene, designated atX was cloned from an A. terreus genomic DNA library and 7588 bp of the gene together with its flanking regions were sequenced to reveal the presence of a 5.5 kb open reading frame coding for a protein of 1800 amino acids with 190 kDa molecular mass. The presence of a short (70 bp) intron near the N-terminus of the atX gene was predicted that contains the canonical GT and AG dinucleotides at its 5'- and 3'-splicing junctions. The predicted ATX polypeptide showed high homology with P. patulum MSAS along the whole sequence. On the other hand, slight homology was detected only around the beta-ketoacyl synthase regions of Aspergillus nidulans wA, PKSST and Colletotrichum lagenarium PKS1. No transcription of atX was observed throughout the culture period by Northern blotting analysis. To identify the function of the polypeptide encoded by the atX gene, its coding region was introduced into the fungal expression vector pTAex3 under the control of the amyB promoter. The constructed expression plasmid was introduced into A. nidulans. The transformant produced significant amounts of 6-methylsalicylic acid, the structure of which was identified by physicochemical analysis. This result unambiguously demonstrated that the atX gene codes for MSAS of A. terreus.	1
Title: TrpE feedback mutants reveal roadblocks and conduits toward increasing secondary metabolism in Aspergillus fumigatus Abstract: Small peptides formed from non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPS) are bioactive molecules produced by many fungi including the genus Aspergillus. A subset of NRPS utilizes tryptophan and its precursor, the non-proteinogenic amino acid anthranilate, in synthesis of various metabolites such as Aspergillus fumigatus fumiquinazolines (Fqs) produced by the fmq gene cluster. The A. fumigatus genome contains two putative anthranilate synthases - a key enzyme in conversion of anthranilic acid to tryptophan - one beside the fmq cluster and one in a region of co-linearity with other Aspergillus spp. Only the gene found in the co-linear region, trpE, was involved in tryptophan biosynthesis. We found that site-specific mutations of the TrpE feedback domain resulted in significantly increased production of anthranilate, tryptophan, p-aminobenzoate and fumiquinazolines FqF and FqC. Supplementation with tryptophan restored metabolism to near wild type levels in the feedback mutants and suggested that synthesis of the tryptophan degradation product kynurenine could negatively impact Fq synthesis. The second putative anthranilate synthase gene next to the fmq cluster was termed icsA for its considerable identity to isochorismate synthases in bacteria. Although icsA had no impact on A. fumigatus Fq production, deletion and over-expression of icsA increased and decreased respectively aromatic amino acid levels suggesting that IcsA can draw from the cellular chorismate pool.	0
Title: Sex-specific gene expression during asexual development of Neurospora crassa Abstract: The impact of loci that determine sexual identity upon the asexual, dominant stage of fungal life history has been well studied. To investigate their impact, expression differences between strains of different mating type during asexual development were assayed, with RNA sampled from otherwise largely isogenic mat A and mat a strains of Neurospora crassa at early, middle, and late clonal stages of development. We observed significant differences in overall gene expression between mating types across clonal development, especially at late development stages. The expression levels of mating-type genes and pheromone genes were assayed by reverse transcription and quantitative PCR, revealing expression of pheromone and receptor genes in strains of both mating types in all development stages, and revealing that mating type (mat) genes were increasingly expressed over the course of asexual development. Interestingly, among differentially expressed genes, the mat A genotype more frequently exhibited a higher expression level than mat a, and demonstrated greater transcriptional regulatory dynamism. Significant up-regulation of expression was observed for many late light-responsive genes at late asexual development stages. Further investigation of the impact of light and the roles of light response genes in asexual development of both mating types are warranted.	0
Title: High cell density perfusion process for high yield of influenza A virus production using MDCK suspension cells Abstract: Similar to the recent COVID-19 pandemic, influenza A virus poses a constant threat to the global community. For the treatment of flu disease, both antivirals and vaccines are available with vaccines the most effective and safest approach. In order to overcome limitations in egg-based vaccine manufacturing, cell culture-based processes have been established. While this production method avoids egg-associated risks in face of pandemics, process intensification using animal suspension cells in high cell density perfusion cultures should allow to further increase manufacturing capacities worldwide. In this work, we demonstrate the development of a perfusion process using Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) suspension cells for influenza A (H1N1) virus production from scale-down shake flask cultivations to laboratory scale stirred tank bioreactors. Shake flask cultivations using semi-perfusion mode enabled high-yield virus harvests (4.25 log10(HAU/100 μL)) from MDCK cells grown up to 41 × 106 cells/mL. Scale-up to bioreactors with an alternating tangential flow (ATF) perfusion system required optimization of pH control and implementation of a temperature shift during the infection phase. Use of a capacitance probe for on-line perfusion control allowed to minimize medium consumption. This contributed to a better process control and a more economical performance while maintaining a maximum virus titer of 4.37 log10(HAU/100 μL) and an infectious virus titer of 1.83 × 1010 virions/mL. Overall, this study clearly demonstrates recent advances in cell culture-based perfusion processes for next-generation high-yield influenza vaccine manufacturing for pandemic preparedness. KEY POINTS: • First MDCK suspension cell-based perfusion process for IAV produciton was established. • "Cell density effect" was overcome and process was intensified by reduction of medium use and automated process control. • The process achieved cell density over 40 × 106 cells/mL and virus yield over 4.37 log10(HAU/100 μL).	0
Title: Escherichia coli induces DNA double-strand breaks in eukaryotic cells Abstract: Transient infection of eukaryotic cells with commensal and extraintestinal pathogenic Escherichia coli of phylogenetic group B2 blocks mitosis and induces megalocytosis. This trait is linked to a widely spread genomic island that encodes giant modular nonribosomal peptide and polyketide synthases. Contact with E. coli expressing this gene cluster causes DNA double-strand breaks and activation of the DNA damage checkpoint pathway, leading to cell cycle arrest and eventually to cell death. Discovery of hybrid peptide-polyketide genotoxins in E. coli will change our view on pathogenesis and commensalism and open new biotechnological applications.	1
Title: The biology of vision of Drosophila Abstract: Phototransduction systems in vertebrates and invertebrates share a great deal of similarity in overall strategy but differ significantly in the underlying molecular machinery. Both are rhodopsin-based G protein-coupled signaling cascades displaying exquisite sensitivity and broad dynamic range. However, light activation of vertebrate photoreceptors leads to activation of a cGMP-phosphodiesterase effector and the generation of a hyperpolarizing response. In contrast, activation of invertebrate photoreceptors, like Drosophila, leads to stimulation of phospholipase C and the generation of a depolarizing receptor potential. The comparative study of these two systems of phototransduction offers the opportunity to understand how similar biological problems may be solved by different molecular mechanisms of signal transduction. The study of this process in Drosophila, a system ideally suited to genetic and molecular manipulation, allows us to dissect the function and regulation of such a complex signaling cascade in its normal cellular environment. In this manuscript I review some of our recent findings and the strategies used to dissect this process.	0
Title: Taurine Boosts Cellular Uptake of Small D-Peptides for Enzyme-Instructed Intracellular Molecular Self-Assembly Abstract: Due to their biostability, D-peptides are emerging as an important molecular platform for biomedical applications. Being proteolytically resistant, D-peptides lack interactions with endogenous transporters and hardly enter cells. Here we show that taurine, a natural amino acid, drastically boosts the cellular uptake of small D-peptides in mammalian cells by >10-fold, from 118 μM (without conjugating taurine) to >1.6 mM (after conjugating taurine). The uptake of a large amount of the ester conjugate of taurine and D-peptide allows intracellular esterase to trigger intracellular self-assembly of the D-peptide derivative, further enhancing their cellular accumulation. The study on the mechanism of the uptake reveals that the conjugates enter cells via both dynamin-dependent endocytosis and macropinocytosis, but likely not relying on taurine transporters. Differing fundamentally from the positively charged cell-penetrating peptides, the biocompatibility, stability, and simplicity of the enzyme-cleavable taurine motif promise new ways to promote the uptake of bioactive molecules for countering the action of efflux pump and contributing to intracellular molecular self-assembly.	0
Title: Direct Enzymatic Synthesis of a Deep-Blue Fluorescent Noncanonical Amino Acid from Azulene and Serine Abstract: We report a simple, one-step enzymatic synthesis of the blue fluorescent noncanonical amino acid β-(1-azulenyl)-l-alanine (AzAla). By using an engineered tryptophan synthase β-subunit (TrpB), stereochemically pure AzAla can be synthesized at scale starting from commercially available azulene and l-serine. Mutation of a universally conserved catalytic glutamate in the active site to glycine has only a modest effect on native activity with indole but abolishes activity on azulene, suggesting that this glutamate activates azulene for nucleophilic attack by stabilization of the aromatic ion.	0
Title: Identification of caerulomycin A gene cluster implicates a tailoring amidohydrolase Abstract: The biosynthetic gene cluster for caerulomycin A (1) was cloned and characterized from the marine actinomycete Actinoalloteichus cyanogriseus WH1-2216-6, which revealed an unusual hybrid polyketide synthase (PKS)/nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) system. The crmL disruption mutant accumulated caerulomycin L (2) with an extended L-leucine at C-7, implicating an amidohydrolase activity for CrmL. The leucine-removing activity was confirmed for crude CrmL enzymes. Heterologous expression of the 1 gene cluster led to 1 production in Streptomyces coelicolor.	1
Title: Discovery of varlaxins, new aeruginosin-type inhibitors of human trypsins Abstract: Low-molecular weight natural products display vast structural diversity and have played a key role in the development of novel therapeutics. Here we report the discovery of novel members of the aeruginosin family of natural products, which we named varlaxins. The chemical structures of varlaxins 1046A and 1022A were determined using a combination of mass spectrometry, analysis of one- and two-dimensional NMR spectra, and HPLC analysis of Marfey's derivatives. These analyses revealed that varlaxins 1046A and 1022A are composed of the following moieties: 2-O-methylglyceric acid 3-O-sulfate, isoleucine, 2-carboxy-6-hydroxyoctahydroindole (Choi), and a terminal arginine derivative. Varlaxins 1046A and 1022A differ in the cyclization of this arginine moiety. Interestingly, an unusual α-D-glucopyranose moiety derivatized with two 4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid residues was bound to Choi, a structure not previously reported for other members of the aeruginosin family. We sequenced the complete genome of Nostoc sp. UHCC 0870 and identified the putative 36 kb varlaxin biosynthetic gene cluster. Bioinformatics analysis confirmed that varlaxins belong to the aeruginosin family of natural products. Varlaxins 1046A and 1022A strongly inhibited the three human trypsin isoenzymes with IC50 of 0.62-3.6 nM and 97-230 nM, respectively, including a prometastatic trypsin-3, which is a therapeutically relevant target in several types of cancer. These results substantially broaden the genetic and chemical diversity of the aeruginosin family and provide evidence that the aeruginosin family is a source of strong inhibitors of human serine proteases.	1
Title: Patellamide A and C biosynthesis by a microcin-like pathway in Prochloron didemni, the cyanobacterial symbiont of Lissoclinum patella Abstract: Prochloron spp. are obligate cyanobacterial symbionts of many didemnid family ascidians. It has been proposed that the cyclic peptides of the patellamide class found in didemnid extracts are synthesized by Prochloron spp., but studies in which host and symbiont cells are separated and chemically analyzed to identify the biosynthetic source have yielded inconclusive results. As part of the Prochloron didemni sequencing project, we identified patellamide biosynthetic genes and confirmed their function by heterologous expression of the whole pathway in Escherichia coli. The primary sequence of patellamides A and C is encoded on a single ORF that resembles a precursor peptide. We propose that this prepatellamide is heterocyclized to form thiazole and oxazoline rings, and the peptide is cleaved to yield the two cyclic patellamides, A and C. This work represents the full sequencing and functional expression of a marine natural-product pathway from an obligate symbiont. In addition, a related cluster was identified in Trichodesmium erythraeum IMS101, an important bloom-forming cyanobacterium.	1
Title: Development of a Transcription Factor-Based Lactam Biosensor Abstract: Lactams are an important class of commodity chemicals used in the manufacture of nylons, with millions of tons produced every year. Biological production of lactams could be greatly improved by high-throughput sensors for lactam biosynthesis. To identify biosensors of lactams, we applied a chemoinformatic approach inspired by small molecule drug discovery. We define this approach as analogue generation toward catabolizable chemicals or AGTC. We discovered a lactam biosensor based on the ChnR/Pb transcription factor-promoter pair. The microbial biosensor is capable of sensing ε-caprolactam, δ-valerolactam, and butyrolactam in a dose-dependent manner. The biosensor has sufficient specificity to discriminate against lactam biosynthetic intermediates and therefore could potentially be applied for high-throughput metabolic engineering for industrially important high titer lactam biosynthesis.	0
Title: Proton-detected solid-state NMR spectroscopy of natural-abundance peptide and protein pharmaceuticals Abstract: The natural way: A sensitive NMR spectroscopic method is developed to obtain well-resolved two-dimensional spectra ((15)N-(1)H and (13)C-(1)H) for natural-abundance (that is, without the need for isotopic enrichment) large-molecule samples, such as biopharmaceuticals. This method gives structural insights on two lyophilized aprotinin samples and three insulin samples in lyophilized, microcrystalline suspension formulation (red; see picture) and fibril (green) forms.	0
Title: Identification and transcriptional organization of aerobactin transport and biosynthesis cluster genes of Vibrio hollisae Abstract: We had previously reported that Vibrio hollisae produces aerobactin in response to iron starvation. In the present study, we identified in V. hollisae ATCC33564 the aerobactin system cluster which consists of eight genes, hatCDB, iucABCD and iutA. The hatCDB genes encode proteins homologous to components of bacterial ATP binding cassette transport systems for ferric aerobactin. The iucABCD and iutA orthologs code for aerobactin biosynthesis enzymes and the ferric aerobactin receptor, respectively. In accordance with their iron-regulated expression, putative Fur box sequences were found within the respective promoter regions of hatC, iucA and iutA. The monocistronic iutA transcript was detected by northern blotting. Moreover, phenotypic comparison between the wild-type strain and its targeted gene disruptants supported the biological functions that were expected for the respective operons and genes on the basis of the homology search. The arrangement of the aerobactin gene clusters thus far found in Vibrio and enterobacterial species was compared and discussed from an evolutionary point of view.	1
Title: You get what you screen for: on the value of fermentation characterization in high-throughput strain improvements in industrial settings Abstract: While design and high-throughput build approaches in biotechnology have increasingly gained attention over the past decade, approaches to test strain performance in high-throughput have received less discussion in the literature. Here, we describe how fermentation characterization can be used to improve the overall efficiency of high-throughput DBTAL (design-build-test-analyze-learn) cycles in an industrial context. Fermentation characterization comprises an in-depth study of strain performance in a bioreactor setting and involves semi-frequent sampling and analytical measurement of substrates, cell densities and viabilities, and (by)products. We describe how fermentation characterization can be used to (1) improve (high-throughput) strain design approaches; (2) enable the development of bench-scale fermentation processes compatible with a wide diversity of strains; and (3) inform the development of high-throughput plate-based strain testing procedures for improved performance at larger scales.	0
Title: Characterization and development of novel small-molecules inhibiting GSK3 and activating Wnt signaling Abstract: Glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) is an essential component of the Wnt signaling pathway and plays important roles in regulating cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. As GSK3 is abnormally upregulated in several diseases including type II diabetes, Alzheimer's disease and cancer, it has been regarded as a potential drug target. During zebrafish development, inhibition of GSK3 leads to ectopic activation of the Wnt pathway, resulting in a headless embryo. Using this phenotype as an assay we screened a chemical library of 4000 compounds and identified one novel compound, 3F8, which specifically inhibits eye and forebrain formation in zebrafish embryos, resembling a typical Wnt overexpression phenotype. Cell reporter assays, chemical informatics analysis and in vitro kinase experiments revealed that 3F8 is a selective GSK3 inhibitor, which is more potent than SB216763, a commonly used GSK3 inhibitor. Based on the structure of 3F8, a new generation of compounds inhibiting GSK3 was synthesized and validated by biological assays. Together, 3F8 and its derivatives could be useful as new reagents and potential therapeutic candidates for GSK3 related diseases.	0
Title: The spa-box for transcriptional activation of subtilin biosynthesis and immunity in Bacillus subtilis Abstract: The subtilin gene cluster (spa) of Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6633 is organized in transcriptional units spaBTC, spaS, spaIFEG and spaRK. Specific binding of the response regulator protein SpaR to spaB, spaS and spaI DNA promoter fragments was shown by means of electromobility shift assays. A repeated pentanucleotide sequence spaced by six nucleotides was identified as SpaR binding motif (spa-box). Saturating mutational analysis of the spa-box by single- and multiple-base-pair substitutions revealed the consensus motif (A/T)TGAT for optimal SpaR binding with the second, third and fifth position being absolutely conservative. Variations in the spacer size between the two pentanucleotide repeats revealed a strong conservation of their relative location. Only DNA with a proximal arrangement of two pentanucleotide repeats showed affinity to SpaR. A 2:1 stoichiometry between SpaR and DNA was obtained by optical biosensor analyses, which corresponds to the binding of two SpaR proteins per spa-box.	1
Title: Proof that the ACTVI genetic region of Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) is involved in stereospecific pyran ring formation in the biosynthesis of actinorhodin Abstract: Pyran ring formation in the biosynthesis of actinorhodin in Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) was studied using the act cluster deficient strain, CH999, carrying pRM5-based plasmids harbouring combinations of the actVI genes. The strain, CH999/pIJ5660 (pRM5 + actVI-ORF1), produced a chiral intermediate, (S)-DNPA, suggesting that the actVI-ORF1 product is a reductase determining the C-3 stereochemical centre.	1
Title: The ArfGAP protein MoGlo3 regulates the development and pathogenicity of Magnaporthe oryzae Abstract: The ADP ribosylation factor (Arf) and the coat protein complex I (COPI) are involved in vesicle transport. Together with GTPase-activating proteins (ArfGAPs) and guanine exchange factors (ArfGEFs) that regulate the activity of Arf, they govern vesicle formation, COPI trafficking and the maintenance of the Golgi complex. In an ongoing effort to study the role of membrane trafficking in pathogenesis of the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae, we identified MoGlo3 as an ArfGAP protein that is homologous to Glo3p of the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. As suspected, MoGlo3 partially complements the function of yeast Glo3p. Consistent with findings in S. cerevisiae, MoGlo3 is localized to the Golgi, and that the localization is dependent on the conserved BoCCS domain. We found that MoGlo3 is highly expressed during conidiation and early infection stages and is required for vegetative growth, conidial production and sexual development. We further found that the ΔMoglo3 mutant is defective in endocytosis, scavenging of the reactive oxygen species, and in the response to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. The combined effects result in failed appressorium function and decreased pathogenicity. Moreover, we provided evidence showing that the domains including the GAP, BoCCS and GRM are all important for normal MoGlo3 functions. Our studies further illustrate the importance of normal membrane trafficking in the physiology and pathogenicity of the rice blast fungus.	0
Title: Analysis of an 8.1-kb DNA fragment contiguous with the erythromycin gene cluster of Saccharopolyspora erythraea in the eryCI-flanking region Abstract: An 8.1-kb region of the Saccharopolyspora erythraea genome, significant for its contiguity to the known genes of the erythromycin biosynthetic gene cluster, was mutationally analyzed and its DNA sequence was determined. The region lies immediately adjacent to eryCI. The newly characterized region is notable for a large, 3.0-kb segment, predicted not to be translated, followed by four probable genes: an acetyltransferase gene, a protease inhibitor gene, a methyltransferase gene, and a transposase gene. Because the probable functions of the genes in this region are not required for erythromycin biosynthesis or resistance and because a deletion of a 6.0-kb portion of this region had no effect on erythromycin biosynthesis, this region marks the outside boundary of the erythromycin gene cluster. Therefore, eryCI represents the end of the cluster. These results complete the analysis of the erythromycin gene cluster and eliminate the possibility that additional sought-after pathway-specific structural or regulatory genes might be found within or adjacent to the cluster.	1
Title: Mechanistic studies of Ser/Thr dehydration catalyzed by a member of the LanL lanthionine synthetase family Abstract: Members of the LanL family of lanthionine synthetases consist of three catalytic domains, an N-terminal pSer/pThr lyase domain, a central Ser/Thr kinase domain, and a C-terminal lanthionine cyclase domain. The N-terminal lyase domain has sequence homology with members of the OspF family of effector proteins. In this study, the residues in the lyase domain of VenL that are conserved in the active site of OspF proteins were mutated to evaluate their importance for catalysis. In addition, residues that are fully conserved in the LanL family but not in the OspF family were mutated. Activity assays with these mutant proteins are consistent with a model in which Lys80 in VenL deprotonates the α-proton of pSer/pThr residues to initiate the elimination reaction. Lys51 is proposed to activate this proton by coordination to the carbonyl of the pSer/pThr, and His53 is believed to protonate the phosphate leaving group. These functions are very similar to the corresponding homologous residues in OspF proteins. On the other hand, recognition of the phosphate group of pSer/pThr appears to be achieved differently in VenL than in the OspF proteins. Arg156 and Lys103 are thought to interact with the phosphate group on the basis of a structural homology model.	1
Title: Biosynthesis of Diverse Type II Polyketide Core Structures in Streptomyces coelicolor M1152 Abstract: Synthetic biology-based approaches have been employed to generate advanced natural product (NP) pathway intermediates to overcome obstacles in NP drug discovery and production. Type II polyketides (PK-IIs) comprise a major subclass of NPs that provide attractive structures for antimicrobial and anticancer drug development. Herein, we have assembled five biosynthetic pathways using a generalized operon design strategy in Streptomyces coelicolor M1152 to allow comparative analysis of metabolite production in an improved heterologous host. The work resulted in production of four distinct PK-II core structures, namely benzoisochromanequinone, angucycline, tetracenomycin, and pentangular compounds, which serve as precursors to diverse pharmaceutically important NPs. Our bottom-up design strategy provided evidence that the biosynthetic pathway of BE-7585A proceeds via an angucycline core structure, instead of rearrangement of an anthracycline aglycone, and led to the discovery of a novel 26-carbon pentangular polyketide. The synthetic biology platform presented here provides an opportunity for further controlled production of diverse PK-IIs in a heterologous host.	0
Title: Structural and functional insight into an unexpectedly selective N-methyltransferase involved in plantazolicin biosynthesis Abstract: Plantazolicin (PZN), a polyheterocyclic, N(α),N(α)-dimethylarginine-containing antibiotic, harbors remarkably specific bactericidal activity toward strains of Bacillus anthracis, the causative agent of anthrax. Previous studies demonstrated that genetic deletion of the S-adenosyl-L-methionine-dependent methyltransferase from the PZN biosynthetic gene cluster results in the formation of desmethylPZN, which is devoid of antibiotic activity. Here we describe the in vitro reconstitution, mutational analysis, and X-ray crystallographic structure of the PZN methyltransferase. Unlike all other known small molecule methyltransferases, which act upon diverse substrates in vitro, the PZN methyltransferase is uncharacteristically limited in substrate scope and functions only on desmethylPZN and close derivatives. The crystal structures of two related PZN methyltransferases, solved to 1.75 Å (Bacillus amyloliquefaciens) and 2.0 Å (Bacillus pumilus), reveal a deep, narrow cavity, putatively functioning as the binding site for desmethylPZN. The narrowness of this cavity provides a framework for understanding the molecular basis of the extreme substrate selectivity. Analysis of a panel of point mutations to the methyltransferase from B. amyloliquefaciens allowed the identification of residues of structural and catalytic importance. These findings further our understanding of one set of orthologous enzymes involved in thiazole/oxazole-modified microcin biosynthesis, a rapidly growing sector of natural products research.	1
Title: Functional characterization of TtnD and TtnF, unveiling new insights into tautomycetin biosynthesis Abstract: The biosynthetic gene cluster for tautomycetin (TTN), a highly potent and selective protein phosphatase (PP) inhibitor isolated from Streptomyces griseochromogenes, has recently been cloned and sequenced. To better understand the transformations responsible for converting the post-polyketide synthase product into the exciting anticancer and immunosuppressive chemotherapeutic candidate TTN, we produced and characterized new analogues resulting from inactivation of two genes, ttnD and ttnF, in S. griseochromogenes. Inactivation of ttnD and ttnF, which encode for putative decarboxylase and dehydratase enzymes, respectively, afforded mutant strains SB13013 and SB13014. The DeltattnD mutant SB13013 accumulated four new TTN analogues, TTN D-1, TTN D-2, TTN D-3, and TTN D-4, whereas the DeltattnF mutant accumulated only one new TTN analogue, TTN F-1. The accumulation of these new TTN analogues defines the function of TtnD and TtnF and the timing of their chemistries in relation to installation of the C5 ketone moiety within TTN. Notably, all new analogues possess a structurally distinguishing carboxylic acid moiety, revealing that TtnD apparently cannot catalyze decarboxylation in the absence of TtnF. Additionally, cytotoxicity and PP inhibition assays reveal the importance of the functional groups installed by TtnDF and, consistent with earlier proposals, the C2''-C5 fragment of TTN to be a critical structural determinant behind the important and unique PP-1 selectivity displayed by TTN.	1
Title: The type II O-antigenic polysaccharide moiety of Burkholderia pseudomallei lipopolysaccharide is required for serum resistance and virulence Abstract: Melioidosis, an infection caused by the gram-negative bacterial pathogen Burkholderia pseudomallei, is endemic in south-east Asia and northern Australia. Acute septicaemic melioidosis is a major cause of morbidity and mortality, especially in north-east Thailand. B. pseudomallei is highly resistant to the bactericidal activity of normal human serum (NHS), and we have found that B. pseudomallei 1026b multiplies in 10-30% NHS. We developed a simple screen for the identification of serum-sensitive mutants based on this novel phenotype. Approximately 1200 Tn5-OT182 mutants were screened, and three serum-sensitive mutants were identified. The type II O-antigenic polysaccharide (O-PS) moiety of lipopolysaccharide was not present in the serum-sensitive mutants. A representative serum-sensitive mutant, SRM117, was killed by the alternative pathway of complement and was less virulent than 1026b in three animal models of melioidosis. The Tn5-OT182 integrations in the serum-sensitive mutants were physically linked on the B. pseudomallei chromosome, and further genetic analysis of this locus revealed a cluster of 15 genes required for type II O-PS production. The proteins encoded by these genes were similar to proteins involved in bacterial polysaccharide biosynthesis. The results presented here demonstrate that type II O-PS is essential for B. pseudomallei serum resistance and virulence.	1
Title: Analysis of the capsule biosynthetic locus of Mannheimia (Pasteurella) haemolytica A1 and proposal of a nomenclature system Abstract: A 16-kbp DNA region that contains genes involved in the biosynthesis of the capsule of Mannheimia (Pasteurella) haemolytica A1 has been characterized. The gene cluster can be divided into three regions like those of the typical group II capsule biosynthetic clusters in gram-negative bacteria. Region 1 contains four genes (wzt, wzm, wzf, and wza) which code for an ATP-binding cassette transport apparatus for the secretion of the capsule materials across the membranes. The M. haemolytica A1 wzt and wzm genes were able to complement Escherichia coli kpsT and kpsM mutants, respectively. Further, the ATP binding activity of Wzt was demonstrated by its affinity for ATP-agarose, and the lipoprotein nature of Wza was supported by [(3)H]palmitate labeling. Region 2 contains six genes; four genes (orf1/2/3/4) code for unique functions for which no homologues have been identified to date. The remaining two genes (nmaA and nmaB) code for homologues of UDP-N-acetylglucosamine-2-epimerase and UDP-N-acetylmannosamine dehydrogenase, respectively. These two proteins are highly homologous to the E. coli WecB and WecC proteins (formerly known as RffE and RffD), which are involved in the biosynthesis of enterobacterial common antigen (ECA). Complementation of an E. coli rffE/D mutant with the M. haemolytica A1 nmaA/B genes resulted in the restoration of ECA biosynthesis. Region 3 contains two genes (wbrA and wbrB) which are suggested to be involved in the phospholipid modification of capsular materials.	1
Title: The mystery of missing heritability: Genetic interactions create phantom heritability Abstract: Human genetics has been haunted by the mystery of "missing heritability" of common traits. Although studies have discovered >1,200 variants associated with common diseases and traits, these variants typically appear to explain only a minority of the heritability. The proportion of heritability explained by a set of variants is the ratio of (i) the heritability due to these variants (numerator), estimated directly from their observed effects, to (ii) the total heritability (denominator), inferred indirectly from population data. The prevailing view has been that the explanation for missing heritability lies in the numerator--that is, in as-yet undiscovered variants. While many variants surely remain to be found, we show here that a substantial portion of missing heritability could arise from overestimation of the denominator, creating "phantom heritability." Specifically, (i) estimates of total heritability implicitly assume the trait involves no genetic interactions (epistasis) among loci; (ii) this assumption is not justified, because models with interactions are also consistent with observable data; and (iii) under such models, the total heritability may be much smaller and thus the proportion of heritability explained much larger. For example, 80% of the currently missing heritability for Crohn's disease could be due to genetic interactions, if the disease involves interaction among three pathways. In short, missing heritability need not directly correspond to missing variants, because current estimates of total heritability may be significantly inflated by genetic interactions. Finally, we describe a method for estimating heritability from isolated populations that is not inflated by genetic interactions.	0
Title: Caulosegnins I-III: a highly diverse group of lasso peptides derived from a single biosynthetic gene cluster Abstract: Lasso peptides are natural products of ribosomal origin with a unique knotted structural fold. Even though only a few of them are known, recent reports of newly isolated lasso peptides were scarce. In this work, we report the identification of a novel lasso peptide gene cluster from Caulobacter segnis, that produces three new lasso peptides (caulosegnins I, II, and III) using a single biosynthetic machinery. These lasso peptides possess different ring sizes and amino acid sequences. In this study, we have developed a system for enhanced lasso peptide production to allow isolation of these compounds through heterologous expression in Escherichia coli. We were able to elucidate the structure of the most abundant lasso peptide caulosegnin I via NMR spectroscopic analysis and performed a thorough mutational analysis that gave insight into their biosynthesis and revealed important factors affecting the stabilization of the lasso fold in general. The caulosegnins also show a diverse behavior when subjected to thermal denaturation, which is exceptional as all lasso peptides were believed to have an intrinsic high thermal stability.	1
Title: Hancockiamides: phenylpropanoid piperazines from Aspergillus hancockii are biosynthesised by a versatile dual single-module NRPS pathway Abstract: The hancockiamides are an unusual new family of N-cinnamoylated piperazines from the Australian soil fungus Aspergillus hancockii. Genomic analyses of A. hancockii identified a biosynthetic gene cluster (hkm) of 12 genes, including two single-module nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) genes. Heterologous expression of the hkm cluster in A. nidulans confirmed its role in the biosynthesis of the hancockiamides. We further demonstrated that a novel cytochrome P450, Hkm5, catalyses the methylenedioxy bridge formation, and that the PAL gene hkm12 is dispensable, but contributes to increased production of the cinnamoylated hancockiamides. In vitro enzymatic assays and substrate feeding studies demonstrated that NRPS Hkm11 activates and transfers trans-cinnamate to the piperazine scaffold and has flexibility to accept bioisosteric thienyl and furyl analogues. This is the first reported cinnamate-activating fungal NRPS. Expression of a truncated cluster lacking the acetyltransferase gene led to seven additional congeners, including an unexpected family of 2,5-dibenzylpiperazines. These pleiotropic effects highlight the plasticity of the pathway and the power of this approach for accessing novel natural product scaffolds.	1
Title: Organization and nucleotide sequences of two lactococcal bacteriocin operons Abstract: Two distinct regions of the Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris 9B4 plasmid p9B4-6, each of which specified bacteriocin production as well as immunity, have been sequenced and analyzed by deletion and frameshift mutation analyses. On a 1.8-kb ScaI-ClaI fragment specifying low antagonistic activity, three open reading frames (ORFs) were present, which were organized in an operon. The first two ORFs, containing 69 and 77 codons, respectively, were involved in bacteriocin activity, whereas the third ORF, containing 154 codons, was essential for immunity. Primer extension analysis indicated the presence of a promoter upstream of the ORFs. Two ORFs were present on a 1.3-kb ScaI-HindII fragment specifying high antagonistic activity. The first ORF, containing 75 codons, specified bacteriocin activity. The second ORF, containing 98 codons, specified immunity. The nucleotide sequences of both fragments upstream of the first ORFs as well as the first 20 bp of the first ORF of both bacteriocin operons appeared to be identical.	1
Title: Synthesis of a backbone hexasaccharide fragment of the pectic polysaccharide rhamnogalacturonan I Abstract: Synthesis of the fully unprotected hexasaccharide backbone of the pectic polysaccharide rhamnogalacturonan I is described. The strategy relies on iterative coupling of a common pentenyl disaccharide glycosyl donor followed by a late-stage oxidation of the C-6 positions of the galactose residues. The disaccharide donor is prepared by an efficient chemoselective armed-disarmed coupling of a thiophenyl rhamnoside donor with a pentenyl galactoside acceptor bearing the strongly electron-withdrawing pentafluorobenzoyl ester (PFBz) protective group.	0
Title: Antimicrobial Activity of SCH 27899, Oligosaccharide Member of the Everninomycin Class with a Wide Gram-Positive Spectrum Abstract: The in vitro antimicrobial activity of SCH 27899 (everninomycin), a novel oligosaccharide compound of the everninomycin class, was compared with vancomycin, chloramphenicol, clinafloxacin, teicoplanin and doxycycline against 428 clinical strains of bacteria. Everninomycin base exhibited the greatest antimicrobial activity compared to other formulations against all strains tested (MIC90: 0.25 microg/ml) followed by clinafloxacin and teicoplanin (MIC90: 0.5 microg/ml), vancomycin (MIC90: 2 microg/ml), and doxycycline (MIC90: 16 microg/ml). Everninomycin demonstrated the best activity against Streptococcus spp. (serogroups A, B, C, F, G) and Streptococcus pneumoniae, and lower activity against coagulase-negative staphylococci (MIC90: 0.5 microg/ml). All enterococci had an everninomycin MIC of 0.5 microg/ml or less. Everninomycin had no measurable antimicrobial activity against gram-negative aerobic organisms except Flavobacterium meningosepticum (MIC50: 2 microg/ml). Some everninomycin activity was observed against Clostridium spp., Peptostreptococcus spp., and the Prevotella bivius-disiens group. Everninomycin showed excellent activity (MIC90: 0.25 microg/ml) against the fluoroquinolone-resistant strains and all gram-positive strains resistant to vancomycin (MICs less-than-or-equal 4 microg/ml). The MBC/MIC ratios and killing curve data suggest that everninomycin is not uniformly or rapidly bactericidal. These in vitro data indicate that everninomycin could be useful against emerging gram-positive strains resistant to other contemporary antimicrobials.	1
Title: Specific small molecule inhibitors of Skp2-mediated p27 degradation Abstract: In the ubiquitin proteasome system, the E3 ligase SCF-Skp2 and its accessory protein, Cks1, promote proliferation largely by inducing the degradation of the CDK inhibitor p27. Overexpression of Skp2 in human cancers correlates with poor prognosis, and deregulation of SCF-Skp2-Cks1 promotes tumorigenesis in animal models. We identified small molecule inhibitors specific to SCF-Skp2 activity using in silico screens targeted to the binding interface for p27. These compounds selectively inhibited Skp2-mediated p27 degradation by reducing p27 binding through key compound-receptor contacts. In cancer cells, the compounds induced p27 accumulation in a Skp2-dependent manner and promoted cell-type-specific blocks in the G1 or G2/M phases. Designing SCF-Skp2-specific inhibitors may be a novel strategy to treat cancers dependent on the Skp2-p27 axis.	0
Title: Klebsazolicin inhibits 70S ribosome by obstructing the peptide exit tunnel Abstract: Whereas screening of the small-molecule metabolites produced by most cultivatable microorganisms often results in the rediscovery of known compounds, genome-mining programs allow researchers to harness much greater chemical diversity, and result in the discovery of new molecular scaffolds. Here we report the genome-guided identification of a new antibiotic, klebsazolicin (KLB), from Klebsiella pneumoniae that inhibits the growth of sensitive cells by targeting ribosomes. A ribosomally synthesized post-translationally modified peptide (RiPP), KLB is characterized by the presence of a unique N-terminal amidine ring that is essential for its activity. Biochemical in vitro studies indicate that KLB inhibits ribosomes by interfering with translation elongation. Structural analysis of the ribosome-KLB complex showed that the compound binds in the peptide exit tunnel overlapping with the binding sites of macrolides or streptogramin-B. KLB adopts a compact conformation and largely obstructs the tunnel. Engineered KLB fragments were observed to retain in vitro activity, and thus have the potential to serve as a starting point for the development of new bioactive compounds.	1
Title: Biosynthesis of helvolic acid and identification of an unusual C-4-demethylation process distinct from sterol biosynthesis Abstract: Fusidane-type antibiotics represented by helvolic acid, fusidic acid and cephalosporin P1 are a class of bacteriostatic agents, which have drawn renewed attention because they have no cross-resistance to commonly used antibiotics. However, their biosynthesis is poorly understood. Here, we perform a stepwise introduction of the nine genes from the proposed gene cluster for helvolic acid into Aspergillus oryzae NSAR1, which enables us to isolate helvolic acid (~20 mg L-1) and its 21 derivatives. Anti-Staphylococcus aureus assay reveals that the antibacterial activity of three intermediates is even stronger than that of helvolic acid. Notably, we observe an unusual C-4 demethylation process mediated by a promiscuous short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (HelC) and a cytochrome P450 enzyme (HelB1), which is distinct from the common sterol biosynthesis. These studies have set the stage for using biosynthetic approaches to expand chemical diversity of fusidane-type antibiotics.	1
Title: Thioesterase-mediated side chain transesterification generates potent Gq signaling inhibitor FR900359 Abstract: The potent and selective Gq protein inhibitor depsipeptide FR900359 (FR), originally discovered as the product of an uncultivable plant endosymbiont, is synthesized by a complex biosynthetic system comprising two nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) assembly lines. Here we characterize a cultivable bacterial FR producer, enabling detailed investigations into biosynthesis and attachment of the functionally important FR side chain. We reconstitute side chain assembly by the monomodular NRPS FrsA and the non-heme monooxygenase FrsH, and characterize intermolecular side chain transesterification to the final macrocyclic intermediate FR-Core, mediated by the FrsA thioesterase domain. We harness FrsA substrate promiscuity to generate FR analogs with altered side chains and demonstrate indispensability of the FR side chain for efficient Gq inhibition by comparative bioactivity, toxicity and docking studies. Finally, evolution of FR and side chain biosynthesis is discussed based on bioinformatics analyses. Side chain transesterification boosts potency and target affinity of selective Gq inhibitor natural products.	1
Title: Molecular cloning and identification of the laspartomycin biosynthetic gene cluster from Streptomyces viridochromogenes Abstract: The biosynthetic gene cluster for laspartomycins, a family of 11 amino acid peptide antibiotics, has been cloned and sequenced from Streptomyces viridochromogenes ATCC 29814. Annotation of a segment of 88912bp of S. viridochromogenes genomic sequence revealed the putative lpm cluster and its flanking regions which harbor 43 open reading frames. The lpm cluster, which spans approximately 60 kb, consists of 21 open reading frames. Those include four NRPS genes (lpmA/orf18, lpmB/orf25, lpmC/orf26 and lpmD/orf27), four genes (orfs 21, 22, 24 and 29) involved in the lipid tail biosynthesis and attachment, four regulatory genes (orfs 13, 19, 32 and 33) and three putative exporters or self-resistance genes (orfs 14, 20 and 30). In addition, the gene involved in the biosynthesis of the nonproteinogenic amino acid Pip was also identified in the lpm cluster while the genes necessary for the biosynthesis of the rare residue diaminopropionic acid (Dap) were found to reside elsewhere on the chromosome. Interestingly, the dabA, dabB and dabC genes predicted to code for the biosynthesis of the unusual amino acid diaminobutyric acid (Dab) are organized into the lpm cluster even though the Dab residue was not found in the laspartomycins. Disruption of the NRPS lpmC gene completely abolished laspartomycin production in the corresponding mutant strain. These findings will allow molecular engineering and combinatorial biosynthesis approaches to expand the structural diversity of the amphomycin-group peptide antibiotics including the laspartomycins and friulimicins.	1
Title: Biosynthetic pathway toward carbohydrate-like moieties of alnumycins contains unusual steps for C-C bond formation and cleavage Abstract: Carbohydrate moieties are important components of natural products, which are often imperative for the solubility and biological activity of the compounds. The aromatic polyketide alnumycin A contains an extraordinary sugar-like 4'-hydroxy-5'-hydroxymethyl-2',7'-dioxane moiety attached via a carbon-carbon bond to the aglycone. Here we have extensively investigated the biosynthesis of the dioxane unit through (13)C labeling studies, gene inactivation experiments and enzymatic synthesis. We show that AlnA and AlnB, members of the pseudouridine glycosidase and haloacid dehalogenase enzyme families, respectively, catalyze C-ribosylation conceivably through Michael-type addition of d-ribose-5-phosphate and dephosphorylation. The ribose moiety may be attached both in furanose (alnumycin C) and pyranose (alnumycin D) forms. The C(1')-C(2') bond of alnumycin C is subsequently cleaved and the ribose unit is rearranged into an unprecedented dioxolane (cis-bicyclo[3.3.0]-2',4',6'-trioxaoctan-3'β-ol) structure present in alnumycin B. The reaction is catalyzed by Aln6, which belongs to a previously uncharacterized enzyme family. The conversion was accompanied with consumption of O(2) and formation of H(2)O(2), which allowed us to propose that the reaction may proceed via hydroxylation of C1' followed by retro-aldol cleavage and acetal formation. Interestingly, no cofactors could be detected and the reaction was also conducted in the presence of metal chelating agents. The last step is the conversion of alnumycin B into the final end-product alnumycin A catalyzed by Aln4, an NADPH-dependent aldo-keto reductase. This characterization of the dioxane biosynthetic pathway sets the basis for the utilization of C-C bound ribose, dioxolane and dioxane moieties in the generation of improved biologically active compounds.	1
Title: Metabolic diversity in myxobacteria: identification of the myxalamid and the stigmatellin biosynthetic gene cluster of Stigmatella aurantiaca Sg a15 and a combined polyketide-(poly)peptide gene cluster from the epothilone producing strain Sorangium cellulosum So ce90 Abstract: Myxobacterial strains producing polyketides (PKs) assumed to be biosynthesized by a type I polyketide synthase (PKS) were analysed. Myxobacteria also produce a variety of polypeptides (PP) and PKs with incorporated amino acids ('mixed PK-PP'). In order to be able to identify the biosynthetic gene clusters for these metabolites a PCR based approach has been developed to clone ketosynthase (KS) domains of PKS genes from these organisms. Conserved regions of peptide synthetases of the non-ribosomal type (NRPS) were also amplified via PCR. KS fragments from Stigmatella aurantiaca Sg a15 were used for chromosomal gene inactivation experiments resulting in a series of mutants including such that were unable to produce stigmatellins and myxalamids. A NRPS fragment and PKS fragments from Sorangium cellulosum So ce90 were used to identify cosmids hybridizing with both types of probes from a genomic library. Both a NRPS and a PKS fragment were cloned and sequenced from a relatively short restriction fragment of one of these cosmids. The method described here should be very useful to clone and identify PKS, NRPS and mixed PKS-NRPS from myxobacteria in general and thereby open opportunities to use the biochemical diversity of these bacteria for genetic engineering and combinatorial biosynthesis.	1
Title: Discovery of a novel analogue of FR901533 and the corresponding biosynthetic gene cluster from Streptosporangium roseum No. 79089 Abstract: FR901533 (1, also known as WS79089B), WS79089A (2), and WS79089C (3) are polycyclic aromatic natural products with promising inhibitory activity to endothelin-converting enzymes. In this work, we isolated five tridecaketide products from Streptosporangium roseum No. 79089, including 1-3, benaphthamycin (4) and a novel FR901533 analogue (5). The structure of 5 was characterized based on spectroscopic data. Compared with the major product 2, the new compound 5 has an additional hydroxyl group at C-12 and an extra methyl group at the 13-OH. The configuration of C-19 of these compounds was determined to be R using Mosher's method. A putative biosynthetic gene cluster for compounds 1-5 was discovered by analyzing the genome of S. roseum No. 79089. This 38.6-kb gene cluster contains 38 open reading frames, including a minimal polyketide synthase (wsaA-C), an aromatase (wsaD), three cyclases (wsaE, F, and W), and a series of tailoring enzymes such as monooxygenases (wsaO1-O7) and methyltransferases (wsaM1 and M2). Disruption of the ketosynthase gene (wsaA) in this gene cluster abolished the production of 1-5, confirming that this gene cluster is indeed responsible for the biosynthesis of 1-5. A type II polyketide biosynthetic pathway was proposed for this group of natural endothelin-converting enzyme inhibitors. KEY POINTS: • Five aromatic tridecaketides were isolated from Streptosporangium roseum No. 79089. • A novel FR901533 analogue, 12-hydroxy-13-O-methyl-WS79089A, was characterized. • The absolute configuration of C-19 of FR901533 and analogues was determined. • The biosynthetic gene cluster of FR901533 and analogues was discovered.	1
Title: Mechanism of enzymatic fluorination in Streptomyces cattleya Abstract: Recently a fluorination enzyme was identified and isolated from Streptomyces cattleya, as the first committed step on the metabolic pathway to the fluorinated metabolites, fluoroacetate and 4-fluorothreonine. This enzyme, 5'-fluoro-5'-deoxy adenosine synthetase (FDAS), has been shown to catalyze C-F bond formation by nucleophilic attack of fluoride ion to S-adenosyl-l-methionine (SAM) with the concomitant displacement of l-methionine to generate 5'-fluoro-5'-deoxy adenosine (5'-FDA). Although the structures of FDAS bound to both SAM and products have been solved, the molecular mechanism remained to be elucidated. We now report site-directed mutagenesis studies, structural analyses, and isothermal calorimetry (ITC) experiments. The data establish the key residues required for catalysis and the order of substrate binding. Fluoride ion is not readily distinguished from water by protein X-ray crystallography; however, using chloride ion (also a substrate) with a mutant of low activity has enabled the halide ion to be located in nonproductive co-complexes with SAH and SAM. The kinetic data suggest the positively charged sulfur of SAM is a key requirement in stabilizing the transition state. We propose a molecular mechanism for FDAS in which fluoride weakly associates with the enzyme exchanging two water molecules for protein ligation. The binding of SAM expels remaining water associated with fluoride ion and traps the ion in a pocket positioned to react with SAM, generating l-methionine and 5'-FDA. l-methionine then dissociates from the enzyme followed by 5'-FDA.	0
Title: Butyrivibriocin AR10, a new cyclic bacteriocin produced by the ruminal anaerobe Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens AR10: characterization of the gene and peptide Abstract: The gene (bviA) encoding the ruminal bacteriocin butyrivibriocin AR10 was cloned from an EcoRI library by using an oligonucleotide probe based on a partial peptide sequence of the previously isolated peptide. The gene encoded an 80 amino acid prebacteriocin that demonstrated significant identity with the cyclic bacteriocin gassericin A. Negative ion time of flight mass spectroscopic analysis (ESI/MS) indicated a mass of 5981.5 Da for the isolated bacteriocin, a molecular mass that could not be generated by removal of a leader peptide alone. However, an N- to C-terminal cyclization of the predicted mature bacteriocin resulted in a peptide that conformed to the determined mass and charge characteristics. Northern blotting confirmed that expression of bviA mirrored the production of the bacteriocin in both liquid and solid media.	1
Title: Quercetin affects uterine smooth muscle contractile activity in gilts Abstract: Quercetin is a polyphenolic flavonoid occurring in leaves, stems, flowers and fruits of many plants. In traditional Chinese medicine, it is used as a natural therapeutic agent with a broad spectrum of activities (antioxidant, neuroprotective, anti-inflammatory, anticancer, antibacterial and antiviral). Moreover, quercetin affects function of the reproductive tract, however the knowledge of this activity is still fragmentary. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the influence of quercetin on the contractile activity of the porcine myometrium collected from immature (n = 6), cyclic (n = 6) and early pregnant (n = 6) gilts. Strips of the myometrium (comprising longitudinal and circular layer) were resected from the middle part of the uterine horns and the isometric contractions were recorded. After 60-90 min of preincubation, the strips were stimulated with quercetin in increasing (10-13-10-1 M) concentrations and the changes in the tension amplitude and frequency of contractions were measured. Quercetin decreased (P<0.01-0.001) the amplitude of contractions at concentrations 10-11-10-1 M and 10-10-10-1 M in cyclic and early pregnant groups, respectively. The frequency of contractions decreased in all groups but was the highest (at concentrations 10-11-10-1 M; P<0.05-0.001) in the cyclic group and the lowest (at concentrations 10-5-10-1 M; P<0.01) in the immature group. The tension decreased only in the cyclic group after quercetin administration in high concentrations (10-6-10-1 M; P<0.05-0.01). The results indicate that quercetin causes relaxation of the porcine uterine smooth muscle but this activity is strongly related to the physiological status of the gilts.	0
Title: Construction of a bacterial artificial chromosome library for a myxobacterium of the genus Cystobacter and characterization of an antibiotic biosynthetic gene cluster Abstract: A bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) library was constructed to isolate the biosynthetic gene cluster for the polyketide/peptide hybrid-type antibiotic cystothiazole A from the myxobacterium Cystobacter fuscus strain AJ-13278. Sequence analysis of a 63.9 kb contiguous region that encompasses the biosynthetic gene cluster (cta) led to the identification of a polyketide synthase (PKS)/nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) hybrid gene cluster 32.1 kb in size, which consists of six open reading frames (ORFs), ctaB to ctaG, as well as downstream genes ctaJ and ctaK (1.0 and 0.9 kb, respectively) responsible for the final biosynthetic steps. The genes ctaB, ctaE, and ctaF encode PKSs, the genes ctaC and ctaG encode NRPSs, and ctaD encodes an NRPS-PKS hybrid enzyme. Disruption of ctaD impaired cystothiazole A production. Additionally, two downstream genes, ctaJ and ctaK, which encode a nitrilase and an O-methyltransferase, respectively, must be responsible for the final methyl ester formation in the cystothiazole A biosynthesis.	1
Title: Bacterial communities in different sections of a municipal wastewater treatment plant revealed by 16S rDNA 454 pyrosequencing Abstract: In this study, we successfully demonstrated that 454 pyrosequencing was a powerful approach for investigating the bacterial communities in the activated sludge, digestion sludge, influent, and effluent samples of a full scale wastewater treatment plant treating saline sewage. For each sample, 18,808 effective sequences were selected and utilized to do the bacterial diversity and abundance analysis. In total, 2,455, 794, 1,667, and 1,932 operational taxonomic units were obtained at 3 % distance cutoff in the activated sludge, digestion sludge, influent, and effluent samples, respectively. The corresponding most dominant classes in the four samples are Alphaproteobacteria, Thermotogae, Deltaproteobacteria, and Gammaproteobacteria. About 67 % sequences in the digestion sludge sample were found to be affiliated with the Thermotogales order. Also, these sequences were assigned into a recently proposed genus Kosmotoga by the Ribosomal Database Project classifier. In the effluent sample, we found high abundance of Mycobacterium and Vibrio, which are genera containing pathogenic bacteria. Moreover, in this study, we proposed a method to differentiate the "gene percentage" and "cell percentage" by using Ribosomal RNA Operon Copy Number Database.	0
Title: Bacillus subtilis as heterologous host for the secretory production of the non-ribosomal cyclodepsipeptide enniatin Abstract: The heterologous expression of genes or gene clusters in microbial hosts, followed by metabolic engineering of biosynthetic pathways, is key to access industrially and pharmaceutically relevant compounds in an economically affordable and sustainable manner. Therefore, platforms need to be developed, which provide tools for the controlled synthesis of bioactive compounds. The Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis is a promising candidate for such applications, as it is generally regarded as a safe production host, its physiology is well investigated and a variety of tools is available for its genetic manipulation. Furthermore, this industrially relevant bacterium provides a high secretory potential not only for enzymes but also for primary and secondary metabolites. In this study, we present the first heterologous expression of an eukaryotic non-ribosomal peptide synthetase gene (esyn) coding for the biosynthesis of the small molecule enniatin in B. subtilis. Enniatin is a pharmaceutically used cyclodepsipeptide for treatment of topical bacterial and fungal infections. We generated various enniatin-producing B. subtilis strains, allowing for either single chromosomal or plasmid-based multi-copy expression of the esyn cluster under the control of an acetoin-inducible promoter system. Optimization of cultivation conditions, combined with modifications of the genetic background and multi-copy plasmid-based esyn expression, resulted in a secretory production of enniatin B. This work presents B. subtilis as a suitable host for the expression of heterologous eukaryotic non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPS) clusters.	0
Title: The surface layer (S-layer) glycoprotein of Geobacillus stearothermophilus NRS 2004/3a. Analysis of its glycosylation Abstract: Geobacillus stearothermophilus NRS 2004/3a possesses an oblique surface layer (S-layer) composed of glycoprotein subunits as the outermost component of its cell wall. In addition to the elucidation of the complete S-layer glycan primary structure and the determination of the glycosylation sites, the structural gene sgsE encoding the S-layer protein was isolated by polymerase chain reaction-based techniques. The open reading frame codes for a protein of 903 amino acids, including a leader sequence of 30 amino acids. The mature S-layer protein has a calculated molecular mass of 93,684 Da and an isoelectric point of 6.1. Glycosylation of SgsE was investigated by means of chemical analyses, 600-MHz nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry. Glycopeptides obtained after Pronase digestion revealed the glycan structure [-->2)-alpha-L-Rhap-(1-->3)-beta-L-Rhap-(1-->2)-alpha-L-Rhap-(1-->](n = 13-18), with a 2-O-methyl group capping the terminal trisaccharide repeating unit at the non-reducing end of the glycan chains. The glycan chains are bound via the disaccharide core -->3)-alpha-l-Rhap-(1-->3)-alpha-L-Rhap-(L--> and the linkage glycose beta-D-Galp in O-glycosidic linkages to the S-layer protein SgsE at positions threonine 620 and serine 794. This S-layer glycoprotein contains novel linkage regions and is the first one among eubacteria whose glycosylation sites have been characterized.	1
Title: Quantitative glycomics from fluidic glycan microarrays Abstract: A hallmark of cell-surface processes involving glycans is their multivalent interaction with glycan binding proteins (GBPs). Such a multivalent interaction depends critically on the mobility and density of signaling molecules on the membrane surface. While glycan microarrays have been used in exploring multivalent interactions, the lack of mobility and the difficulty in controlling surface density both limit their quantitative applications. Here we apply a fluidic glycan microarray, with glycan density varying for orders of magnitude, to profile cell surface interaction using a model system, the adhesion of Escherichia coli to mannose. We show the quantitative determination of monovalent and multivalent adhesion channels; the latter can be inhibited by nanopartices presenting a high density of mannosyl groups. These results reveal a new E. coli adhesion mechanism: the switching in the FimH adhesion protein avidity from monovalent to multivalent as the density of mobile mannosyl groups increases; such avidity switching enhances binding affinity and triggers multiple fimbriae anchoring. Affinity enhancement toward FimH has only been observed before for oligo-mannose due to the turn on of secondary interactions outside the mannose binding pocket. We suggest that the new mechanism revealed by the fluidic microarray is of general significance to cell surface interactions: the dynamic clustering of simple sugar groups (homogeneous or heterogeneous) on the fluidic membrane surface may simulate the functions of complex glycan molecules.	0
Title: TLN-05220, TLN-05223, new Echinosporamicin-type antibiotics, and proposed revision of the structure of bravomicins(*) Abstract: The deposited strain of the hazimicin producer, Micromonospora echinospora ssp. challisensis NRRL 12255 has considerable biosynthetic capabilities as revealed by genome scanning. Among these is a locus containing both type I and type II PKS genes. The presumed products of this locus, TLN-05220 (1) and TLN-05223 (2), bear a core backbone composed of six fused rings starting with a 2-pyridone moiety. The structures were confirmed by conventional spectral analyses including MS, and 1D and 2D NMR experiments. Comparison of both the 1H and 13C NMR data of the newly isolated compound with those of echinosporamicin and bravomicin A led us to propose a revision of the structure of the latter to include a 2-pyridone instead of the pyran originally postulated. Both compounds (1 and 2) possessed strong antibacterial activity against a series of gram-positive pathogens including several strains of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant Enterococci (VRE), and cytotoxic activities against several human tumor cell lines. The TLN compounds are the first of this group with reported anticancer activity.	1
Title: Streamlined syntheses of (-)-dictyostatin, 16-desmethyl-25,26-dihydrodictyostatin, and 6-epi-16-desmethyl-25,26-dihydrodictyostatin Abstract: The dictyostatins are a promising class of potential anti-cancer drugs because they are powerful microtubule-stabilizing agents, but the complexity of their chemical structures is a severe impediment to their further development. On the basis of both synthetic and medicinal chemistry analyses, 16-desmethyl-25,26-dihydrodictyostatin and its C6 epimer were chosen as potentially potent yet accessible dictyostatin analogues, and three new syntheses were developed. A relatively classical synthesis involving vinyllithium addition and macrocyclization gave way to a newer and more practical approach based on esterification and ring-closing metathesis reaction. Finally, aspects of these two approaches were combined to provide a third new synthesis based on esterification and Nozaki-Hiyama-Kishi reaction. This was used to prepare the target dihydro analogues and the natural product. All of the syntheses are streamlined because of their high convergency. The work provided several new analogues of dictyostatin, including a truncated macrolactone and a C10 E-alkene, which were 400- and 50-fold less active than (-)-dictyostatin, respectively. In contrast, the targeted 16-desmethyl-25,26-dihydrodictyostatin analogues retained almost complete activity in preliminary biological assays.	0
Title: Photooxidation of mixed aryl and biarylphosphines Abstract: Arylphosphines and dialkylbiarylphosphines react with singlet oxygen to form phosphine oxides and phosphinate esters. For mixed arylphosphines, the most electron-rich aryl group migrates to form the phosphinate, while for dialkylbiarylphosphines migration of the alkyl group occurs. Dialkylbiarylphosphines also yield arene epoxides, especially in electron-rich systems. Phosphinate ester formation is increased at high temperature, while protic solvents increase the yield of epoxide. The product distribution provides evidence for Buchwald's recent conformational model for the aerobic oxidation of dialkylbiarylphosphines.	0
Title: Efficient and Reproducible Multigene Expression after Single-Step Transfection Using Improved BAC Transgenesis and Engineering Toolkit Abstract: Achieving stable expression of a single transgene in mammalian cells remains challenging; even more challenging is obtaining simultaneous stable expression of multiple transgenes at reproducible, relative expression levels. Previously, we attained copy-number-dependent, chromosome-position-independent expression of reporter minigenes by embedding them within a BAC "scaffold" containing the mouse Msh3-Dhfr locus (DHFR BAC). Here, we extend this "BAC TG-EMBED" approach. First, we report a toolkit of endogenous promoters capable of driving transgene expression over a 0.01- to 5-fold expression range relative to the CMV promoter, allowing fine-tuning of relative expression levels of multiple reporter genes. Second, we demonstrate little variation in expression level and long-term expression stability of a reporter gene embedded in BACs containing either transcriptionally active or inactive genomic regions, making the choice of BAC scaffolds more flexible. Third, we present a novel BAC assembly scheme, "BAC-MAGIC", for inserting multiple transgenes into BAC scaffolds, which is much more time-efficient than traditional galK-based methods. As a proof-of-principle for our improved BAC TG-EMBED toolkit, we simultaneously fluorescently labeled three nuclear compartments at reproducible, relative intensity levels in 94% of stable clones after a single transfection using a DHFR BAC scaffold containing 4 transgenes assembled with BAC-MAGIC. Our extended BAC TG-EMBED toolkit and BAC-MAGIC method provide an efficient, versatile platform for stable simultaneous expression of multiple transgenes at reproducible, relative levels.	0
Title: Posttranscriptional regulation by light of the steady-state levels of mature B800-850 light-harvesting complexes in Rhodobacter capsulatus Abstract: Photosynthetic organisms exhibit a variety of responses to changes in light intensity, including differential biosynthesis of chlorophyll-protein complexes. Cultures of Rhodobacter capsulatus grown anaerobically with a low intensity of light (2 W/m2) contained about four times as much B800-850 light-harvesting complex as cells grown under high light intensity (140 W/m2). The mRNA transcripts encoding B800-850 beta and alpha peptides were analyzed by Northern blot (RNA blot), S1 nuclease protection, and capping with guanylyl transferase. It was found that the steady-state levels of B800-850 mRNAs in high-light-grown cultures were about four times as great as in cells grown under low light intensity. Therefore, the lesser amounts of mature B800-850 peptide gene products found in cells grown with high light intensity are the result of a posttranscriptional regulatory process. It was also found that there are two polycistronic messages encoding the B800-850 peptides. These messages share a common 3' terminus but differ in their 5'-end segments as a result of transcription initiation at two discrete sites. Moreover, the half-lives of B800-850 mRNAs were about 10 min in cells grown with high light and approximately 19 min in cultures grown with low light. It is concluded that there must be more frequent initiations of transcription of B800-850 genes in cells grown with high light than in those grown with low light, and that the relative amounts of B800-850 complexes under these conditions are controlled by a translational or posttranslational mechanism.	0
Title: Functional analysis of the validamycin biosynthetic gene cluster and engineered production of validoxylamine A Abstract: A 45 kb DNA sequencing analysis from Streptomyces hygroscopicus 5008 involved in validamycin A (VAL-A) biosynthesis revealed 16 structural genes, 2 regulatory genes, 5 genes related transport, transposition/integration or tellurium resistance; another 4 genes had no obvious identity. The VAL-A biosynthetic pathway was proposed, with assignment of the required genetic functions confined to the sequenced region. A cluster of eight reassembled genes was found to support VAL-A synthesis in a heterologous host, S. lividans 1326. In vivo inactivation of the putative glycosyltransferase gene (valG) abolished the final attachment of glucose for VAL production and resulted in accumulation of the VAL-A precursor, validoxylamine, while the normal production of VAL-A could be restored by complementation with valG. The role of valG in the glycosylation of validoxylamine to VAL-A was demonstrated in vitro by enzymatic assay.	1
Title: Genome analysis and polar tube firing dynamics of mosquito-infecting microsporidia Abstract: Microsporidia are highly divergent fungi that are obligate intracellular pathogens of a wide range of host organisms. Here we review recent findings from the genome sequences of mosquito-infecting microsporidian species Edhazardia aedis and Vavraia culicis, which show large differences in genome size, although similar numbers of predicted genes. We also show a video of E. aedis polar tube firing, which is the dramatic mechanism used by microsporidia to deliver the germ cell (sporoplasm) into the host cell to initiate intracellular infection.	0
Title: Selective chemical treatment of cellular microdomains using multiple laminar streams Abstract: There are many experiments in which it would be useful to treat a part of the surface or interior of a cell with a biochemical reagent. It is difficult, however, to achieve subcellular specificity, because small molecules diffuse distances equal to the extent of the cell in seconds. This paper demonstrates experimentally, and analyzes theoretically, the use of multiple laminar fluid streams in microfluidic channels to deliver reagents to, and remove them from, cells with subcellular spatial selectivity. The technique made it possible to label different subpopulations of mitochondria fluorescently, to disrupt selected regions of the cytoskeleton chemically, to dislodge limited areas of cell-substrate adhesions enzymatically, and to observe microcompartmental endocytosis within individual cells. This technique does not require microinjection or immobilization of reagents onto nondiffusive objects; it opens a new window into cell biology.	0
Title: Targeted capture and heterologous expression of the Pseudoalteromonas alterochromide gene cluster in Escherichia coli represents a promising natural product exploratory platform Abstract: Marine pseudoalteromonads represent a very promising source of biologically important natural product molecules. To access and exploit the full chemical capacity of these cosmopolitan Gram-(-) bacteria, we sought to apply universal synthetic biology tools to capture, refactor, and express biosynthetic gene clusters for the production of complex organic compounds in reliable host organisms. Here, we report a platform for the capture of proteobacterial gene clusters using a transformation-associated recombination (TAR) strategy coupled with direct pathway manipulation and expression in Escherichia coli. The ~34 kb pathway for production of alterochromide lipopeptides by Pseudoalteromonas piscicida JCM 20779 was captured and heterologously expressed in E. coli utilizing native and E. coli-based T7 promoter sequences. Our approach enabled both facile production of the alterochromides and in vivo interrogation of gene function associated with alterochromide's unusual brominated lipid side chain. This platform represents a simple but effective strategy for the discovery and biosynthetic characterization of natural products from marine proteobacteria.	1
Title: Optimization of pulsed-field gel electrophoresis for Legionella pneumophila subtyping Abstract: A total of 32 strains of Legionella pneumophila were used to optimize pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) for subtyping of L. pneumophila. Twenty-six isolates of L. pneumophila with various origins and 11 isolates from five different water systems were used as the panels. For optimization of electrophoretic parameters (EPs) of SfiI PFGE, 26 isolates were analyzed with SfiI digestion, using four EPs yielding the same D value. The EP of a switch time of 5 to 50 s for 21 h had the smallest similarity coefficients and was declared the optimal EP for SfiI PFGE of L. pneumophila. By software analysis and pilot study, AscI was chosen as another PFGE enzyme. AscI PFGE could cluster the isolates from each water system into the same or very similar patterns and had a high degree of typing concordance with other molecular methods. In evaluating the discriminatory power of AscI with the panel of 26 isolates, AscI PFGE gave one single pattern and a D value of 100%. AscI PFGE had a high discriminatory power and a high degree of consistency with epidemiological data and other molecular typing methods for L. pneumophila subtyping, and hence, AscI could be used as a restriction enzyme in PFGE subtyping of L. pneumophila.	0
Title: Identification and characterization of the biosynthetic gene cluster of divergolides from Streptomyces sp. W112 Abstract: Divergolides are a group of structurally unprecedented ansamacrolactam antibiotics with antibacterial and antitumor activities. A biosynthetic gene cluster predicted to encode the biosynthesis of divergolides was cloned and sequenced from endophytic Streptomyces sp. W112. The gene cluster of divergolides (div) spans a DNA region of 61-kb and consists of 20 open reading frames (ORFs) that encode polyketide synthases (PKSs), enzymes for the synthesis of AHBA and PKS extender units, and post-PKS modifications, proposed regulators, and putative transporters. Disruption of the AHBA synthase gene (divK) completely abolished the production of divergolides proved its involvement in the biosynthesis of divergolides. Bioinformatics analysis suggested that the regulatory gene div8 in div gene cluster might encode a positive regulator for the biosynthesis of divergolides. Constitutive overexpression of div8 improved the production of divergolides E, implying that div gene cluster maybe responsible for the biosynthesis of divergolides. These findings set the stage for fully investigating the biosynthesis of divergolides and rational engineering of new divergolide analogs by genetic modifications, and pave the way to further improve the production of divergolides.	1
Title: An unusual thioesterase promotes isochromanone ring formation in ajudazol biosynthesis Abstract: The ajudazols are antifungal secondary metabolites produced by a hybrid polyketide synthase (PKS)-nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) multienzyme "assembly line" in the myxobacterium Chondromyces crocatus Cm c5. The most striking structural feature of these compounds is an isochromanone ring system; such an aromatic moiety is only known from two other complex polyketides, the electron transport inhibitor stigmatellin and the polyether lasalocid. The cyclization and aromatization reactions in the stigmatellin pathway are presumed to be catalyzed by a cyclase domain located at the end of the PKS, while the origin of the lasalocid benzenoid ring remains obscure. Notably, the ajudazol biosynthetic machinery does not incorporate a terminal cyclase, but instead a variant thioesterase (TE) domain. Here we present detailed phylogenetic and sequence analysis, coupled with experiments both in vitro and in vivo, that suggest that this TE promotes formation of the isochromanone ring, a novel reaction for this type of domain. As the ajudazol TE has homologues in several other secondary-metabolite pathways, these results are likely to be generalizable.	1
Title: New technology and resources for cryptococcal research Abstract: Rapid advances in molecular biology and genome sequencing have enabled the generation of new technology and resources for cryptococcal research. RNAi-mediated specific gene knock down has become routine and more efficient by utilizing modified shRNA plasmids and convergent promoter RNAi constructs. This system was recently applied in a high-throughput screen to identify genes involved in host-pathogen interactions. Gene deletion efficiencies have also been improved by increasing rates of homologous recombination through a number of approaches, including a combination of double-joint PCR with split-marker transformation, the use of dominant selectable markers and the introduction of Cre-Loxp systems into Cryptococcus. Moreover, visualization of cryptococcal proteins has become more facile using fusions with codon-optimized fluorescent tags, such as green or red fluorescent proteins or, mCherry. Using recent genome-wide analytical tools, new transcriptional factors and regulatory proteins have been identified in novel virulence-related signaling pathways by employing microarray analysis, RNA-sequencing and proteomic analysis.	0
Title: Rescue of Pink1 Deficiency by Stress-Dependent Activation of Autophagy Abstract: Stimulating autophagy is a promising therapeutic strategy for slowing the progression of neurodegenerative disease. Neurons are insensitive to current approaches based on mTOR inhibition for activating autophagy, and instead may rely on the Parkinson's disease-associated proteins PINK1 and PARKIN to activate the autophagy-lysosomal pathway in response to mitochondrial damage. We developed a multifactorial zebrafish drug-screening platform combining Pink1 deficiency with an environmental toxin to compromise mitochondrial function and trigger dopaminergic neuron loss. Using a phenotypic screening strategy, we identified a series of piperazine phenothiazines, including trifluoperazine, which rescued Pink1 deficiency by activating autophagy selectively in stressed zebrafish and human cells. We show that trifluoperazine acts downstream of, or parallel to, PINK1/PARKIN to stimulate transcription factor EB nuclear translocation and the expression of autophagy-lysosomal target genes. These data suggest that stress-dependent pharmacological reactivation of autophagy could prevent the loss of vulnerable neurons to slow neurodegeneration.	0
Title: Identification of a novel aminopolycarboxylic acid siderophore gene cluster encoding the biosynthesis of ethylenediaminesuccinic acid hydroxyarginine (EDHA) Abstract: The mechanism of siderophore-mediated iron supply enhances fitness and survivability of microorganisms under iron limited growth conditions. One class of naturally occurring ionophores is the small aminopolycarboxylic acids (APCAs). Although they are structurally related to the most famous anthropogenic chelating agent, ethylenediaminetetraacetate (EDTA), they have been largely neglected by the scientific community. Here, we demonstrate the detection of APCA gene clusters by a computational screening of a nucleotide database. This genome mining approach enabled the discovery of a yet unknown APCA gene cluster in well-described actinobacterial strains, either known for their potential to produce valuable secondary metabolites (Streptomyces avermitilis) or for their pathogenic lifestyle (Streptomyces scabies, Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis, Corynebacterium ulcerans and Nocardia brasiliensis). The herein identified gene cluster was shown to encode the biosynthesis of APCA, ethylenediaminesuccinic acid hydroxyarginine (EDHA). Detailed and comparatively performed production and transcriptional profiling of EDHA and its biosynthesis genes showed strict iron-responsive biosynthesis.	1
Title: Gobichelin A and B: Mixed-Ligand Siderophores Discovered Using Proteomics Abstract: "Omic" strategies have been increasingly applied to natural product discovery processes, with (meta-)genome sequencing and mining implemented in many laboratories to date. Using the proteomics-based discovery platform called PrISM (Proteomic Investigation of Secondary Metabolism), we discovered two new siderophores gobichelin A and B from Streptomyces sp. NRRL F-4415, a strain without a sequenced genome. Using the proteomics information as a guide, the 37 kb gene cluster responsible for production of gobichelins was sequenced and its 20 open reading frames interpreted into a biosynthetic scheme. This led to the targeted detection and structure elucidation of the new compounds produced by nonribosomal peptide (NRP) synthesis.	1
Title: Engineering Haloferax mediterranei as an Efficient Platform for High Level Production of Lycopene Abstract: Lycopene attracts increasing interests in the pharmaceutical, food, and cosmetic industries due to its anti-oxidative and anti-cancer properties. Compared with other lycopene production methods, such as chemical synthesis or direct extraction from plants, the biosynthesis approach using microbes is more economical and sustainable. In this work, we engineered Haloferax mediterranei, a halophilic archaeon, as a new lycopene producer. H. mediterranei has the de novo synthetic pathway for lycopene but cannot accumulate this compound. To address this issue, we reinforced the lycopene synthesis pathway, blocked its flux to other carotenoids and disrupted its competitive pathways. The reaction from geranylgeranyl-PP to phytoene catalyzed by phytoene synthase (CrtB) was identified as the rate-limiting step in H. mediterranei. Insertion of a strong promoter PphaR immediately upstream of the crtB gene, or overexpression of the heterologous CrtB and phytoene desaturase (CrtI) led to a higher yield of lycopene. In addition, blocking bacterioruberin biosynthesis increased the purity and yield of lycopene. Knock-out of the key genes, responsible for poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate) (PHBV) biosynthesis, diverted more carbon flux into lycopene synthesis, and thus further enhanced lycopene production. The metabolic engineered H. mediterranei strain produced lycopene at 119.25 ± 0.55 mg per gram of dry cell weight in shake flask fermentation. The obtained yield was superior compared to the lycopene production observed in most of the engineered Escherichia coli or yeast even when they were cultivated in pilot scale bioreactors. Collectively, this work offers insights into the mechanism involved in carotenoid biosynthesis in haloarchaea and demonstrates the potential of using haloarchaea for the production of lycopene or other carotenoids.	0
Title: Transforming RNA-Seq data to improve the performance of prognostic gene signatures Abstract: Gene expression measurements have successfully been used for building prognostic signatures, i.e for identifying a short list of important genes that can predict patient outcome. Mostly microarray measurements have been considered, and there is little advice available for building multivariable risk prediction models from RNA-Seq data. We specifically consider penalized regression techniques, such as the lasso and componentwise boosting, which can simultaneously consider all measurements and provide both, multivariable regression models for prediction and automated variable selection. However, they might be affected by the typical skewness, mean-variance-dependency or extreme values of RNA-Seq covariates and therefore could benefit from transformations of the latter. In an analytical part, we highlight preferential selection of covariates with large variances, which is problematic due to the mean-variance dependency of RNA-Seq data. In a simulation study, we compare different transformations of RNA-Seq data for potentially improving detection of important genes. Specifically, we consider standardization, the log transformation, a variance-stabilizing transformation, the Box-Cox transformation, and rank-based transformations. In addition, the prediction performance for real data from patients with kidney cancer and acute myeloid leukemia is considered. We show that signature size, identification performance, and prediction performance critically depend on the choice of a suitable transformation. Rank-based transformations perform well in all scenarios and can even outperform complex variance-stabilizing approaches. Generally, the results illustrate that the distribution and potential transformations of RNA-Seq data need to be considered as a critical step when building risk prediction models by penalized regression techniques.	0
Title: Kinetic analysis of the 4-methylideneimidazole-5-one-containing tyrosine aminomutase in enediyne antitumor antibiotic C-1027 biosynthesis Abstract: The enediyne antitumor antibiotic C-1027 contains an unusual (S)-3-chloro-4,5-dihydroxy-beta-phenylalanine moiety, which requires an aminomutase for its biosynthesis. Previously, we established that SgcC4 is an aminomutase that catalyzes the conversion of L-tyrosine to (S)-beta-tyrosine and employs 4-methylideneimidazole-5-one (MIO) at its active site [Christenson, S. D., Liu, W., Toney, M. D., and Shen, B. (2003) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 125, 6062-6063]. Here, we present a thorough analysis of the properties of SgcC4. L-Tyrosine is the best substrate among those tested and most likely serves as the in vivo precursor for the (S)-3-chloro-4,5-dihydroxy-beta-phenylalanine moiety. The presence of MIO in the active site is supported by several lines of evidence. (1) Addition of ATP or divalent metal ions has no effect on its aminomutase activity. (2) SgcC4 has optimal activity at pH approximately 8.8, similar to the pH optima of MIO-dependent ammonia lyases. (3) SgcC4 is strongly inhibited by sodium borohydride and potassium cyanide, but preincubation with L-tyrosine or 4-hydroxycinnamate largely prevents this inhibition. (4) The difference spectrum between SgcC4 and its S153A mutant shows a positive peak at approximately 310 nm, indicative of MIO. (5) The S153A mutation lowers k(cat)/K(M) 640-fold. The SgcC4-catalyzed conversion of L-tyrosine to (S)-beta-tyrosine proceeds via 4-hydroxycinnamate as an intermediate. The latter also acts as a competitive inhibitor with respect to L-tyrosine and serves as an alternative substrate for the production of beta-tyrosine in the presence of an amino source. A full time course for the SgcC4-catalyzed interconversion between L-tyrosine, beta-tyrosine, and 4-hydroxycinnamate was measured and analyzed to provide estimates for the rate constants in a minimal mechanism. SgcC4 also exhibits a beta-tyrosine racemase activity, but alpha-tyrosine racemase activity was not detected.	1
Title: Unravelling the biosynthesis of pyriculol in the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae Abstract: Pyriculol was isolated from the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae and found to induce lesion formation on rice leaves. These findings suggest that it could be involved in virulence. The gene MoPKS19 was identified to encode a polyketide synthase essential for the production of the polyketide pyriculol in the rice blast fungus M. oryzae. The transcript abundance of MoPKS19 correlates with the biosynthesis rate of pyriculol in a time-dependent manner. Furthermore, gene inactivation of MoPKS19 resulted in a mutant unable to produce pyriculol, pyriculariol and their dihydro derivatives. Inactivation of a putative oxidase-encoding gene MoC19OXR1, which was found to be located in the genome close to MoPKS19, resulted in a mutant exclusively producing dihydropyriculol and dihydropyriculariol. By contrast, overexpression of MoC19OXR1 resulted in a mutant strain only producing pyriculol. The MoPKS19 cluster, furthermore, comprises two transcription factors MoC19TRF1 and MoC19TRF2, which were both found individually to act as negative regulators repressing gene expression of MoPKS19. Additionally, extracts of ΔMopks19 and ΔMoC19oxr1 made from axenic cultures failed to induce lesions on rice leaves compared to extracts of the wild-type strain. Consequently, pyriculol and its isomer pyriculariol appear to be the only lesion-inducing secondary metabolites produced by M. oryzae wild-type (MoWT) under these culture conditions. Interestingly, the mutants unable to produce pyriculol and pyriculariol were as pathogenic as MoWT, demonstrating that pyriculol is not required for infection.	1
Title: Isolation and characterization of the tobramycin biosynthetic gene cluster from Streptomyces tenebrarius Abstract: The biosynthetic gene cluster for tobramycin, a 2-deoxystreptamine-containing aminoglycoside antibiotic, was isolated from Streptomyces tenebrarius ATCC 17920. A genomic library of S. tenebrarius was constructed, and a cosmid, pST51, was isolated by the probes based on the core regions of 2-deoxy-scyllo-inosose (DOI) synthase, and L-glutamine:DOI aminotransferase and L-glutamine:scyllo-inosose aminotransferase. Sequencing of 33.9 kb revealed 24 open reading frames (ORFs) including putative tobramycin biosynthetic genes. We demonstrated that one of these ORFs, tbmA, encodes DOI synthase by in vitro enzyme assay of the purified protein. The catalytic residues of TbmA and dehydroquinate synthase were studied by homology modeling. The gene cluster found is likely to be involved in the biosynthesis of tobramycin.	1
Title: Effects of P-glycoprotein and its inhibitors on apoptosis in K562 cells Abstract: P-glycoprotein (P-gp) is a major factor in multidrug resistance (MDR) which is a serious obstacle in chemotherapy. P-gp has also been implicated in causing apoptosis of tumor cells, which was shown to be another important mechanism of MDR recently. To study the influence of P-gp in tumor cell apoptosis, K562/A cells (P-gp+) and K562/S cells (P-gp-) were subjected to doxorubicin (Dox), serum withdrawal, or independent co-incubation with multiple P-gp inhibitors, including valspodar (PSC833), verapamil (Ver) and H108 to induce apoptosis. Apoptosis was simultaneously detected by apoptotic rate, cell cycle by flow cytometry and cysteine aspartic acid-specific protease 3 (caspase 3) activity by immunoassay. Cytotoxicity and apoptosis induced by PSC833 were evaluated through an MTT method and apoptosis rate, and cell cycle combined with caspase 3 activity, respectively. The results show that K562/A cells are more resistant to apoptosis and cell cycle arrest than K562/S cells after treatment with Dox or serum deprivation. The apoptosis of K562/A cells increased after co-incubation with each of the inhibitors of P-gp. P-gp inhibitors also enhanced cell cycle arrest in K562/A cell. PSC833 most strikingly decreased viability and led to apoptosis and S phase arrest of cell cycle in K562/A cells. Our study demonstrates that P-gp inhibits the apoptosis of tumor cells in addition to participating in the efflux of intracellular chemotherapy drugs. The results of the caspase 3 activity assay also suggest that the role of P-gp in apoptosis avoidance is caspase-related.	0
Title: Discovery of Thanafactin A, a Linear, Proline-Containing Octalipopeptide from Pseudomonas sp. SH-C52, Motivated by Genome Mining Abstract: Genome mining of the bacterial strains Pseudomonas sp. SH-C52 and Pseudomonas fluorescens DSM 11579 showed that both strains contained a highly similar gene cluster encoding an octamodular nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) system which was not associated with a known secondary metabolite. Insertional mutagenesis of an NRPS component followed by comparative profiling led to the discovery of the corresponding novel linear octalipopeptide thanafactin A, which was subsequently isolated and its structure determined by two-dimensional NMR and further spectroscopic and chromatographic methods. In bioassays, thanafactin A exhibited weak protease inhibitory activity and was found to modulate swarming motility in a strain-specific manner.	1
Title: Cloning and nucleotide sequence of the gene encoding a serine proteinase inhibitor named marinostatin from a marine bacterium, Alteromonas sp. strain B-10-31 Abstract: The gene (mstI) encoding a serine proteinase inhibitor named marinostatin from marine Alteromonas sp. strain B-10-31 was cloned and its nucleotide sequence was analyzed. A short open reading frame of 192 bp encoded 63 amino acids with a molecular weight of 6,985. Furthermore, the initial product of marinostatin (marinostatin L) was purified and its amino acid sequence was analyzed. These results indicate that marinostatin is produced as a unique precursor consisting of the mature peptide and the leader peptide for an ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter, and furthermore the initial product of marinostatin is dehydrated and processed by proteolysis to give homologous forms of marinostatin.	1
Title: Mutacin II, a bactericidal antibiotic from Streptococcus mutans Abstract: Mutacin II is an antibiotic that is produced by group II Streptococcus mutans. It inhibits the growth of other streptococci as well as many other gram-positive microorganisms by a hitherto unknown mechanism. Mutacin II possess bactericidal activity against susceptible cells. It transiently depolarizes the transmembrane electrical potential (delta psi) and the transmembrane pH gradient (delta pH) and partially inhibits amino acid transport. However, it rapidly depletes the intracellular ATP pool in glucose-energized cells and prevents the generation of ATP. It is concluded that mutacin II does not belong to the group of pore-forming antibiotics (type A) or to the type B antibiotics, which inhibit phospholipases or interfere with peptidoglycan biosynthesis. Mutacin II acts by inhibiting essential enzyme functions at the level of metabolic energy generation, an activity that has not yet been classified for antibiotics.	1
Title: Biosynthesis of the enediyne antitumor antibiotic C-1027 involves a new branching point in chorismate metabolism Abstract: C-1027 is an enediyne antitumor antibiotic composed of four distinct moieties: an enediyne core, a deoxy aminosugar, a beta-amino acid, and a benzoxazolinate moiety. We now show that the benzoxazolinate moiety is derived from chorismate by the sequential action of two enzymes-SgcD, a 2-amino-2-deoxyisochorismate (ADIC) synthase and SgcG, an iron-sulfur, FMN-dependent ADIC dehydrogenase-to generate 3-enolpyruvoylanthranilate (OPA), a new intermediate in chorismate metabolism. The functional elucidation and catalytic properties of each enzyme are described, including spectroscopic characterization of the products and the development of a fluorescence-based assay for kinetic analysis. SgcD joins isochorismate (IC) synthase and 4-amino-4-deoxychorismate (ADC) synthase as anthranilate synthase component I (ASI) homologues that are devoid of pyruvate lyase activity inherent in ASI; yet, in contrast to IC and ADC synthase, SgcD has retained the ability to aminate chorismate identically to that observed for ASI. The net conversion of chorismate to OPA by the tandem action of SgcD and SgcG unambiguously establishes a new branching point in chorismate metabolism.	1
Title: Strong stimulation of recombinant protein production in Escherichia coli by combining stimulatory control elements in an expression cassette Abstract: Background:                       The XylS/Pm expression system has been used to produce recombinant proteins at industrial levels in Escherichia coli. Activation of transcription from the Pm promoter takes place in the presence of benzoic acid or derivatives of it. Previous mutagenesis studies resulted in identification of several variants of the expression control elements xylS (X), Pm (P) and the 5'-untranslated region (U) that individually gave rise to strongly stimulated expression. The goal of this study was to test if combination of such stimulatory mutations in the same expression vectors would lead to further increase of expression levels.                  Results:                       We combined X, P and U variants that were originally identified due to their ability to strongly stimulate expression of the reporter gene bla (resistance to penicillin). Combination of optimized elements stimulated bla expression up to 75-fold (X, P and U combined) relative to the wild-type system, while accumulated transcript levels increased about 50-fold. This is much more than for the elements individually. We also tested combination of the variant elements on two other and unrelated genes, celB (encoding phosphoglucomutase) and the human growth factor gene gm-csf. Protein production from these genes is much more efficient than from bla in the wild-type system, but expression was still significantly stimulated by the combination of X, P and U variants, although not to the same extent as for bla. We also integrated a single copy of the expression cassette with each gene into the E. coli chromosome and found that the expression level from this single copy was higher for bla than for the wild-type plasmid system, while it was lower for celB and gm-csf.                  Conclusion:                       Our results show that combination of stimulatory expression control elements can be used to further increase production of different proteins in E. coli. For one reporter gene (bla) this allowed for more protein production from a single gene copy integrated on the chromosome, compared to the wild-type plasmid system. The approach described here should in principle be applicable for improvement of any expression cassette.	0
Title: Modification of Lignins by Growing Cells of the Sulfate-Reducing Anaerobe Desulfovibrio desulfuricans Abstract: The anaerobic sulfate-reducing bacterium Desulfovibrio desulfuricans was grown on medium supplemented with either Kraft lignin or lignosulfonate. Only lignosulfonate contributed to the growth of D. desulfuricans cells, by replacing sulfate, a natural electron acceptor for this microorganism. Kraft lignin added to the culture medium could not substitute for lactate or sulfate, both necessary culture medium components. However, it was found to enhance the viability of D. desulfuricans cells. When changes occurring in lignin during growth of Desulfovibrio cultures were monitored, it was found that both lignin preparations could be partially depolymerized. Spectrophotometric and elemental analysis of biologically treated lignins suggested that both the polyphenolic backbone and lignin functional groups were affected by D. desulfuricans. After treatment, a twofold increase in the sulfur content of Kraft lignin and a minor decrease (14%) in the sulfur content of lignosulfonate were observed. After biological treatment, Kraft lignin and lignosulfonate both bound larger quantities of heavy metals.	0
Title: Lactoferrin is a natural inhibitor of plasminogen activation Abstract: The plasminogen system is essential for dissolution of fibrin clots, and in addition, it is involved in a wide variety of other physiological processes, including proteolytic activation of growth factors, cell migration, and removal of protein aggregates. On the other hand, uncontrolled plasminogen activation contributes to many pathological processes (e.g. tumor cells' invasion in cancer progression). Moreover, some virulent bacterial species (e.g. Streptococci or Borrelia) bind human plasminogen and hijack the host's plasminogen system to penetrate tissue barriers. Thus, the conversion of plasminogen to the active serine protease plasmin must be tightly regulated. Here, we show that human lactoferrin, an iron-binding milk glycoprotein, blocks plasminogen activation on the cell surface by direct binding to human plasminogen. We mapped the mutual binding sites to the N-terminal region of lactoferrin, encompassed also in the bioactive peptide lactoferricin, and kringle 5 of plasminogen. Finally, lactoferrin blocked tumor cell invasion in vitro and also plasminogen activation driven by Borrelia Our results explain many diverse biological properties of lactoferrin and also suggest that lactoferrin may be useful as a potential tool for therapeutic interventions to prevent both invasive malignant cells and virulent bacteria from penetrating host tissues.	0
Title: Comparative analysis of the biosynthetic gene clusters and pathways for three structurally related antitumor antibiotics: bleomycin, tallysomycin, and zorbamycin Abstract: The biosynthetic gene clusters for the glycopeptide antitumor antibiotics bleomycin (BLM), tallysomycin (TLM), and zorbamycin (ZBM) have been recently cloned and characterized from Streptomyces verticillus ATCC15003, Streptoalloteichus hindustanus E465-94 ATCC31158, and Streptomyces flavoviridis ATCC21892, respectively. The striking similarities and differences among the biosynthetic gene clusters for the three structurally related glycopeptide antitumor antibiotics prompted us to compare and contrast their respective biosynthetic pathways and to investigate various enzymatic elements. The presence of different numbers of isolated nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) domains in all three clusters does not result in major structural differences of the respective compounds. The seemingly identical domain organization of the NRPS modules responsible for heterocycle formation, on the other hand, is contrasted by the biosynthesis of two different structural entities, bithiazole and thiazolinyl-thiazole, for BLM/TLM and ZBM, respectively. Variations in sugar biosynthesis apparently dictate the glycosylation patterns distinct for each of the BLM, TLM, and ZBM glycopeptide scaffolds. These observations demonstrate nature's ingenuity and flexibility in achieving structural differences and similarities via various mechanisms and will surely inspire combinatorial biosynthesis efforts to expand on natural product structural diversity.	1
Title: CaMKII enhances voltage-gated sodium channel Nav1.6 activity and neuronal excitability Abstract: Nav1.6 is the primary voltage-gated sodium channel isoform expressed in mature axon initial segments and nodes, making it critical for initiation and propagation of neuronal impulses. Thus, Nav1.6 modulation and dysfunction may have profound effects on input-output properties of neurons in normal and pathological conditions. Phosphorylation is a powerful and reversible mechanism regulating ion channel function. Because Nav1.6 and the multifunctional Ca2+/CaM-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) are independently linked to excitability disorders, we sought to investigate modulation of Nav1.6 function by CaMKII signaling. We show that inhibition of CaMKII, a Ser/Thr protein kinase associated with excitability, synaptic plasticity, and excitability disorders, with the CaMKII-specific peptide inhibitor CN21 reduces transient and persistent currents in Nav1.6-expressing Purkinje neurons by 87%. Using whole-cell voltage clamp of Nav1.6, we show that CaMKII inhibition in ND7/23 and HEK293 cells significantly reduces transient and persistent currents by 72% and produces a 5.8-mV depolarizing shift in the voltage dependence of activation. Immobilized peptide arrays and nanoflow LC-electrospray ionization/MS of Nav1.6 reveal potential sites of CaMKII phosphorylation, specifically Ser-561 and Ser-641/Thr-642 within the first intracellular loop of the channel. Using site-directed mutagenesis to test multiple potential sites of phosphorylation, we show that Ala substitutions of Ser-561 and Ser-641/Thr-642 recapitulate the depolarizing shift in activation and reduction in current density. Computational simulations to model effects of CaMKII inhibition on Nav1.6 function demonstrate dramatic reductions in spontaneous and evoked action potentials in a Purkinje cell model, suggesting that CaMKII modulation of Nav1.6 may be a powerful mechanism to regulate neuronal excitability.	0
Title: β-Lactone formation during product release from a nonribosomal peptide synthetase Abstract: Nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) are multidomain modular biosynthetic assembly lines that polymerize amino acids into a myriad of biologically active nonribosomal peptides (NRPs). NRPS thioesterase (TE) domains employ diverse release strategies for off-loading thioester-tethered polymeric peptides from termination modules typically via hydrolysis, aminolysis, or cyclization to provide mature antibiotics as carboxylic acids/esters, amides, and lactams/lactones, respectively. Here we report the enzyme-catalyzed formation of a highly strained β-lactone ring during TE-mediated cyclization of a β-hydroxythioester to release the antibiotic obafluorin (Obi) from an NRPS assembly line. The Obi NRPS (ObiF) contains a type I TE domain with a rare catalytic cysteine residue that plays a direct role in β-lactone ring formation. We present a detailed genetic and biochemical characterization of the entire Obi biosynthetic gene cluster in plant-associated Pseudomonas fluorescens ATCC 39502 that establishes a general strategy for β-lactone biogenesis.	1
Title: Discovery and Characterization of Epemicins A and B, New 30-Membered Macrolides from Kutzneria sp. CA-103260 Abstract: Actinobacteria have been a rich source of novel, structurally complex natural products for many decades. Although the largest genus is Streptomyces, from which the majority of antibiotics in current and past clinical use were originally isolated, other less common genera also have the potential to produce a wealth of novel secondary metabolites. One example is the Kutzneria genus, which currently contains only five reported species. One of these species is Kutzneria albida DSM 43870T, which has 46 predicted biosynthetic gene clusters and is known to produce the macrolide antibiotic aculeximycin. Here, we report the isolation and structural characterization of two novel 30-membered glycosylated macrolides, epemicins A and B, that are structurally related to aculeximycin, from a rare Kutzneria sp. The absolute configuration for all chiral centers in the two compounds is proposed based on extensive 1D and 2D NMR studies and bioinformatics analysis of the gene cluster. Through heterologous expression and genetic inactivation, we have confirmed the link between the biosynthetic gene cluster and the new molecules. These findings show the potential of rare Actinobacteria to produce new, structurally diverse metabolites. Furthermore, the gene inactivation represents the first published report to genetically manipulate a representative of the Kutzneria genus.	1
Title: Trichloroethylene degradation by Escherichia coli containing the cloned Pseudomonas putida F1 toluene dioxygenase genes Abstract: Toluene dioxygenase from Pseudomonas putida F1 has been implicated as an enzyme capable of degrading trichloroethylene. This has now been confirmed with Escherichia coli JM109(pDTG601) that contains the structural genes (todC1C2BA) of toluene dioxygenase under the control of the tac promoter. The extent of trichloroethylene degradation by the recombinant organism depended on the cell concentration and the concentration of trichloroethylene. A linear rate of trichloroethylene degradation was observed with the E. coli recombinant strain. In contrast, P. putida F39/D, a mutant strain of P. putida F1 that does not contain cis-toluene dihydrodiol dehydrogenase, showed a much faster initial rate of trichloroethylene degradation which decreased over time.	0
Title: Two-photon fluorescent polysiloxane-based films with thermally responsive self switching properties achieved by a unique reversible spirocyclization mechanism Abstract: Responsiveness and reversibility are present in nature, and are ubiquitous in biological systems. The realization of reversibility and responsiveness is of great importance in the development of properties and the design of new materials. However, two-photon fluorescent thermal-responsive materials have not been reported to date. Herein, we engineered thermally responsive polysiloxane materials (Dns-non) that exhibited unique two-photon luminescence, and this is the first report about thermally responsive luminescent materials with two-photon fluorescence. The fluorescence of Dns-non could switch from the "on" to "off" state through a facile heating and cooling process, which could be observed by the naked eye. Monitoring the temperature of the CPU in situ was achieved by easily coating D1-non onto the CPU surface, which verified the potential application in devices of Dns-non. A unique alkaline tuned reversible transition mechanism of rhodamine-B from its spirocyclic to its ring-open state was proposed. Furthermore, Dns-non appeared to be a useful cell adhesive for the culture of cells on the surface. We believe that the constructed thermally responsive silicon films which have promising utilization as a new type of functional fluorescent material, may show broad applications in materials chemistry or bioscience.	0
Title: Thiopeptide biosynthesis featuring ribosomally synthesized precursor peptides and conserved posttranslational modifications Abstract: Thiopeptides, with potent activity against various drug-resistant pathogens, contain a characteristic macrocyclic core consisting of multiple thiazoles, dehydroamino acids, and a 6-membered nitrogen heterocycle. Their biosynthetic pathways remain elusive, in spite of great efforts by in vivo feeding experiments. Here, cloning, sequencing, and characterization of the thiostrepton and siomycin A gene clusters unveiled a biosynthetic paradigm for the thiopeptide specific core formation, featuring ribosomally synthesized precursor peptides and conserved posttranslational modifications. The paradigm generality for thiopeptide biosynthesis was supported by genome mining and ultimate confirmation of the thiocillin I production in Bacillus cereus ATCC 14579, a strain that was previously unknown as a thiopeptide producer. These findings set the stage to accelerate the discovery of thiopeptides by prediction at the genetic level and to generate structural diversity by applying combinatorial biosynthesis methods.	1
Title: Conformational flexibility and peptide interaction of the translocation ATPase SecA Abstract: The SecA ATPase forms a functional complex with the protein-conducting SecY channel to translocate polypeptides across the bacterial cell membrane. SecA recognizes the translocation substrate and catalyzes its unidirectional movement through the SecY channel. The recent crystal structure of the Thermotoga maritima SecA-SecYEG complex shows the ATPase in a conformation where the nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs) have closed around a bound ADP-BeFx complex and SecA's polypeptide-binding clamp is shut. Here, we present the crystal structure of T. maritima SecA in isolation, determined in its ADP-bound form at 3.1 A resolution. SecA alone has a drastically different conformation in which the nucleotide-binding pocket between NBD1 and NBD2 is open and the preprotein cross-linking domain has rotated away from both NBDs, thereby opening the polypeptide-binding clamp. To investigate how this clamp binds polypeptide substrates, we also determined a structure of Bacillus subtilis SecA in complex with a peptide at 2.5 A resolution. This structure shows that the peptide augments the highly conserved beta-sheet at the back of the clamp. Taken together, these structures suggest a mechanism by which ATP hydrolysis can lead to polypeptide translocation.	0
Title: Development of an alkaloid-pyrone annulation: synthesis of pleiomaltinine Abstract: Odd Couple:                       Methodology for the synthesis of alkaloid-pyrones using a novel pyrone annulation of β–carbolines and indoles with 3-siloxy-4-pyrones is reported. The approach has enabled semisynthesis of the unprecedented alkaloid-pyrone pleiomaltinine from the plant-derived indole-alkaloid pleiocarpamine.	0
Title: Ruminococcus gnavus, a member of the human gut microbiome associated with Crohn's disease, produces an inflammatory polysaccharide Abstract: A substantial and increasing number of human diseases are associated with changes in the gut microbiota, and discovering the molecules and mechanisms underlying these associations represents a major research goal. Multiple studies associate Ruminococcus gnavus, a prevalent gut microbe, with Crohn's disease, a major type of inflammatory bowel disease. We have found that R. gnavus synthesizes and secretes a complex glucorhamnan polysaccharide with a rhamnose backbone and glucose sidechains. Chemical and spectroscopic studies indicated that the glucorhamnan was largely a repeating unit of five sugars with a linear backbone formed from three rhamnose units and a short sidechain composed of two glucose units. The rhamnose backbone is made from 1,2- and 1,3-linked rhamnose units, and the sidechain has a terminal glucose linked to a 1,6-glucose. This glucorhamnan potently induces inflammatory cytokine (TNFα) secretion by dendritic cells, and TNFα secretion is dependent on toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). We also identify a putative biosynthetic gene cluster for this molecule, which has the four biosynthetic genes needed to convert glucose to rhamnose and the five glycosyl transferases needed to build the repeating pentasaccharide unit of the inflammatory glucorhamnan.	1
Title: Halorhabdus tiamatea: proteogenomics and glycosidase activity measurements identify the first cultivated euryarchaeon from a deep-sea anoxic brine lake as potential polysaccharide degrader Abstract: Euryarchaea from the genus Halorhabdus have been found in hypersaline habitats worldwide, yet are represented by only two isolates: Halorhabdus utahensis AX-2(T) from the shallow Great Salt Lake of Utah, and Halorhabdus tiamatea SARL4B(T) from the Shaban deep-sea hypersaline anoxic lake (DHAL) in the Red Sea. We sequenced the H. tiamatea genome to elucidate its niche adaptations. Among sequenced archaea, H. tiamatea features the highest number of glycoside hydrolases, the majority of which were expressed in proteome experiments. Annotations and glycosidase activity measurements suggested an adaptation towards recalcitrant algal and plant-derived hemicelluloses. Glycosidase activities were higher at 2% than at 0% or 5% oxygen, supporting a preference for low-oxygen conditions. Likewise, proteomics indicated quinone-mediated electron transport at 2% oxygen, but a notable stress response at 5% oxygen. Halorhabdus tiamatea furthermore encodes proteins characteristic for thermophiles and light-dependent enzymes (e.g. bacteriorhodopsin), suggesting that H. tiamatea evolution was mostly not governed by a cold, dark, anoxic deep-sea habitat. Using enrichment and metagenomics, we could demonstrate presence of similar glycoside hydrolase-rich Halorhabdus members in the Mediterranean DHAL Medee, which supports that Halorhabdus species can occupy a distinct niche as polysaccharide degraders in hypersaline environments.	0
Title: N-acylsulfonamide assisted tandem C-H olefination/annulation: synthesis of isoindolinones Abstract: A tandem C-H olefination/annulation sequence directed by N-acylsulfonamides affords a variety of isoindolinones. This transformation is compatible with aliphatic alkenes as well as conjugated alkenes. Notably, molecular oxygen can be used as the sole, eco-friendly oxidant.	0
Title: Prototype of an intertwined secondary-metabolite supercluster Abstract: The hallmark trait of fungal secondary-metabolite gene clusters is well established, consisting of contiguous enzymatic and often regulatory gene(s) devoted to the production of a metabolite of a specific chemical class. Unexpectedly, we have found a deviation from this motif in a subtelomeric region of Aspergillus fumigatus. This region, under the control of the master regulator of secondary metabolism, LaeA, contains, in its entirety, the genetic machinery for three natural products (fumitremorgin, fumagillin, and pseurotin), where genes for fumagillin and pseurotin are physically intertwined in a single supercluster. Deletions of 29 adjoining genes revealed that fumagillin and pseurotin are coregulated by the supercluster-embedded regulatory gene with biosynthetic genes belonging to one of the two metabolic pathways in a noncontiguous manner. Comparative genomics indicates the fumagillin/pseurotin supercluster is maintained in a rapidly evolving region of diverse fungal genomes. This blended design confounds predictions from established secondary-metabolite cluster search algorithms and provides an expanded view of natural product evolution.	1
Title: Elucidation of pseurotin biosynthetic pathway points to trans-acting C-methyltransferase: generation of chemical diversity Abstract: Pseurotins comprise a family of structurally related Aspergillal natural products having interesting bioactivity. However, little is known about the biosynthetic steps involved in the formation of their complex chemical features. Systematic deletion of the pseurotin biosynthetic genes in A. fumigatus and in vivo and in vitro characterization of the tailoring enzymes to determine the biosynthetic intermediates, and the gene products responsible for the formation of each intermediate, are described. Thus, the main biosynthetic steps leading to the formation of pseurotin A from the predominant precursor, azaspirene, were elucidated. The study revealed the combinatorial nature of the biosynthesis of the pseurotin family of compounds and the intermediates. Most interestingly, we report the first identification of an epoxidase C-methyltransferase bifunctional fusion protein PsoF which appears to methylate the nascent polyketide backbone carbon atom in trans.	1
Title: Identification of a flavin:NADH oxidoreductase involved in the biosynthesis of actinorhodin. Purification and characterization of the recombinant enzyme Abstract: The biosynthesis of the polyketide antibiotic actinorhodin by Streptomyces coelicolor involves the oxidative dimerization and hydroxylation of a precursor, most likely dihydrokalafungin, as the final steps in its formation. Mutations in the actVB gene block these last steps, and the mutants secrete kalafungin as a shunt product. To investigate the role of the actVB gene in these transformation, we have overexpressed the gene in Escherichia coli and purified and characterized the recombinant protein. ActVB was shown to catalyze the reduction of FMN by NADH to give NAD and FMNH2, which, unusually, is released into solution. The protein contains no chromogenic cofactors and exhibits no requirements for added metal ions. The reaction obeys simple kinetics and proceeds through the formation of a ternary complex; Km values for FMN and NADH are 1.5 and 7.3 microM, respectively, and kcat is about 5 s-1. FAD and riboflavin are also substrates for the enzyme, although they have much higher Km values. The subunit structure of the enzyme was investigated by analytical ultracentrifugation, which showed the protein to exist in rapid equilibrium between monomer and dimer forms. The possible role of this oxidoreductase in the oxidative chemistry of actinorhodin biosynthesis is discussed.	1
Title: Structure-Based Identification of a Potent Inhibitor Targeting Stp1-Mediated Virulence Regulation in Staphylococcus aureus Abstract: The increasing threats of antibiotic resistance urge the need for developing new strategies against bacterial infections. Targeting eukaryotic-like Ser/Thr phosphatase Stp1-mediated virulence regulation represents a promising approach for combating staphylococcal infection yet to be explored. Here, we report the 2.32-Å resolution crystal structure of Stp1. Stp1 binds an unexpected fourth metal ion, which is important for Stp1's enzymatic activity as demonstrated by amino acid substitution studies. Inspired by the structural details of Stp1, we identified a potent and selective Stp1 inhibitor, aurintricarboxylic acid (ATA). Transcriptome analysis and biochemical studies supported Stp1 as the target of ATA inhibition within the pathogen, preventing upregulation of virulence genes. Notably, ATA did not affect in vitro growth of Staphylococcus aureus, while simultaneously attenuating staphylococcal virulence in mice. Our findings demonstrate that ATA is a potent anti-virulence compound against staphylococcal infection, laying the foundation for further developing new scaffolds for Stp1-targeted small molecules.	0
Title: RAN proteins and RNA foci from antisense transcripts in C9ORF72 ALS and frontotemporal dementia Abstract: The finding that a GGGGCC (G4C2) hexanucleotide repeat expansion in the chromosome 9 ORF 72 (C9ORF72) gene is a common cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) links ALS/FTD to a large group of unstable microsatellite diseases. Previously, we showed that microsatellite expansion mutations can be bidirectionally transcribed and that these mutations express unexpected proteins by a unique mechanism, repeat-associated non-ATG (RAN) translation. In this study, we show that C9ORF72 antisense transcripts are elevated in the brains of C9ORF72 expansion-positive [C9(+)] patients, and antisense GGCCCC (G2C4) repeat-expansion RNAs accumulate in nuclear foci in brain. Additionally, sense and antisense foci accumulate in blood and are potential biomarkers of the disease. Furthermore, we show that RAN translation occurs from both sense and antisense expansion transcripts, resulting in the expression of six RAN proteins (antisense: Pro-Arg, Pro-Ala, Gly-Pro; and sense: Gly-Ala, Gly-Arg, Gly-Pro). These proteins accumulate in cytoplasmic aggregates in affected brain regions, including the frontal and motor cortex, hippocampus, and spinal cord neurons, with some brain regions showing dramatic RAN protein accumulation and clustering. The finding that unique antisense G2C4 RNA foci and three unique antisense RAN proteins accumulate in patient tissues indicates that bidirectional transcription of expanded alleles is a fundamental pathologic feature of C9ORF72 ALS/FTD. Additionally, these findings suggest the need to test therapeutic strategies that target both sense and antisense RNAs and RAN proteins in C9ORF72 ALS/FTD, and to more broadly consider the role of antisense expression and RAN translation across microsatellite expansion diseases.	0
Title: Function-related replacement of bacterial siderophore pathways Abstract: Bacterial genomes are rife with orphan biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) associated with secondary metabolism of unrealized natural product molecules. Often up to a tenth of the genome is predicted to code for the biosynthesis of diverse metabolites with mostly unknown structures and functions. This phenomenal diversity of BGCs coupled with their high rates of horizontal transfer raise questions about whether they are really active and beneficial, whether they are neutral and confer no advantage, or whether they are carried in genomes because they are parasitic or addictive. We previously reported that Salinispora bacteria broadly use the desferrioxamine family of siderophores for iron acquisition. Herein we describe a new and unrelated group of peptidic siderophores called salinichelins from a restricted number of Salinispora strains in which the desferrioxamine biosynthesis genes have been lost. We have reconstructed the evolutionary history of these two different siderophore families and show that the acquisition and retention of the new salinichelin siderophores co-occurs with the loss of the more ancient desferrioxamine pathway. This identical event occurred at least three times independently during the evolution of the genus. We surmise that certain BGCs may be extraneous because of their functional redundancy and demonstrate that the relative evolutionary pace of natural pathway replacement shows high selective pressure against retention of functionally superfluous gene clusters.	1
Title: Dynamic Continuum of Molecular Assemblies for Controlling Cell Fates Abstract: Biological systems have evolved to create a structural and dynamic continuum of bio-macromolecular assemblies for the purpose of optimizing the system's functions. The formation of these dynamic higher-order assemblies is precisely controlled by biological cues. However, controlling the self-assembly of synthetic molecules spatiotemporally in or on live cells is still a big challenge, especially for performing functions. This concept article introduces the use of in situ reactions as a spatiotemporal control to form assemblies of small molecules that induce cell morphogenesis or apoptosis. After briefly introducing a representative example of a natural dynamic continuum of the higher-order assemblies, we describe enzyme-instructed self-assembly (EISA) for constructing dynamic assemblies of small molecules, then discuss the use of EISA for controlling cell morphogenesis and apoptosis. Finally, we provide a brief outlook to discuss the future perspective of this exciting new research direction.	0
Title: Organization of the biosynthetic gene cluster for the macrolide antibiotic spiramycin in Streptomyces ambofaciens Abstract: Spiramycin, a 16-membered macrolide antibiotic used in human medicine, is produced by Streptomyces ambofaciens; it comprises a polyketide lactone, platenolide, to which three deoxyhexose sugars are attached. In order to characterize the gene cluster governing the biosynthesis of spiramycin, several overlapping cosmids were isolated from an S. ambofaciens gene library, by hybridization with various probes (spiramycin resistance or biosynthetic genes, tylosin biosynthetic genes), and the sequences of their inserts were determined. Sequence analysis showed that the spiramycin biosynthetic gene cluster spanned a region of over 85 kb of contiguous DNA. In addition to the five previously described genes that encode the type I polyketide synthase involved in platenolide biosynthesis, 45 other genes have been identified. It was possible to propose a function for most of the inferred proteins in spiramycin biosynthesis, in its regulation, in resistance to the produced antibiotic or in the provision of extender units for the polyketide synthase. Two of these genes, predicted to be involved in deoxysugar biosynthesis, were inactivated by gene replacement, and the resulting mutants were unable to produce spiramycin, thus confirming their involvement in spiramycin biosynthesis. This work reveals the main features of spiramycin biosynthesis and constitutes a first step towards a detailed molecular analysis of the production of this medically important antibiotic.	1
Title: Different antibiotic resistance and sporulation properties within multiclonal Clostridium difficile PCR ribotypes 078, 126, and 033 in a single calf farm Abstract: Clostridium difficile strains were sampled periodically from 50 animals at a single veal calf farm over a period of 6 months. At arrival, 10% of animals were C. difficile positive, and the peak incidence was determined to occur at the age of 18 days (16%). The prevalence then decreased, and at slaughter, C. difficile could not be isolated. Six different PCR ribotypes were detected, and strains within a single PCR ribotype could be differentiated further by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). The PCR ribotype diversity was high up to the animal age of 18 days, but at later sampling points, PCR ribotype 078 and the highly related PCR ribotype 126 predominated. Resistance to tetracycline, doxycycline, and erythromycin was detected, while all strains were susceptible to amoxicillin and metronidazole. Multiple variations of the resistance gene tet(M) were present at the same sampling point, and these changed over time. We have shown that PCR ribotypes often associated with cattle (ribotypes 078, 126, and 033) were not clonal but differed in PFGE type, sporulation properties, antibiotic sensitivities, and tetracycline resistance determinants, suggesting that multiple strains of the same PCR ribotype infected the calves and that calves were likely to be infected prior to arrival at the farm. Importantly, strains isolated at later time points were more likely to be resistant to tetracycline and erythromycin and showed higher early sporulation efficiencies in vitro, suggesting that these two properties converge to promote the persistence of C. difficile in the environment or in hosts.	0
Title: Identification and Characterization of the Sulfazecin Monobactam Biosynthetic Gene Cluster Abstract: The monobactams, exemplified by the natural product sulfazecin, are the only class of β-lactam antibiotics not inactivated by metallo-β-lactamases, which confer bacteria with extended-spectrum β-lactam resistance. We screened a transposon mutagenesis library from Pseudomonas acidophila ATCC 31363 and isolated a sulfazecin-deficient mutant that revealed a gene cluster encoding two non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs), a methyltransferase, a sulfotransferase, and a dioxygenase. Three modules and an aberrant C-terminal thioesterase (TE) domain are distributed across the two NRPSs. Biochemical examination of the adenylation (A) domains provided evidence that L-2,3-diaminopropionate, not L-serine as previously thought, is the direct source of the β-lactam ring of sulfazecin. ATP/PPi exchange assay also revealed an unusual substrate selectivity shift of one A domain when expressed with or without the immediately upstream condensation domain. Gene inactivation analysis defined a cluster of 13 open reading frames sufficient for sulfazecin production, precursor synthesis, self-resistance, and regulation. The identification of a key intermediate supported a proposed NRPS-mediated mechanism of sulfazecin biosynthesis and β-lactam ring formation distinct from the nocardicins, another NRPS-derived subclass of monocyclic β-lactam. These findings will serve as the basis for further biosynthetic research and potential engineering of these important antibiotics.	1
Title: Novel approaches for efficient in vivo fermentation production of noncoding RNAs Abstract: Genome-derived noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs), including microRNAs (miRNAs), small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), and long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), play an essential role in the control of target gene expression underlying various cellular processes, and dysregulation of ncRNAs is involved in the pathogenesis and progression of various diseases in virtually all species including humans. Understanding ncRNA biology has opened new avenues to develop novel RNA-based therapeutics. Presently, ncRNA research and drug development is dominated by the use of ncRNA mimics that are synthesized chemically in vitro and supplemented with extensive and various types of artificial modifications and thus may not necessarily recapitulate the properties of natural RNAs generated and folded in living cells in vivo. Therefore, there are growing interests in developing novel technologies for in vivo production of RNA molecules. The two most recent major breakthroughs in achieving an efficient, large-scale, and cost-effective fermentation production of recombinant or bioengineered RNAs (e.g., tens of milligrams from 1 L of bacterial culture) are (1) using stable RNA carriers and (2) direct overexpression in RNase III-deficient bacteria, while other approaches offer a low yield (e.g., nano- to microgram scales per liter). In this article, we highlight these novel microbial fermentation-based technologies that have shifted the paradigm to the production of true biological ncRNA molecules for research and development.	0
Title: Investigating the Function of Cryptic Cytochalasan Cytochrome P450 Monooxygenases Using Combinatorial Biosynthesis Abstract: Tailoring enzymes in cytochalasan biosynthesis are relatively promiscuous. Exploiting this property, we deduced the function of four cryptic cytochrome P450 monooxygenases via heterologous expression of six cytochrome P450-encoding genes, originating from Hypoxylon fragiforme and Pyricularia oryzae, in pyrichalasin H ΔP450 strains. Three cryptic cytochrome P450 enzymes (HffD, HffG, and CYP1) restored pyrichalasin H production in mutant strains, while CYP3 catalyzed a site-selective epoxidation leading to the isolation of three novel cytochalasans.	1
Title: Differentiation of Bacillus anthracis, B. cereus, and B. thuringiensis by using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis Abstract: A pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) method was developed for discriminating Bacillus anthracis from B. cereus and B. thuringiensis. A worldwide collection of 25 B. anthracis isolates showed high-profile homology, and these isolates were unambiguously distinguished from B. cereus and B. thuringiensis isolates by cluster analysis of the whole-genome macrorestriction enzyme digestion patterns generated by NotI.	0
Title: Fluorous synthesis of hydantoins and thiohydantoins Abstract: [reaction: see text] A fluorous synthesis of hydantoins is introduced. The reaction of perfluoroalkyl (Rfh)-tagged amino esters with an isocyanate is followed by the cyclization of ureas and simultaneous cleavage of the fluorous tag to afford hydantoins. The product purification is performed by solid-phase extraction over FluoroFlash cartridges, and no fluorous solvent is involved in either the reaction or the separation processes. The same method applies to synthesis of thiohydantoins.	0
Title: Chemical mechanisms involved during the biosynthesis of tropolones Abstract: Tropolones are seven-membered aromatic rings which feature in the core of several important bioactive natural products including colchicine and stipitatic acid. Studies of their biosynthesis over nearly 70 years have revealed four parallel routes from polyketide, terpene, alkaloid and shikimate precursors, but the key steps all involve ring expansion of an alkylated 6-membered ring. Recent studies in fungi have revealed details of the individual chemical steps at the molecular level, but detailed molecular biosynthetic pathways in other organisms remain obscure.	1
Title: Characterization of Streptomyces nogalater genes encoding enzymes involved in glycosylation steps in nogalamycin biosynthesis Abstract: The sno gene cluster in Streptomyces nogalater ATCC 27451 contains the nogalamycin biosynthesis genes. A set of plasmid constructions carrying fragments of the sno cluster that lie downstream of snoD were used to complement the S. galilaeus mutant H039, which is blocked in rhodosamine and 2-deoxyfucose biosynthesis in the aclacinomycin pathway. Sequence analysis of this cluster revealed three contiguous open reading frames (ORFs) that were designated snoF, snoG, and snoH. Only those plasmid constructs that expressed SnoG were able to complement H039. SnoG shows similarity to GalE, a UDP-glucose-4-epimerase catalyzing the epimerization of UDP-glucose to UDP-galactose. The putative SnoF protein is similar to 3,5-epimerases involved in rhamnose biosynthesis. The deduced product of snoH is a 489-amino acid polypeptide. It is similar to the product of dau ORF3 found in the daunomycin cluster. However its function is still unclear. Based on the complementation experiments and sequence analysis, this part of the sno cluster is suggested to be involved in the biosynthesis of the sugar portion of nogalamycin. Interestingly, SnoA, a transcriptional activator for the sno minimal polyketide synthase, is also needed to express this cluster.	1
Title: Structural Revision and Biosynthesis of the Fungal Phytotoxins Phyllostictines A and B Abstract: The structure of the fungal phytotoxins known as the phyllostictines has been revised to a series of bicyclic 3-methylene tetramic acids. Genome sequencing of the producing organism Phyllostica cirsii has revealed a biosynthetic gene cluster responsible for the biosynthesis of the phyllostictines, and targeted knockout experiments have proven the link and produced an intermediate.	1
Title: Biosynthesis of the ergot alkaloids Abstract: The ergots are a structurally diverse group of alkaloids derived from tryptophan and dimethylallyl pyrophosphate (DMAPP) . The potent bioactivity of ergot alkaloids have resulted in their use in many applications throughout human history. In this highlight, we recap some of the history of the ergot alkaloids, along with a brief description of the classifications of the different ergot structures and producing organisms. Finally we describe what the advancements that have been made in understanding the biosynthetic pathways, both at the genomic and the biochemical levels. We note that several excellent review on the ergot alkaloids, including one by Wallwey and Li in Nat. Prod. Rep., have been published recently. We provide a brief overview of the ergot alkaloids, and highlight the advances in biosynthetic pathway elucidation that have been made since 2011 in Section 4.	1
Title: Protective effect of pinitol against D-galactosamine-induced hepatotoxicity in rats fed on a high-fat diet Abstract: The protective effect of pinitol against D-galactosamine (GalN)-induced liver damage was examined. Forty male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into normal control, GalN control, and pinitol groups (0.5%, 1%, and 2%). After 8 weeks of feeding, a single dose of GalN (650 mg/kg) was administered 24 h before their sacrifice. The serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) levels were significantly increased after an injection with GalN (P<0.05), but pinitol supplementation at the level of 0.5% reversed these changes to normal levels. Significant decreases in serum triglyceride and cholesterol and increases in hepatic cholesterol were observed in GalN-intoxicated rats. However, supplementation with pinitol significantly attenuated these trends. In addition, pinitol elevated the Mn-superoxide dismutase, glutathione reductase, and catalase activities, prevented hepatic lipid peroxidation, and restored the hepatic GSH levels and cytochrome P450 2E1 function. Thus, 0.5% pinitol supplementation protected the rats from the hepatotoxicity induced by GalN, at least part of its effect being attributable to attenuation of the oxidative stress and inflammatory process promoted by GalN.	0
Title: Identification of pharmacological chaperones for Gaucher disease and characterization of their effects on beta-glucocerebrosidase by hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry Abstract: Point mutations in beta-glucocerebrosidase (GCase) can result in a deficiency of both GCase activity and protein in lysosomes thereby causing Gaucher Disease (GD). Enzyme inhibitors such as isofagomine, acting as pharmacological chaperones (PCs), increase these levels by binding and stabilizing the native form of the enzyme in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and allow increased lysosomal transport of the enzyme. A high-throughput screen of the 50,000-compound Maybridge library identified two, non-carbohydrate-based inhibitory molecules, a 2,4-diamino-5-substituted quinazoline (IC(50) 5 microM) and a 5-substituted pyridinyl-2-furamide (IC(50) 8 microM). They raised the levels of functional GCase 1.5-2.5-fold in N370S or F213I GD fibroblasts. Immunofluorescence confirmed that treated GD fibroblasts had decreased levels of GCase in their ER and increased levels in lysosomes. Changes in protein dynamics, monitored by hydrogen/deuterium-exchange mass spectrometry, identified a domain III active-site loop (residues 243-249) as being significantly stabilized upon binding of isofagomine or either of these two new compounds; this suggests a common mechanism for PC enhancement of intracellular transport.	0
Title: Resistance imparted by traditional Chinese medicines to the acute change of glutamic pyruvic transaminase, alkaline phosphatase and creatine kinase activities in rat blood caused by noise Abstract: The activities of serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (GPT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and creatine kinase (CK) in rats injected or not with the Chinese medicines, Astragali, Rhodiolae and Ligusticum, were determined after noise exposure. Noise at 95 and 105 dB significantly increased the activities of GPT, ALP and CK, and showed a dependence on the exposure time. The injection of each medicine significantly suppressed the increased enzyme activities by 95 and 105 dB noise.	0
Title: Functional characterization of the cyclomarin/cyclomarazine prenyltransferase CymD directs the biosynthesis of unnatural cyclic peptides Abstract: In vitro and in vivo characterization of the cyclomarin/cyclomarazine prenyltransferase CymD revealed its ability to prenylate tryptophan prior to incorporation into both cyclic peptides by the nonribosomal peptide synthetase CymA. This knowledge was utilized to bioengineer novel derivatives of these marine bacterial natural products by providing synthetic N-alkyl tryptophans to a prenyltransferase-deficient mutant of Salinispora arenicola CNS-205.	1
Title: Reconstitution of Low-Density Lipoproteins with Fatty Acids for the Targeted Delivery of Drugs into Cancer Cells Abstract: Low-density lipoproteins (LDLs) are a class of nanocarriers for the targeted delivery of therapeutics into aberrant cells that overexpress the LDL receptor. A facile procedure is used for reconstituting the hydrophobic core of LDLs with a binary fatty acid mixture. Facilitated by the tumor targeting capability of the apolipoprotein, the reconstituted, drug-loaded LDLs can effectively target cancer cells that overexpress the LDL receptor while showing minor adverse impact on normal fibroblasts. According to a hypothesized mechanism, the reconstituted LDLs can also enable metabolism-triggered drug release while preventing the payloads from lysosomal degradation. This study demonstrates that LDLs reconstructed with fatty acids hold great promise to serve as effective and versatile nanocarriers for targeted cancer therapy.	0
Title: Anatoxin-a synthetase gene cluster of the cyanobacterium Anabaena sp. strain 37 and molecular methods to detect potential producers Abstract: Cyanobacterial mass occurrences are common in fresh and brackish waters. They pose a threat to water users due to toxins frequently produced by the cyanobacterial species present. Anatoxin-a and homoanatoxin-a are neurotoxins synthesized by various cyanobacteria, e.g., Anabaena, Oscillatoria, and Aphanizomenon. The biosynthesis of these toxins and the genes involved in anatoxin production were recently described for Oscillatoria sp. strain PCC 6506 (A. Méjean et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 131:7512-7513, 2009). In this study, we identified the anatoxin synthetase gene cluster (anaA to anaG and orf1; 29 kb) in Anabaena sp. strain 37. The gene (81.6% to 89.2%) and amino acid (78.8% to 86.9%) sequences were highly similar to those of Oscillatoria sp. PCC 6506, while the organization of the genes differed. Molecular detection methods for potential anatoxin-a and homoanatoxin-a producers of the genera Anabaena, Aphanizomenon, and Oscillatoria were developed by designing primers to recognize the anaC gene. Anabaena and Oscillatoria anaC genes were specifically identified in several cyanobacterial strains by PCR. Restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis of the anaC amplicons enabled simultaneous identification of three producer genera: Anabaena, Oscillatoria, and Aphanizomenon. The molecular methods developed in this study revealed the presence of both Anabaena and Oscillatoria as potential anatoxin producers in Finnish fresh waters and the Baltic Sea; they could be applied for surveys of these neurotoxin producers in other aquatic environments.	1
Title: Biosynthesis of the putative siderophore erythrochelin requires unprecedented crosstalk between separate nonribosomal peptide gene clusters Abstract: The genome of the erythromycin-producing bacterium Saccharopolyspora erythraea contains many orphan secondary metabolite gene clusters including two (nrps3 and nrps5) predicted to govern biosynthesis of nonribosomal peptide-based siderophores. We report here the production by S. erythraea, even under iron-sufficient conditions, of a 2,5-diketopiperazine siderophore candidate we have named erythrochelin. Deletion of the nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) gene ercD within the nrps5 cluster abolished erythrochelin production. The tetrapeptide backbone of erythrochelin (alpha-N-acetyl-delta-N-acetyl-delta-N-hydroxyornithine-serine-delta-N-hydroxyornithine-delta-N-acetyl-delta-N-hydroxyornithine) suggests an orthodox colinear model for erythrochelin assembly. Curiously, the delta-N-acetyltransferase required for erythrochelin biosynthesis is encoded within a remote NRPS-cluster (nrps1) whose own NRPS contains an inactivating mutation. Disruption of the nrps1 gene mcd abolished erythrochelin biosynthesis, which could then be restored by addition of synthetic L-delta-N-acetyl-delta-N-hydroxyornithine, confirming an unprecedented example of functional crosstalk between nrps clusters.	1
Title: Redox-Active Reagents for Photocatalytic Generation of the OCF3 Radical and (Hetero)Aryl C-H Trifluoromethoxylation Abstract: The trifluoromethoxy (OCF3 ) radical is of great importance in organic chemistry. Yet, the catalytic and selective generation of this radical at room temperature and pressure remains a longstanding challenge. Herein, the design and development of a redox-active cationic reagent (1) that enables the formation of the OCF3 radical in a controllable, selective, and catalytic fashion under visible-light photocatalytic conditions is reported. More importantly, the reagent allows catalytic, intermolecular C-H trifluoromethoxylation of a broad array of (hetero)arenes and biorelevant compounds. Experimental and computational studies suggest single electron transfer (SET) from excited photoredox catalysts to 1 resulting in exclusive liberation of the OCF3 radical. Addition of this radical to (hetero)arenes gives trifluoromethoxylated cyclohexadienyl radicals that are oxidized and deprotonated to afford the products of trifluoromethoxylation.	0
Title: Recombinant Protein Stability in Cyanobacteria Abstract: The living cell possesses extraordinary molecular and biochemical mechanisms by which to recognize and efficiently remove foreign, damaged, or denatured proteins. This essential function has been a barrier to the overexpression of recombinant proteins in most expression systems. A notable exception is the overexpression in E. coli of recombinant proteins, most of which, however, end-up as "inclusion bodies", i.e., cytoplasmic aggregates of proteins that are inaccessible to the cell's proteasome. "Fusion constructs as protein overexpression vectors" proved to be unparalleled in their ability to cause substantial accumulation of recombinant proteins from plants, animals, and bacteria, as soluble proteins in unicellular cyanobacteria. Recombinant protein levels in the range of 10-20% of the total cellular protein can be achieved. The present work investigated this unique property in the context of recombinant protein stability in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 by developing and applying an in vivo cellular tobacco etch virus cleavage system with the objective of separating the target heterologous proteins from their fusion leader sequences. The work provides new insights about the overexpression, cellular stability, and exploitation of transgenes with commercial interest, highly expressed in a cyanobacterial biofactory. The results support the notion that eukaryotic plant- and animal-origin recombinant proteins are unstable, when free in the cyanobacterial cytosol but stable when in a fusion configuration with a highly expressed cyanobacterial native or heterologous protein. Included in this analysis are recombinant proteins of the plant isoprenoid biosynthetic pathway (isoprene synthase, β-phellandrene synthase, geranyl diphosphate synthase), the human interferon protein, as well as prokaryotic proteins (tetanus toxin fragment C and the antibiotic resistance genes kanamycin and chloramphenicol). The future success of synthetic biology approaches with cyanobacteria and other systems would require overexpression of pathway enzymes to attain product volume, and the work reported in this paper sets the foundation for such recombinant pathway enzyme overexpression.	0
Title: Molecular analysis of the benastatin biosynthetic pathway and genetic engineering of altered fatty acid-polyketide hybrids Abstract: The entire gene locus encoding the biosynthesis of the potent glutathione-S-transferase inhibitors and apoptosis inducers benastatin A and B has been cloned and sequenced. The cluster identity was unequivocally proven by deletion of flanking regions and heterologous expression in S. albus and S. lividans. Inactivation and complementation experiments revealed that a KSIII component (BenQ) similar to FabH is crucial for providing and selecting the rare hexanoate PKS starter unit. In the absence of BenQ, several novel penta- and hexacyclic benastatin derivatives with antiproliferative activities are formed. In total, five new compounds were isolated and fully characterized, and the chemical analysis was confirmed by derivatization. The most intriguing observation is that the ben PKS can utilize typical straight and branched fatty acid synthase primers. If shorter straight-chain starters are utilized, the length of the polyketide backbone is increased, resulting in the formation of an extended, hexacyclic ring system reminiscent of proposed intermediates in the griseorhodin and fredericamycin pathways. Analysis and manipulation of the hybrid fatty acid polyketide pathway provides strong support for the hypothesis that the number of chain elongations is dependent on the total size of the polyketide chain that is accommodated in the PKS enzyme cavity. Our results also further substantiate the potential of metabolic engineering toward polyphenols with altered substituents and ring systems.	1
Title: Physical linkage and transcriptional orientation of the tdc operon on the Escherichia coli chromosome Abstract: The physical and genetic structure of 37 kilobases of DNA encompassing the tdc region at 68.3 min of the Escherichia coli chromosome was determined by DNA sequence analysis and restriction mapping. Re-examination of new data concerning the direction of transcription of the tdc operon revealed that in strain W3110 the tdc region is located on a transposable segment of DNA.	0
Title: Biosynthesis of akaeolide and lorneic acids and annotation of type I polyketide synthase gene clusters in the genome of Streptomyces sp. NPS554 Abstract: The incorporation pattern of biosynthetic precursors into two structurally unique polyketides, akaeolide and lorneic acid A, was elucidated by feeding experiments with 13C-labeled precursors. In addition, the draft genome sequence of the producer, Streptomyces sp. NPS554, was performed and the biosynthetic gene clusters for these polyketides were identified. The putative gene clusters contain all the polyketide synthase (PKS) domains necessary for assembly of the carbon skeletons. Combined with the 13C-labeling results, gene function prediction enabled us to propose biosynthetic pathways involving unusual carbon-carbon bond formation reactions. Genome analysis also indicated the presence of at least ten orphan type I PKS gene clusters that might be responsible for the production of new polyketides.	1
Title: FeII4L4 Tetrahedron Binds to Nonpaired DNA Bases Abstract: A water-soluble self-assembled supramolecular FeII4L4 tetrahedron binds to single stranded DNA, mismatched DNA base pairs, and three-way DNA junctions. Binding of the coordination cage quenches fluorescent labels on the DNA strand, which provides an optical means to detect the interaction and allows the position of the binding site to be gauged with respect to the fluorescent label. Utilizing the quenching and binding properties of the coordination cage, we developed a simple and rapid detection method based on fluorescence quenching to detect unpaired bases in double-stranded DNA.	0
Title: Genome-wide analysis of Candida albicans gene expression patterns during infection of the mammalian kidney Abstract: Global analysis of the molecular responses of microbial pathogens to their mammalian hosts represents a major challenge. To date few microarray studies have been performed on Candida albicans cells derived from infected tissues. In this study we examined the C. albicans SC5314 transcriptome from renal infections in the rabbit. Genes involved in adhesion, stress adaptation and the assimilation of alternative carbon sources were up-regulated in these cells compared with control cells grown in RPMI 1640, whereas genes involved in morphogenesis, fermentation and translation were down-regulated. When we compared the congenic virulent C. albicans strains NGY152 and SC5314, there was minimal overlap between their transcriptomes during kidney infections. This suggests that much of the gene regulation observed during infections is not essential for virulence. Indeed, we observed a poor correlation between the transcriptome and phenome for those genes that were regulated during kidney infection and that have been virulence tested.	0
Title: Evaluation of traditional Chinese medicinal plants for anti-MRSA activity with reference to the treatment record of infectious diseases Abstract: The in vitro antimicrobial activities of 30 Chinese medicinal plants were evaluated with reference to the treatment record of infectious diseases in the Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) literature. The plant materials were extracted with 80% ethanol and the extracts were primarily screened against conventional clinical pathogens like Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans by the agar diffusion method. Their inhibition zone diameters (IZDs, mm, 50 mg/mL) ranged from 2,048 by the standard broth microdilution method. The seven extracts from M. yunnanensis, S. sinensis, G. morella, E. daneillii, M. squamulata, S. arborescens and B. hancei were determined as the most active extracts, with MICs of 8-64 μg/mL. The results were in good agreement with their traditional applications in skin and other infections.	0
Title: Biosynthesis of the Bis-Prenylated Alkaloids Muscoride A and B Abstract: Prenylation is a common step in the biosynthesis of many natural products and plays an important role in increasing their structural diversity and enhancing biological activity. Muscoride A is a linear peptide alkaloid that contain two contiguous oxazoles and unusual prenyl groups that protect the amino- and carboxy-termini. Here we identified the 12.7 kb muscoride (mus) biosynthetic gene clusters from Nostoc spp. PCC 7906 and UHCC 0398. The mus biosynthetic gene clusters encode enzymes for the heterocyclization, oxidation, and prenylation of the MusE precursor protein. The mus biosynthetic gene clusters encode two copies of the cyanobactin prenyltransferase, MusF1 and MusF2. The predicted tetrapeptide substrate of MusF1 and MusF2 was synthesized through a novel tandem cyclization route in only eight steps. Biochemical assays demonstrated that MusF1 acts on the carboxy-terminus while MusF2 acts on the amino-terminus of the tetrapeptide substrate. We show that the MusF2 enzyme catalyzes the reverse or forward prenylation of amino-termini from Nostoc spp. PCC 7906 and UHCC 0398, respectively. This finding expands the regiospecific chemical functionality of cyanobactin prenyltransferases and the chemical diversity of the cyanobactin family of natural products to include bis-prenylated polyoxazole linear peptides.	1
Title: Cyclic depsipeptides, ichthyopeptins A and B, from Microcystis ichthyoblabe Abstract: Bioassay-guided isolation of antiviral compounds from the cultured cyanobacterium Microcystis ichthyoblabe provided two novel cyclic depsipeptides, ichthyopeptins A (1) and B (2). Their structures were determined by 1D (1H and 13C) and 2D (COSY, TOCSY, ROESY, HMQC, and HMBC) NMR spectra, ESIMS-MS, and amino acid analysis. The fraction containing both cyclic depsipeptides exhibited antiviral activity against influenza A virus with an IC50 value of 12.5 microg/mL.	0

The structure was determined by NMR analysis and degradation experiments.	0
Title: TB screening in Canadian health care workers using interferon-gamma release assays Abstract: Background:                       While many North American healthcare institutions are switching from Tuberculin Skin Test (TST) to Interferon-gamma release assays (IGRAs), there is relatively limited data on association between occupational tuberculosis (TB) risk factors and test positivity and/or patterns of test discordance.                  Methods:                       We recruited a cohort of Canadian health care workers (HCWs) in Montreal, and performed both TST and QuantiFERON-TB Gold In Tube (QFT) tests, and assessed risk factors and occupational exposure.                  Results:                       In a cross-sectional analysis of baseline results, the prevalence of TST positivity using the 10 mm cut-off was 5.7% (22/388, 95%CI: 3.6-8.5%), while QFT positivity was 6.2% (24/388, 95%CI: 4-9.1%). Overall agreement between the tests was poor (kappa=0.26), and 8.3% of HCWs had discordant test results, most frequently TST-/QFT+ (17/388, 4.4%). TST positivity was associated with total years worked in health care, non-occupational exposure to TB and BCG vaccination received after infancy or on multiple occasions. QFT positivity was associated with having worked as a HCW in a foreign country.                  Conclusions:                       Our results suggest that LTBI prevalence as measured by either the TST or the QFT is low in this HCW population. Of concern is the high frequency of unexplainable test discordance, namely: TST-/QFT+ subjects, and the lack of any association between QFT positivity and clear-cut recent TB exposure. If these discordant results are indeed false positives, the use of QFT in lieu of TST in low TB incidence settings could result in overtreatment of uninfected individuals.	0
Title: Elucidation of final steps of the marineosins biosynthetic pathway through identification and characterization of the corresponding gene cluster Abstract: The marine Streptomyces sp. CNQ-617 produces two diastereomers, marineosins A and B. These are structurally related to alkyl prodiginines, but with a more complex cyclization and an unusual spiroaminal skeleton. We report the identification of the mar biosynthetic gene cluster and demonstrate production of marineosins through heterologous expression in a S. venezuelae host named JND2. The mar cluster shares the same gene organization and has high homology to the genes of the red cluster (which directs the biosynthesis of undecylprodiginine) but contains an additional gene, named marA. Replacement of marA in the JND2 strain leads to the accumulation of premarineosin, which is identical to marineosin with the exception that the middle pyrrole (Ring B) has not been reduced. The final step of the marineosin pathway is thus a MarA catalyzed reduction of this ring. Replacement of marG (a homologue of redG that directs undecylprodiginine cyclization to give streptorubin B) in the JND2 strain leads to the loss of all spiroaminal products and the accumulation of 23-hydroxyundecylprodiginine and a shunt product, 23-ketoundecylprodiginine. MarG thus catalyzes the penultimate step of the marineosin pathway catalyzing conversion of 23-hydroxyundecylprodiginine to premarineosin. The preceding steps of the biosynthetic marineosin pathway likely mirror that in the red-directed biosynthetic process, with the exception of the introduction of the hydroxyl functionality required for spiroaminal formation. This work presents the first experimentally supported scheme for biosynthesis of marineosin and provides a new biologically active molecule, premarineosin.	1
Title: Lysine-91 of the tetraheme c-type cytochrome CymA is essential for quinone interaction and arsenate respiration in Shewanella sp. strain ANA-3 Abstract: The tetraheme c-type cytochrome, CymA, is essential for arsenate respiratory reduction in Shewanella sp. ANA-3, a model arsenate reducer. CymA is predicted to mediate electron transfer from quinols to the arsenate respiratory reductase (ArrAB). Here, we present biochemical and physiological evidence that CymA interacts with menaquinol (MQH(2)) substrates. Fluorescence quench titration with the MQH(2) analog, 2-n-heptyl-4-hydroxyquinoline-N-oxide (HOQNO), was used to demonstrate quinol binding of E. coli cytoplasmic membranes enriched with various forms of CymA. Wild-type CymA bound HOQNO with a K (d) of 0.1-1 microM. It was also shown that the redox active MQH(2) analog, 2,3-dimethoxy-1,4-naphthoquinone (DMNH(2)), could reduce CymA in cytoplasmic membrane preparations. Based on a CymA homology model made from the NrfH tetraheme cytochrome structure, it was predicted that Lys91 would be involved in CymA-quinol interactions. CymA with a K91Q substitution showed little interaction with HOQNO. In addition, DMNH(2)-dependent reduction of CymA-K91Q was diminished by 45% compared to wild-type CymA. A DeltacymA ANA-3 strain containing a plasmid copy of cymA-K91Q failed to grow with arsenate as an electron acceptor. These results suggest that Lys91 is physiologically important for arsenate respiration and support the hypothesis that CymA interacts with menaquinol resulting in the reduction of the cytochrome.	0
Title: Characterization of the alnumycin gene cluster reveals unusual gene products for pyran ring formation and dioxan biosynthesis Abstract: Alnumycin is closely related to the benzoisochromanequinone (BIQ) polyketides such as actinorhodin. Exceptional structural features include differences in aglycone tailoring that result in the unique alnumycin chromophore and the existence of an unusual 4-hydroxymethyl-5-hydroxy-1,3-dioxan moiety. Cloning and sequencing of the alnumycin gene cluster from Streptomyces sp. CM020 revealed expected biosynthesis genes for polyketide assembly, but several genes encoding subsequent tailoring enzymes were highly atypical. Heterologous expression studies confirmed that all of the genes required for alnumycin biosynthesis resided within the sequenced clone. Inactivation of genes aln4 and aln5 showed that the mechanism of pyran ring formation differs from actinorhodin and granaticin pathways. Further inactivation studies identified two genes, alnA and alnB, involved in the synthesis and attachment of the dioxan moiety, and resulted in the production of the polyketide prealnumycin.	1
Title: Lantibiotics from Geobacillus thermodenitrificans Abstract: The lantibiotic nisin has been used as an effective food preservative to combat food-borne pathogens for over 40 y. Despite this successful use, nisin's stability at pH 7 is limited. Herein, we describe a nisin analog encoded on the genome of the thermophilic bacterium Geobacillus thermodenitrificans NG80-2. This analog termed geobacillin I was obtained by heterologous expression in Escherichia coli and subsequent purification. Extensive NMR characterization demonstrated that geobacillin I contains seven thioether cross-links, two more than the five cross-links found in nisin and the most cross-links found in any lantibiotic to date. The antimicrobial spectrum of geobacillin I was generally similar to that of nisin A, with increased activity against Streptococcus dysgalactiae, one of the causative agents of bovine mastitis. Geobacillin I demonstrated increased stability compared to nisin A. In addition to geobacillin I, the genome of G. thermodenitrificans NG80-2 also contains a class II lantibiotic biosynthetic gene cluster. The corresponding compound was produced in E. coli, and has a ring topology different than that of any known lantibiotic as determined by tandem mass spectrometry. Interestingly, geobacillin II only demonstrated antimicrobial activity against Bacillus strains. Seven Geobacillus strains were screened for production of the geobacillins using whole-cell MALDI-MS and five were shown to produce geobacillin I, but none produced geobacillin II.	1
Title: The hmsT 3' untranslated region mediates c-di-GMP metabolism and biofilm formation in Yersinia pestis Abstract: Yersinia pestis, the cause of plague, forms a biofilm in the proventriculus of its flea vector to enhance transmission. Biofilm formation in Y. pestis is regulated by the intracellular levels of cyclic diguanylate (c-di-GMP). In this study, we investigated the role of the 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) in hmsT mRNA, a transcript that encodes a diguanylate cyclase that stimulates biofilm formation in Y. pestis by synthesizing the second messenger c-di-GMP. Deletion of the 3'UTR increased the half-life of hmsT mRNA, thereby upregulating c-di-GMP levels and biofilm formation. Our findings indicate that multiple regulatory sequences might be present in the hmsT 3'UTR that function together to mediate mRNA turnover. We also found that polynucleotide phosphorylase is partially responsible for hmsT 3'UTR-mediated mRNA decay. In addition, the hmsT 3'UTR strongly repressed gene expression at 37°C and 26°C, but affected gene expression only slightly at 21°C. Our findings suggest that the 3'UTR might be involved in precise and rapid regulation of hmsT expression, allowing Y. pestis to fine-tune c-di-GMP synthesis and consequently regulate biofilm production to adapt to the changing host environment.	0
Title: High-Throughput, Label-Free Isolation of Cancer Stem Cells on the Basis of Cell Adhesion Capacity Abstract: Herein we report a microfluidics method that enriches cancer stem cells (CSCs) or tumor-initiating cells on the basis of cell adhesion properties. In our on-chip enrichment system, cancer cells were driven by hydrodynamic forces to flow through microchannels coated with basement membrane extract. Highly adhesive cells were captured by the functionalized microchannels, and less adhesive cells were collected from the outlets. Two heterogeneous breast cancer cell lines (SUM-149 and SUM-159) were successfully separated into enriched subpopulations according to their adhesive capacity, and the enrichment of the cancer stem cells was confirmed by flow cytometry biomarker analysis and tumor-formation assays. Our findings show that the less adhesive phenotype is associated with a higher percentage of CSCs, higher cancer-cell motility, and higher resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs.	0
Title: Quorum-sensing crosstalk-driven synthetic circuits: from unimodality to trimodality Abstract: Widespread quorum-sensing (QS) enables bacteria to communicate and plays a critical role in controlling bacterial virulence. However, effects of promiscuous QS crosstalk and its implications for gene regulation and cell decision-making remain largely unknown. Here we systematically studied the crosstalk between LuxR/I and LasR/I systems and found that QS crosstalk can be dissected into signal crosstalk and promoter crosstalk. Further investigations using synthetic positive feedback circuits revealed that signal crosstalk significantly decreases a circuit's bistable potential while maintaining unimodality. Promoter crosstalk, however, reproducibly generates complex trimodal responses resulting from noise-induced state transitions and host-circuit interactions. A mathematical model that integrates the circuit's nonlinearity, stochasticity, and host-circuit interactions was developed, and its predictions of conditions for trimodality were verified experimentally. Combining synthetic biology and mathematical modeling, this work sheds light on the complex behaviors emerging from QS crosstalk, which could be exploited for therapeutics and biotechnology.	0
Title: Genetic organization of the O7-specific lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis cluster of Escherichia coli VW187 (O7:K1) Abstract: In previous studies the authors cloned and characterized the DNA sequence of the regions at both ends of the O7-specific lipopolysaccharide (LPS) biosynthesis cluster of Escherichia coli VW187 (O7:K1), and identified the biosynthetic genes for dTDP-rhamnose and GDP-mannose, as well as one of the candidate glycosyltransferases. In this work the complete DNA sequence of a 6.9 kb intervening region is presented. Seven new ORFs were identified. All the functions required for the synthesis and transfer of the O7 LPS were assigned on the basis of complementation experiments of transposon insertion mutants, and amino acid sequence homology to proteins involved in LPS synthesis of other bacteria. Of the seven ORFs, two encoded membrane proteins that were homologous to the O-antigen translocase (Wzx) and polymerase (Wxy), two were involved in the biosynthesis of dTDP-N-acetylviosamine, and the remaining three showed homologies to sugar transferases. The O antigen chain length regulator gene wzz was also identified in the vicinity of the O7 polysaccharide cluster. O7-specific DNA primers were designed and tested for serotyping of O7 E. coli strains.	1
Title: Genomics-Driven Discovery of NO-Donating Diazeniumdiolate Siderophores in Diverse Plant-Associated Bacteria Abstract: Siderophores are key players in bacteria-host interactions, with the main function to provide soluble iron for their producers. Gramibactin from rhizosphere bacteria expands siderophore function and diversity as it delivers iron to the host plant and features an unusual diazeniumdiolate moiety for iron chelation. By mutational analysis of the grb gene cluster, we identified genes (grbD and grbE) necessary for diazeniumdiolate formation. Genome mining using a GrbD-based network revealed a broad range of orthologous gene clusters in mainly plant-associated Burkholderia/Paraburkholderia species. Two new types of diazeniumdiolate siderophores, megapolibactins and plantaribactin were fully characterized. In vitro assays and in vivo monitoring experiments revealed that the iron chelators also liberate nitric oxide (NO) in plant roots. This finding is important since NO donors are considered as biofertilizers that maintain iron homeostasis and increase overall plant fitness.	1
Title: Oxygen-18 Kinetic Isotope Effects of Nonheme Iron Enzymes HEPD and MPnS Support Iron(III) Superoxide as the Hydrogen Abstraction Species Abstract: Nonheme iron oxygenases that carry out four-electron oxidations of substrate have been proposed to employ iron(III) superoxide species to initiate this reaction [Paria, S.; Que, L.; Paine, T. K. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2011, 50, 11129]. Here we report experimental evidence in support of this proposal. (18)O KIEs were measured for two recently discovered mononuclear nonheme iron oxygenases: hydroxyethylphosphonate dioxygenase (HEPD) and methylphosphonate synthase (MPnS). Competitive (18)O KIEs measured with deuterated substrates are larger than those measured with unlabeled substrates, which indicates that C-H cleavage must occur before an irreversible reductive step at molecular oxygen. A similar observation was previously used to implicate copper(II) superoxide in the H-abstraction reactions catalyzed by dopamine β-monooxygenase [Tian, G. C.; Klinman, J. P. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993, 115, 8891] and peptidylglycine α-hydroxylating monooxygenase [Francisco, W. A.; Blackburn, N. J.; Klinman, J. P. Biochemistry 2003, 42, 1813].	0
Title: Mutation of His-157 in the second pore loop drastically reduces the activity of the Synechocystis Ktr-type transporter Abstract: Mutation of a conserved His-157 in the second pore loop of KtrB drastically reduced the activity of the K+ transporter from Synechocystis sp. strain PCC 6803. This result suggests that His-157 plays an essential role in the K+ transport activity of the transporter system.	0
Title: Kinetic mechanism of human histidine triad nucleotide binding protein 1 Abstract: Human histidine triad nucleotide binding protein 1 (hHint1) is a member of a ubiquitous and ancient branch of the histidine triad protein superfamily. hHint1 is a homodimeric protein that catalyzes the hydrolysis of model substrates, phosphoramidate and acyl adenylate, with a high efficiency. Recently, catalytically inactive hHint1 has been identified as the cause of inherited peripheral neuropathy [Zimon, M., et al. (2012) Nat. Genet. 44, 1080-1083]. We have conducted the first detailed kinetic mechanistic studies of hHint1 and have found that the reaction mechanism is consistent with a double-displacement mechanism, in which the active site nucleophile His112 is first adenylylated by the substrate, followed by hydrolysis of the AMP-enzyme intermediate. A transient burst phase followed by a linear phase from the stopped-flow fluorescence assay indicated that enzyme adenylylation was faster than the subsequent intermediate hydrolysis and product release. Solvent viscosity experiments suggested that both chemical transformation and diffusion-sensitive events (product release or protein conformational change) limit the overall turnover. The catalytic trapping experiments and data simulation indicated that the true koff rate of the final product AMP is unlikely to control the overall kcat. Therefore, a protein conformational change associated with product release is likely rate-limiting. In addition, the rate of Hint1 adenylylation was found to be dependent on two residues with pKa values of 6.5 and 8, with the former pKa agreeing well with the nuclear magnetic resonance titration results for the pKa of the active site nucleophile His112. In comparison to the uncatalyzed rates, hHint1 was shown to enhance acyl-AMP and AMP phosphoramidate hydrolysis by 10(6)-10(8)-fold. Taken together, our analysis indicates that hHint1 catalyzes the hydrolysis of phosphoramidate and acyl adenylate with high efficiency, through a mechanism that relies on rapid adenylylation of the active residue, His112, while being partially rate-limited by intermediate hydrolysis and product release associated with a conformational change. Given the high degree of sequence homology of Hint proteins across all kingdoms of life, it is likely that their kinetic and catalytic mechanisms will be similar to those elucidated for hHint1.	0
Title: Gene cluster responsible for validamycin biosynthesis in Streptomyces hygroscopicus subsp. jinggangensis 5008 Abstract: A gene cluster responsible for the biosynthesis of validamycin, an aminocyclitol antibiotic widely used as a control agent for sheath blight disease of rice plants, was identified from Streptomyces hygroscopicus subsp. jinggangensis 5008 using heterologous probe acbC, a gene involved in the cyclization of D-sedoheptulose 7-phosphate to 2-epi-5-epi-valiolone of the acarbose biosynthetic gene cluster originated from Actinoplanes sp. strain SE50/110. Deletion of a 30-kb DNA fragment from this cluster in the chromosome resulted in loss of validamycin production, confirming a direct involvement of the gene cluster in the biosynthesis of this important plant protectant. A sequenced 6-kb fragment contained valA (an acbC homologue encoding a putative cyclase) as well as two additional complete open reading frames (valB and valC, encoding a putative adenyltransferase and a kinase, respectively), which are organized as an operon. The function of ValA was genetically demonstrated to be essential for validamycin production and biochemically shown to be responsible specifically for the cyclization of D-sedoheptulose 7-phosphate to 2-epi-5-epi-valiolone in vitro using the ValA protein heterologously overexpressed in E. coli. The information obtained should pave the way for further detailed analysis of the complete biosynthetic pathway, which would lead to a complete understanding of validamycin biosynthesis.	1
Title: Identification of nocamycin biosynthetic gene cluster from Saccharothrix syringae NRRL B-16468 and generation of new nocamycin derivatives by manipulating gene cluster Abstract: Background:                       Nocamycins I and II, produced by the rare actinomycete Saccharothrix syringae, belong to the tetramic acid family natural products. Nocamycins show potent antimicrobial activity and they hold great potential for antibacterial agent design. However, up to now, little is known about the exact biosynthetic mechanism of nocamycin.                  Results:                       In this report, we identified the gene cluster responsible for nocamycin biosynthesis from S. syringae and generated new nocamycin derivatives by manipulating its gene cluster. The biosynthetic gene cluster for nocamycin contains a 61 kb DNA locus, consisting of 21 open reading frames (ORFs). Five type I polyketide synthases (NcmAI, NcmAII, NcmAIII, NcmAIV, NcmAV) and a non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NcmB) are proposed to be involved in synthesis of the backbone structure, a Dieckmann cyclase NcmC catalyze the releasing of linear chain and the formation of tetramic acid moiety, five enzymes (NcmEDGOP) are related to post-tailoring steps, and five enzymes (NcmNJKIM) function as regulators. Targeted inactivation of ncmB led to nocamycin production being completely abolished, which demonstrates that this gene cluster is involved in nocamycin biosynthesis. To generate new nocamycin derivatives, the gene ncmG, encoding for a cytochrome P450 oxidase, was inactivated. Two new nocamycin derivatives nocamycin III and nocamycin IV were isolated from the ncmG deletion mutant strain and their structures were elucidated by spectroscopic data analyses. Based on bioinformatics analysis and new derivatives isolated from gene inactivation mutant strains, a biosynthetic pathway of nocamycins was proposed.                  Conclusion:                       These findings provide the basis for further understanding of nocamycin biosynthetic mechanism, and set the stage to rationally engineer new nocamycin derivatives via combinatorial biosynthesis strategy.	1
Title: Tandem carbocupration/oxygenation of terminal alkynes Abstract: [chemical reaction: see text]. A direct and general synthesis of alpha-branched aldehydes and their enol derivatives is described. Carbocupration of terminal alkynes and subsequent oxygenation with lithium tert-butyl peroxide generates a metallo-enolate. Trapping with various electrophiles provides alpha-branched aldehydes or stereo-defined trisubstituted enol esters or silyl ethers. The tandem carbocupration/oxygenation tolerates alkyl and silyl ethers, esters, and tertiary amines. The reaction is effective with organocopper complexes derived from primary, secondary, and tertiary Grignard reagents and from n-butyllithium.	0
Title: Analysis of SNARE complex/synaptotagmin-1 interactions by one-dimensional NMR spectroscopy Abstract: Neurotransmitter release depends critically on the Ca(2+) sensor synaptotagmin-1 and the SNARE proteins syntaxin-1, synaptobrevin, and SNAP-25, which mediate membrane fusion by forming tight SNARE complexes that bridge the synaptic vesicle and plasma membranes. Interactions between the SNARE complex and the two C2 domains of synaptotagmin-1 (the C2A and C2B domains) are believed to play a key role in coupling Ca(2+) sensing to membrane fusion, but the nature of these interactions is unclear, in part because of a paucity of data obtained by quantitative biophysical methods. Here we have analyzed synaptotagmin-1/SNARE complex interactions by monitoring the decrease in the intensities of one-dimensional (13)C-edited (1)H NMR spectra of (13)C-labeled fragments of synaptotagmin-1 upon binding to unlabeled SNARE complex. Our results indicate that there is a primary binding mode between synaptotagmin-1 and the SNARE complex that involves a polybasic region in the C2B domain and has a sub-micromolar affinity. Our NMR data, combined with precipitation assays, show that there are additional SNARE complex/synaptotagmin-1 interactions that lead to aggregation and that involve in part two arginines at the bottom of the C2B domain. Overall, this study shows the importance of disentangling the contributions of different types of interactions to SNARE complex/synaptotagmin-1 binding and illustrates the usefulness of one-dimensional NMR methods to analyze intricate protein interactions.	0
Title: Convergent diversity-oriented side-chain macrocyclization scan for unprotected polypeptides Abstract: Here we describe a general synthetic platform for side-chain macrocyclization of an unprotected peptide library based on the SNAr reaction between cysteine thiolates and a new generation of highly reactive perfluoroaromatic small molecule linkers. This strategy enabled us to simultaneously "scan" two cysteine residues positioned from i, i + 1 to i, i + 14 sites in a polypeptide, producing 98 macrocyclic products from reactions of 14 peptides with 7 linkers. A complementary reverse strategy was developed; cysteine residues within the polypeptide were first modified with non-bridging perfluoroaryl moieties and then commercially available dithiol linkers were used for macrocyclization. The highly convergent, site-independent, and modular nature of these two strategies coupled with the unique chemoselectivity of a SNAr transformation allows for the rapid diversity-oriented synthesis of hybrid macrocyclic peptide libraries with varied chemical and structural complexities.	0
Title: Mutational analysis and reconstituted expression of the biosynthetic genes involved in the formation of 3-amino-5-hydroxybenzoic acid, the starter unit of rifamycin biosynthesis in amycolatopsis Mediterranei S699 Abstract: To investigate a novel branch of the shikimate biosynthesis pathway operating in the formation of 3-amino-5-hydroxybenzoic acid (AHBA), the unique biosynthetic precursor of rifamycin and related ansamycins, a series of target-directed mutations and heterologous gene expressions were investigated in Amycolatopsis mediterranei and Streptomyces coelicolor. The genes involved in AHBA formation were inactivated individually, and the resulting mutants were further examined by incubating the cell-free extracts with known intermediates of the pathway and analyzing for AHBA formation. The rifL, -M, and -N genes were shown to be involved in the step(s) from either phosphoenolpyruvate/d-erythrose 4-phosphate or other precursors to 3,4-dideoxy-4-amino-d-arabino-heptulosonate 7-phosphate. The gene products of the rifH, -G, and -J genes resemble enzymes involved in the shikimate biosynthesis pathway (August, P. R., Tang, L., Yoon, Y. J., Ning, S., Müller, R., Yu, T.-W., Taylor, M., Hoffmann, D., Kim, C.-G., Zhang, X., Hutchinson, C. R., and Floss, H. G. (1998) Chem. Biol. 5, 69-79). Mutants of the rifH and -J genes produced rifamycin B at 1% and 10%, respectively, of the yields of the wild type; inactivation of the rifG gene did not affect rifamycin production significantly. Finally, coexpressing the rifG-N and -J genes in S. coelicolor YU105 under the control of the act promoter led to significant production of AHBA in the fermented cultures, confirming that seven of these genes are indeed necessary and sufficient for AHBA formation. The effects of deletion of individual genes from the heterologous expression cassette on AHBA formation duplicated the effects of the genomic rifG-N and -J mutations on rifamycin production, indicating that all these genes encode proteins with catalytic rather than regulatory functions in AHBA formation for rifamycin biosynthesis by A. mediterranei.	1
Title: Reciprocal Regulation of ERα and ERβ Stability and Activity by Diptoindonesin G Abstract: ERβ is regarded as a "tumor suppressor" in breast cancer due to its anti-proliferative effects. However, unlike ERα, ERβ has not been developed as a therapeutic target in breast cancer due to loss of ERβ in aggressive cancers. In a small-molecule library screen for ERβ stabilizers, we identified Diptoindonesin G (Dip G), which significantly increases ERβ protein stability while decreasing ERα protein levels. Dip G enhances the transcription and anti-proliferative activities of ERβ, while attenuating the transcription and proliferative effects of ERα. Further investigation revealed that instead of targeting ER, Dip G targets the CHIP E3 ubiquitin ligase shared by ERα and ERβ. Thus, Dip G is a dual-functional moiety that reciprocally controls ERα and ERβ protein stability and activities via an indirect mechanism. The ERβ stabilization effects of Dip G may enable the development of ERβ-targeted therapies for human breast cancers.	0
Title: A fungal ketoreductase domain that displays substrate-dependent stereospecificity Abstract: Iterative highly reducing polyketide synthases from filamentous fungi are the most complex and enigmatic type of polyketide synthase discovered to date. Here we uncover an unusual degree of programming by the hypothemycin highly reducing polyketide synthase, in which a single ketoreductase domain shows stereospecificity that is controlled by substrate length. Mapping of the structural domains responsible for this feature allowed for the biosynthesis of an unnatural diastereomer of the natural product dehydrozearalenol.	0
Title: The sequence of a 1.8-mb bacterial linear plasmid reveals a rich evolutionary reservoir of secondary metabolic pathways Abstract: Plasmids are mobile genetic elements that play a key role in the evolution of bacteria by mediating genome plasticity and lateral transfer of useful genetic information. Although originally considered to be exclusively circular, linear plasmids have also been identified in certain bacterial phyla, notably the actinomycetes. In some cases, linear plasmids engage with chromosomes in an intricate evolutionary interplay, facilitating the emergence of new genome configurations by transfer and recombination or plasmid integration. Genome sequencing of Streptomyces clavuligerus ATCC 27064, a Gram-positive soil bacterium known for its production of a diverse array of biotechnologically important secondary metabolites, revealed a giant linear plasmid of 1.8 Mb in length. This megaplasmid (pSCL4) is one of the largest plasmids ever identified and the largest linear plasmid to be sequenced. It contains more than 20% of the putative protein-coding genes of the species, but none of these is predicted to be essential for primary metabolism. Instead, the plasmid is densely packed with an exceptionally large number of gene clusters for the potential production of secondary metabolites, including a large number of putative antibiotics, such as staurosporine, moenomycin, beta-lactams, and enediynes. Interestingly, cross-regulation occurs between chromosomal and plasmid-encoded genes. Several factors suggest that the megaplasmid came into existence through recombination of a smaller plasmid with the arms of the main chromosome. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that heavy traffic of genetic information between Streptomyces plasmids and chromosomes may facilitate the rapid evolution of secondary metabolite repertoires in these bacteria.	1
Title: Metamorphic enzyme assembly in polyketide diversification Abstract: Natural product chemical diversity is fuelled by the emergence and ongoing evolution of biosynthetic pathways in secondary metabolism. However, co-evolution of enzymes for metabolic diversification is not well understood, especially at the biochemical level. Here, two parallel assemblies with an extraordinarily high sequence identity from Lyngbya majuscula form a beta-branched cyclopropane in the curacin A pathway (Cur), and a vinyl chloride group in the jamaicamide pathway (Jam). The components include a halogenase, a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl enzyme cassette for polyketide beta-branching, and an enoyl reductase domain. The halogenase from CurA, and the dehydratases (ECH(1)s), decarboxylases (ECH(2)s) and enoyl reductase domains from both Cur and Jam, were assessed biochemically to determine the mechanisms of cyclopropane and vinyl chloride formation. Unexpectedly, the polyketide beta-branching pathway was modified by introduction of a gamma-chlorination step on (S)-3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl mediated by Cur halogenase, a non-haem Fe(ii), alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent enzyme. In a divergent scheme, Cur ECH(2) was found to catalyse formation of the alpha,beta enoyl thioester, whereas Jam ECH(2) formed a vinyl chloride moiety by selectively generating the corresponding beta,gamma enoyl thioester of the 3-methyl-4-chloroglutaconyl decarboxylation product. Finally, the enoyl reductase domain of CurF specifically catalysed an unprecedented cyclopropanation on the chlorinated product of Cur ECH(2) instead of the canonical alpha,beta C = C saturation reaction. Thus, the combination of chlorination and polyketide beta-branching, coupled with mechanistic diversification of ECH(2) and enoyl reductase, leads to the formation of cyclopropane and vinyl chloride moieties. These results reveal a parallel interplay of evolutionary events in multienzyme systems leading to functional group diversity in secondary metabolites.	1
Title: The developmental regulator MtrA binds GlnR boxes and represses nitrogen metabolism genes in Streptomyces coelicolor Abstract: In Streptomyces, GlnR is an activator protein that activates nitrogen-assimilation genes under nitrogen-limiting conditions. However, less is known regarding the regulation of these genes under nitrogen-rich conditions. We determined that the developmental regulator MtrA represses nitrogen-assimilation genes in nitrogen-rich media and that it competes with GlnR for binding to GlnR boxes. The GlnR boxes upstream of multiple nitrogen genes, such as amtB, were confirmed as MtrA binding sites in vitro by electrophoretic mobility shift assays and in vivo by ChIP-qPCR analysis. Transcriptional analysis indicated that, on nutrient-rich medium, MtrA profoundly repressed expression of nitrogen-associated genes, indicating opposing roles for MtrA and GlnR in the control of nitrogen metabolism. Using in vitro and in vivo analysis, we also showed that glnR is itself a direct target of MtrA and that MtrA represses glnR transcription. We further demonstrated functional conservation of MtrA homologues in the recognition of GlnR boxes upstream of nitrogen genes from different actinobacterial species. As mtrA and glnR are widespread among actinomycetes, this mechanism of potential competitive control over nitrogen metabolism genes may be common in this group, adding a major new layer of complexity to the known regulatory network for nitrogen metabolism in Streptomyces and related species.	0
Title: Draft Genome Sequence of Amycolatopsis decaplanina Strain DSM 44594T Abstract: We report the 8.5-Mb genome sequence of Amycolatopsis decaplanina strain DSM 44594(T), isolated from a soil sample from India. The draft genome of strain DSM 44594(T) consists of 8,533,276 bp with a 68.6% G+C content, 7,899 protein-coding genes, and 57 RNAs.	1
Title: Performance and microbial community variations of anaerobic digesters under increasing tetracycline concentrations Abstract: The impact of different concentrations of tetracycline on the performance of anaerobic treatment was evaluated. Results revealed that for all of the tested tetracycline concentrations, no major sustained impact on methane production was observed. Instead, a significant increase in propionic acid was observed in the reactor subjected to the highest concentration of tetracycline (20 mg/L). Microbial community analyses suggest that an alternative methanogenic pathway, specifically that of methanol-utilizing methanogens, may be important for ensuring the stability of methane production in the presence of high tetracycline concentrations. In addition, the accumulation of propionate was due to an increase in volatile fatty acids (VFA)-producing bacteria coupled with a reduction in propionate utilizers. An increase in the abundance of tetracycline resistance genes associated with ribosomal protection proteins was observed after 30 days of exposure to high concentrations of tetracycline, while other targeted resistance genes showed no significant changes. These findings suggest that anaerobic treatment processes can robustly treat wastewater with varying concentrations of antibiotics while also deriving value-added products and minimizing the dissemination of associated antibiotic resistance genes.	0
Title: In vitro antibacterial activity of trospectomycin (U-63366F), a novel spectinomycin analog Abstract: Trospectomycin (U-63366F) is a novel spectinomycin analog with broad-spectrum antibacterial activity. The in vitro activity of this analog was compared with that of spectinomycin and other reference antibiotics against 411 clinical isolates of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. MICs were determined by agar or broth dilution methods. The stability of trospectomycin in the presence of an enzyme extract derived from spectinomycin-resistant Escherichia coli was determined. Trospectomycin was more active than spectinomycin (4- to 32-fold) against strains of numerous bacterial species, including staphylococci, streptococci, Haemophilus influenzae, Branhamella catarrhalis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Proteus species, Bacteroides species, Clostridium difficile, Clostridium species, and Chlamydia trachomatis. Trospectomycin demonstrated a moderate level of activity (comparable to that of spectinomycin) for most species of the family Enterobacteriaceae tested and was generally cross resistant with spectinomycin. Trospectomycin was susceptible to inactivation by crude enzyme preparations from spectinomycin-inactivating strains of E. coli. Trospectomycin inhibited a variety of clinically important organisms, including agents of sexually transmitted diseases and pelvic inflammatory disease. Clinical studies with this novel aminocyclitol antibiotic are in progress.	0
Title: 4-Hydroxy Pyridones from Heterologous Expression and Cultivation of the Native Host Abstract: 4-Hydroxy pyridones are a class of fungi-derived polyketide-nonribosomal peptide products featuring a core of 4-hydroxy-2-pyridone which have a wide range of biological activities. Genome mining of in-house strains using polyketide synthase-nonribosomal peptide synthase as a query identified an endophyte Tolypocladium sp. 49Y, which possesses a potential 4-hydroxy pyridone biosynthetic gene cluster. Heterologous expression in Aspergillus oryzae NSAR1 revealed that this gene cluster is functional and able to produce a rare type of 4-hydroxy pyridones called tolypyridones (compounds 3 and 4). Tolypocladium sp. 49Y was grown in a variety of media which led to the isolation of six 4-hydroxy pyridones (5-10) and one pyrrolidone (11) from a rice culture, and compounds 3 and 9 showed antifungal activity. These latter compounds are different from those obtained by heterologous expression. This study shows that both heterologous expression and cultivation of the native host are complementary approaches to discover new natural products.	1
Title: Systems perspectives on erythromycin biosynthesis by comparative genomic and transcriptomic analyses of S. erythraea E3 and NRRL23338 strains Abstract: Background:                       S. erythraea is a Gram-positive filamentous bacterium used for the industrial-scale production of erythromycin A which is of high clinical importance. In this work, we sequenced the whole genome of a high-producing strain (E3) obtained by random mutagenesis and screening from the wild-type strain NRRL23338, and examined time-series expression profiles of both E3 and NRRL23338. Based on the genomic data and transcriptpmic data of these two strains, we carried out comparative analysis of high-producing strain and wild-type strain at both the genomic level and the transcriptomic level.                  Results:                       We observed a large number of genetic variants including 60 insertions, 46 deletions and 584 single nucleotide variations (SNV) in E3 in comparison with NRRL23338, and the analysis of time series transcriptomic data indicated that the genes involved in erythromycin biosynthesis and feeder pathways were significantly up-regulated during the 60 hours time-course. According to our data, BldD, a previously identified ery cluster regulator, did not show any positive correlations with the expression of ery cluster, suggesting the existence of alternative regulation mechanisms of erythromycin synthesis in S. erythraea. Several potential regulators were then proposed by integration analysis of genomic and transcriptomic data.                  Conclusion:                       This is a demonstration of the functional comparative genomics between an industrial S. erythraea strain and the wild-type strain. These findings help to understand the global regulation mechanisms of erythromycin biosynthesis in S. erythraea, providing useful clues for genetic and metabolic engineering in the future.	1
Title: Evolution of vitamin B2 biosynthesis: 6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine synthases of Brucella Abstract: The penultimate step in the biosynthesis of riboflavin (vitamin B2) involves the condensation of 3,4-dihydroxy-2-butanone 4-phosphate with 5-amino-6-ribitylamino-2,4(1H,3H)-pyrimidinedione, which is catalyzed by 6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine synthase (lumazine synthase). Pathogenic Brucella species adapted to an intracellular lifestyle have two genes involved in riboflavin synthesis, ribH1 and ribH2, which are located on different chromosomes. The ribH2 gene was shown previously to specify a lumazine synthase (type II lumazine synthase) with an unusual decameric structure and a very high Km for 3,4-dihydroxy-2-butanone 4-phosphate. Moreover, the protein was found to be an immunodominant Brucella antigen and was able to generate strong humoral as well as cellular immunity against Brucella abortus in mice. We have now cloned and expressed the ribH1 gene, which is located inside a small riboflavin operon, together with two other putative riboflavin biosynthesis genes and the nusB gene, specifying an antitermination factor. The RibH1 protein (type I lumazine synthase) is a homopentamer catalyzing the formation of 6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine at a rate of 18 nmol mg(-1) min(-1). Sequence comparison of lumazine synthases from archaea, bacteria, plants, and fungi suggests a family of proteins comprising archaeal lumazine and riboflavin synthases, type I lumazine synthases, and the eubacterial type II lumazine synthases.	0
Title: Isolation and structure determination of new siderophore albachelin from Amycolatopsis alba Abstract: A new siderophore named albachelin was isolated from iron deficient culture of Amycolatopsis alba. The planar structure of albachelin was elucidated by the combination of ESI-MS/MS experiment and NMR spectroscopic analyses of the gallium (III) complex. The structure of albachelin was determined to be a linear peptide consisting of 6 mol of amino acids including 3 mol of serine, one mol each of N-α-acethyl-N-δ-hydroxy-N-δ-formylornithine, N-α-methyl-N-δ-hydroxyornithine, and cyclic N-hydroxyornithine. The stereochemistries of amino acids constituting albachelin were analyzed by applying modified Marfey method to the hydrolysate of albachelin. Based on bioinformatics, we deduced and discussed the possible biosynthetic gene cluster involved in albachelin biosynthesis from the genome sequence of A. alba. By prediction of substrates for adenylation domains, a non-ribosomal peptide biosynthetase gene (AMYAL_RS0130210) was proposed to be the main biosynthetic gene for albachelin biosynthesis. The related genes including transporter for siderophore were found near the NRPS gene as a gene cluster.	1
Title: Core assembly mechanism of quinocarcin/SF-1739: bimodular complex nonribosomal peptide synthetases for sequential mannich-type reactions Abstract: Quinocarcin and SF-1739, potent antitumor antibiotics, share a common tetracyclic tetrahydroisoquinoline (THIQ)-pyrrolidine core scaffold. Herein, we describe the identification of their biosynthetic gene clusters and biochemical analysis of Qcn18/Cya18 generating the previously unidentified extender unit dehydroarginine, which is a component of the pyrrolidine ring. ATP-inorganic pyrophosphate exchange experiments with five nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) enabled us to identify their substrates. On the basis of these data, we propose that a biosynthetic pathway comprising a three-component NRPS/MbtH family protein complex, Qcn16/17/19, plays a key role in the construction of tetracyclic THIQ-pyrrolidine core scaffold involving sequential Pictet-Spengler and intramolecular Mannich reactions. Furthermore, data derived from gene inactivation experiments led us to propose late-modification steps of quinocarcin.	1
Title: Turnerbactin, a novel triscatecholate siderophore from the shipworm endosymbiont Teredinibacter turnerae T7901 Abstract: Shipworms are marine bivalve mollusks (Family Teredinidae) that use wood for shelter and food. They harbor a group of closely related, yet phylogenetically distinct, bacterial endosymbionts in bacteriocytes located in the gills. This endosymbiotic community is believed to support the host's nutrition in multiple ways, through the production of cellulolytic enzymes and the fixation of nitrogen. The genome of the shipworm endosymbiont Teredinibacter turnerae T7901 was recently sequenced and in addition to the potential for cellulolytic enzymes and diazotrophy, the genome also revealed a rich potential for secondary metabolites. With nine distinct biosynthetic gene clusters, nearly 7% of the genome is dedicated to secondary metabolites. Bioinformatic analyses predict that one of the gene clusters is responsible for the production of a catecholate siderophore. Here we describe this gene cluster in detail and present the siderophore product from this cluster. Genes similar to the entCEBA genes of enterobactin biosynthesis involved in the production and activation of dihydroxybenzoic acid (DHB) are present in this cluster, as well as a two-module non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS). A novel triscatecholate siderophore, turnerbactin, was isolated from the supernatant of iron-limited T. turnerae T7901 cultures. Turnerbactin is a trimer of N-(2,3-DHB)-L-Orn-L-Ser with the three monomeric units linked by Ser ester linkages. A monomer, dimer, dehydrated dimer, and dehydrated trimer of 2,3-DHB-L-Orn-L-Ser were also found in the supernatant. A link between the gene cluster and siderophore product was made by constructing a NRPS mutant, TtAH03. Siderophores could not be detected in cultures of TtAH03 by HPLC analysis and Fe-binding activity of culture supernatant was significantly reduced. Regulation of the pathway by iron is supported by identification of putative Fur box sequences and observation of increased Fe-binding activity under iron restriction. Evidence of a turnerbactin fragment was found in shipworm extracts, suggesting the production of turnerbactin in the symbiosis.	1
Title: The potential of mineral weathering of halophilic-endophytic bacteria isolated from Suaeda salsa and Spartina anglica Abstract: Bacteria have the abilities of salt tolerant, mineral weathering and plant growth promoting can promote the growth of plants in saline lands. However, few reports of the mineral weathering capacity of halophilic-endophytic bacteria, raising the question of whether the halophilic-endophytic weathering bacteria are fundamentally distinct from those in plants communities. In this study, we isolated and characterized halophilic bacterial strains from the roots and leaves of Suaeda salsa and Spartina anglica with respect to their mineral weathering pattern, role in the promoting plant growth, community structure, and their changes in these two plants. Using improved Gibbson medium, we obtained 156 halophilic bacterial strains, among which 92 and 64 strains were isolated from the S. salsa and S. anglica samples, respectively. The rock weathering patterns of the isolates were characterized using batch cultures that measure the quantity of Si, Al, K, and Fe released from crystal biotite under aerobic conditions. Significantly, the biomass and capacity of the mineral weathering of the halophilic-endophytic bacteria were different in the plants. The abundance of the halophilic-endophytic bacterials in the Suaeda salsa was significantly greater than Spartina anglica, whereas the mineral weathering bacterial in the Suaeda salsa was similar to the Spartina anglica. Furthermore, the proportion of plant growth-promoting bacteria in the Suaeda salsa was higher than Spartina anglica. Phylogenetic analyses show that the weathered minerals were inhabited by specific functional groups of bacteria (Halomonas, Acinetobacter, Burkholderia, Alcaligenes, Sphingobium, Arthrobacter, Chryseobacterium, Paenibacillus, Microbacterium, Ensifer, Ralstonia and Enterobacter) that contribute to the mineral weathering. The changes in halophilic endophytes weathering communities between the two plants were attributable not only to major bacterial groups but also to a change in the minor population structure.	0
Title: Streptocollin, a Type IV Lanthipeptide Produced by Streptomyces collinus Tü 365 Abstract: Lanthipeptides are ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified microbial secondary metabolites. Here, we report the identification and isolation of streptocollin from Streptomyces collinus Tü 365, a new member of class IV lanthipeptides. Insertion of the constitutive ermE* promoter upstream of the lanthipeptide synthetase gene stcL resulted in peptide production. The streptocollin gene cluster was heterologously expressed in S. coelicolor M1146 and M1152 with 3.5- and 5.5-fold increased yields, respectively. The structure and ring topology of streptocollin were determined by high resolution MS/MS analysis. Streptocollin contains four macrocyclic rings, with one lanthionine and three methyllanthionine residues. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the isolation of a class IV lanthipeptide in preparative amounts, and on the successful heterologous expression of a class IV lanthipeptide gene cluster.	1
Title: QFlow lite dataset: A machine-learning approach to the charge states in quantum dot experiments Abstract: Background:                       Over the past decade, machine learning techniques have revolutionized how research and science are done, from designing new materials and predicting their properties to data mining and analysis to assisting drug discovery to advancing cybersecurity. Recently, we added to this list by showing how a machine learning algorithm (a so-called learner) combined with an optimization routine can assist experimental efforts in the realm of tuning semiconductor quantum dot (QD) devices. Among other applications, semiconductor quantum dots are a candidate system for building quantum computers. In order to employ QDs, one needs to tune the devices into a desirable configuration suitable for quantum computing. While current experiments adjust the control parameters heuristically, such an approach does not scale with the increasing size of the quantum dot arrays required for even near-term quantum computing demonstrations. Establishing a reliable protocol for tuning QD devices that does not rely on the gross-scale heuristics developed by experimentalists is thus of great importance.                  Materials and methods:                       To implement the machine learning-based approach, we constructed a dataset of simulated QD device characteristics, such as the conductance and the charge sensor response versus the applied electrostatic gate voltages. The gate voltages are the experimental 'knobs' for tuning the device into useful regimes. Here, we describe the methodology for generating the dataset, as well as its validation in training convolutional neural networks.                  Results and discussion:                       From 200 training sets sampled randomly from the full dataset, we show that the learner's accuracy in recognizing the state of a device is ≈ 96.5% when using either current-based or charge-sensor-based training. The spread in accuracy over our 200 training sets is 0.5% and 1.8% for current- and charge-sensor-based data, respectively. In addition, we also introduce a tool that enables other researchers to use this approach for further research: QFlow lite-a Python-based mini-software suite that uses the dataset to train neural networks to recognize the state of a device and differentiate between states in experimental data.

Title: Cyclofaulknamycin with the Rare Amino Acid D-capreomycidine Isolated from a Well-Characterized Streptomyces albus Strain Abstract: Targeted genome mining is an efficient method of biosynthetic gene cluster prioritization within constantly growing genome databases. Using two capreomycidine biosynthesis genes, alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent arginine beta-hydroxylase and pyridoxal-phosphate-dependent aminotransferase, we identified two types of clusters: one type containing both genes involved in the biosynthesis of the abovementioned moiety, and other clusters including only arginine hydroxylase. Detailed analysis of one of the clusters, the flk cluster from Streptomyces albus, led to the identification of a cyclic peptide that contains a rare D-capreomycidine moiety for the first time. The absence of the pyridoxal-phosphate-dependent aminotransferase gene in the flk cluster is compensated by the XNR_1347 gene in the S. albus genome, whose product is responsible for biosynthesis of the abovementioned nonproteinogenic amino acid. Herein, we report the structure of cyclofaulknamycin and the characteristics of its biosynthetic gene cluster, biosynthesis and bioactivity profile.	1
Title: Studies on new vasodilators, WS-1228 A and B. I. Discovery, taxonomy, isolation and characterization Abstract: New vasodilators, designated WS-1228 A and B have been discovered in the culture filtrate of a strain of Streptomyces aureofaciens. The active compounds were purified by column chromatography with Diaion HP-20 and silica gel, and finally separated from each other by high performance liquid chromatography. They were obtained as pale yellow crystals and their molecular formulae were both C11H17N3O.	0
Title: Auxin-induced changes in the patterns of protein synthesis in soybean hypocotyl Abstract: The patterns of protein synthesis in elongating and mature (basal) sections of soybean hypocotyl were examined after incubation in a medium containing auxin (auxin-treated) or a medium lacking auxin (untreated). The hypocotyl sections (1.2 cm) were labeled with [(35)S]methionine, and polypeptide patterns were analyzed by one- and two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Auxin treatment altered the pattern of protein synthesis in both elongating and basal soybean hypocotyl sections. Excision of terminal segments from incubated sections was required to clearly observe auxin-induced changes in the synthesis of polypeptides. Polypeptides synthesized in terminal segments, possibly in response to wounding, can mask subtle changes in the spectrum of polypeptides synthesized in response to auxin. Cytokinin treatment caused a decrease in [(35)S]methionine incorporation into polypeptides and altered the pattern of protein synthesis in untreated and auxin-treated elongating hypocotyl sections.	0
Title: Characterization of the Biosynthetic Gene Cluster for the Antibiotic Armeniaspirols in Streptomyces armeniacus Abstract: Armeniaspirols (1-3) are potent antibiotics against Gram-positive pathogens. Through a biosynthetic investigation, we identified four enzymes involved in the structural modification of 1-3. Manipulation of their activity led to the generation of 4-6 and nine novel analogues, 7-15. Bioactivity assessments revealed that the pyrrole chloro group and the methyl group are important for the antimicrobial activities of armeniaspirols, which lays the foundation for future structure optimization and mechanism of action studies of armeniaspirols.	1
Title: Identification and characterization of Shiga toxin type 2 variants in Escherichia coli isolates from animals, food, and humans Abstract: There is considerable heterogeneity among the Shiga toxin type 2 (Stx2) toxins elaborated by Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC). One such Stx2 variant, the Stx2d mucus-activatable toxin (Stx2dact), is rendered more toxic by the action of elastase present in intestinal mucus, which cleaves the last two amino acids of the A2 portion of the toxin A subunit. We screened 153 STEC isolates from food, animals, and humans for the gene encoding Stx2dact by using a novel one-step PCR procedure. This method targeted the region of stx(2dact) that encodes the elastase recognition site. The presence of stx(2dact) was confirmed by DNA sequencing of the complete toxin genes. Seven STEC isolates from cows (four isolates), meat (two isolates), and a human (one isolate) that carried the putative stx(2dact) gene were identified; all were eae negative, and none was the O157:H7 serotype. Three of the isolates (CVM9322, CVM9557, and CVM9584) also carried stx(1), two (P1332 and P1334) carried stx(1) and stx(2c), and one (CL-15) carried stx(2c). One isolate, P1130, harbored only stx(2dact). The Vero cell cytotoxicities of supernatants from P1130 and stx(1) deletion mutants of CVM9322, CVM9557, and CVM9584 were increased 13- to 30-fold after treatment with porcine elastase. Thus, Stx2dact-producing strains, as detected by our one-step PCR method, can be isolated not only from humans, as previously documented, but also from food and animals. The latter finding has important public health implications based on a recent report from Europe of a link between disease severity and infection with STEC isolates that produce Stx2dact.	0
Title: Functional analyses of cytochrome P450 genes responsible for the early steps of brassicicene C biosynthesis Abstract: We previously revealed that Orf8 and Orf6, which were identified in the brassicicene C biosynthetic gene cluster in Alternaria brassicicola strain ATCC96836, were fusicoccadiene (FD) synthase and 16-O-methyltransferase, respectively. In the present Letter, the early biosynthetic steps after the formation of FD were investigated. Plasmids carrying the FD synthase gene, one (or two) of five cytochrome P450 genes (orf1, orf2, orf5, orf7, and orf11) identified in the cluster and a cytochrome P450 reductase gene cloned from strain ATCC96836 were constructed and introduced into Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Based on the structures of the compounds produced by the transformants, Orf1 is suggested to be an 8beta-hydroxylation enzyme that yields FD 8beta-ol (4), followed by 16-hydroxylation by Orf7 to produce FD 8beta16-diol (5).	1
Title: Insights into polyether biosynthesis from analysis of the nigericin biosynthetic gene cluster in Streptomyces sp. DSM4137 Abstract: Nigericin was among the first polyether ionophores to be discovered, but its biosynthesis remains obscure. The biosynthetic gene cluster for nigericin has been serendipitously cloned from Streptomyces sp. DSM4137, and deletion of this gene cluster abolished the production of both nigericin and the closely related metabolite abierixin. Detailed comparison of the nigericin biosynthetic genes with their counterparts in the biosynthetic clusters for other polyketides has prompted a significant revision of the proposed common pathway for polyether biosynthesis. In particular, we present evidence that in nigericin, nanchangmycin, and monensin, an unusual ketosynthase-like protein, KSX, transfers the initially formed linear polyketide chain to a discrete acyl carrier protein, ACPX, for oxidative cyclization. Consistent with this, deletion of either monACPX or monKSX from the monensin gene cluster effectively abolished monensin A biosynthesis.	1
Title: Rhodococcus comparative genomics reveals a phylogenomic-dependent non-ribosomal peptide synthetase distribution: insights into biosynthetic gene cluster connection to an orphan metabolite Abstract: Natural products (NPs) are synthesized by biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs), whose genes are involved in producing one or a family of chemically related metabolites. Advances in comparative genomics have been favourable for exploiting huge amounts of data and discovering previously unknown BGCs. Nonetheless, studying distribution patterns of novel BGCs and elucidating the biosynthesis of orphan metabolites remains a challenge. To fill this knowledge gap, our study developed a pipeline for high-quality comparative genomics for the actinomycete genus Rhodococcus, which is metabolically versatile, yet understudied in terms of NPs, leading to a total of 110 genomes, 1891 BGCs and 717 non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs). Phylogenomic inferences showed four major clades retrieved from strains of several ecological habitats. BiG-SCAPE sequence similarity BGC networking revealed 44 unidentified gene cluster families (GCFs) for NRPS, which presented a phylogenomic-dependent evolution pattern, supporting the hypothesis of vertical gene transfer. As a proof of concept, we analysed in-depth one of our marine strains, Rhodococcus sp. H-CA8f, which revealed a unique BGC distribution within its phylogenomic clade, involved in producing a chloramphenicol-related compound. While this BGC is part of the most abundant and widely distributed NRPS GCF, corason analysis unveiled major differences regarding its genetic context, co-occurrence patterns and modularity. This BGC is composed of three sections, two well-conserved right/left arms flanking a very variable middle section, composed of nrps genes. The presence of two non-canonical domains in H-CA8f’s BGC may contribute to adding chemical diversity to this family of NPs. Liquid chromatography-high resolution MS and dereplication efforts retrieved a set of related orphan metabolites, the corynecins, which to our knowledge are reported here for the first time in Rhodococcus. Overall, our data provide insights to connect BGC uniqueness with orphan metabolites, by revealing key comparative genomic features supported by models of BGC distribution along phylogeny.	1
Title: Rapid Discovery of Glycocins through Pathway Refactoring in Escherichia coli Abstract: Glycocins (glycosylated bacteriocins) are a family of ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides with antimicrobial activities against pathogens of interest, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, representing a promising source of new antibiotics. Glycocins are still largely underexplored, and thus far, only six glycocins are known. Here, we used genome mining to identify 50 putative glycocin biosynthetic gene clusters and then chose six of them with distinct features for further investigation. Through two rounds of plug-and-play pathway refactoring and expression in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3), four systems produced novel glycocins. Further structural characterization revealed that one of them, which belongs to the enterocin 96-type glycocins, was diglucosylated on a single serine. The other three compounds belong to the SunA/ThuA-type glycocins and exhibit a antimicrobial spectrum narrower than that of sublancin, the best characterized member in this group, even though they share a similar disulfide topology and glycosylation. Further evaluation of their bioactivities with free glucose at high concentrations suggested that their antimicrobial mechanisms might be both glycocin- and species-specific. These glycocins with distinct features significantly broaden our knowledge and may lead to the discovery of new classes of antibiotics.	1
Title: Enantioselective Tandem Cyclization of Alkyne-Tethered Indoles Using Cooperative Silver(I)/Chiral Phosphoric Acid Catalysis Abstract: Reported is the enantioselective synthesis of tetracyclic indolines using silver(I)/chiral phosphoric acid catalysis. A variety of alkyne-tethered indoles are suitable for this process. Mechanistic studies suggest that the in situ generated silver(I) chiral phosphate activates both the alkyne and the indole nucleophile in the initial cyclization step through an intermolecular hydrogen bond and the phosphate anion promotes proton transfer. In addition, further modifications of the cyclization products enabled stereochemistry-function studies of a series of bioactive indolines.	0
Title: Lateral gene transfer of dissimilatory (bi)sulfite reductase revisited Abstract: In contrast to previous findings, we demonstrate that the dissimilatory (bi)sulfite reductase genes (dsrAB) of Desulfobacula toluolica were vertically inherited. Furthermore, Desulfobacterium anilini and strain mXyS1 were identified, by dsrAB sequencing of 17 reference strains, as members of the donor lineage for those gram-positive Desulfotomaculum species which laterally acquired dsrAB.	0
Title: The Taxus genome provides insights into paclitaxel biosynthesis Abstract: The ancient gymnosperm genus Taxus is the exclusive source of the anticancer drug paclitaxel, yet no reference genome sequences are available for comprehensively elucidating the paclitaxel biosynthesis pathway. We have completed a chromosome-level genome of Taxus chinensis var. mairei with a total length of 10.23 gigabases. Taxus shared an ancestral whole-genome duplication with the coniferophyte lineage and underwent distinct transposon evolution. We discovered a unique physical and functional grouping of CYP725As (cytochrome P450) in the Taxus genome for paclitaxel biosynthesis. We also identified a gene cluster for taxadiene biosynthesis, which was formed mainly by gene duplications. This study will facilitate the elucidation of paclitaxel biosynthesis and unleash the biotechnological potential of Taxus.	1
Title: Putative identification of the usnic acid biosynthetic gene cluster by de novo whole-genome sequencing of a lichen-forming fungus Abstract: To identify the biosynthetic gene cluster responsible for the biosynthesis of the polyketide usnic acid we carried out the de novo genome sequencing of the fungal partner of Cladonia uncialis. This was followed by comprehensive in silico annotation of polyketide synthase (PKS) genes. The biosynthesis of usnic acid requires a non-reducing PKS possessing a carbon methylation (CMeT) domain, a terminal Claisen cyclase (CLC) domain, and an accompanying oxidative enzyme that dimerizes methylphloracetophenone to usnic acid. Of the 32 candidate PKS genes identified in the mycobiont genome, only one was identified as consistent with these biosynthetic requirements. This gene cluster contains two genes encoding a non-reducing PKS and a cytochrome p450, which have been respectively named methylphloracetophenone synthase (MPAS) and methylphloracetophenone oxidase (MPAO). Both mpas and mpao were demonstrated to be transcriptionally active by reverse transcriptase-PCR of the mRNA in a lichen sample that was observed by HPLC to produce usnic acid. Phylogenetic analysis of the bioinformatically identified ketosynthase (KS) and CLC domains of MPAS demonstrated that mpas grouped within a unique clade and that mpas could be used as a phylogenetic probe to identify other MPAS genes.	1
Title: Spiroketal polyketide formation in Sorangium: identification and analysis of the biosynthetic gene cluster for the highly cytotoxic spirangienes Abstract: Natural products constitute important lead structures in drug discovery. In bacteria, they are often synthesized by large, modular multienzyme complexes. Detailed analysis of the biosynthetic machinery should enable its directed engineering and production of desirable analogs. The myxobacterium Sorangium cellulosum So ce90 produces the cytotoxic spiroketal polyketide spirangien, for which we describe the identification and functional analysis of the biosynthetic pathway. The gene cluster spans 88 kb and encodes 7 type I polyketide synthases and additional enzymes such as a stand-alone thioesterase and 2 methyltransferases. Inactivation of two cytochrome P(450) monooxygenase genes resulted in the production of acyclic spirangien derivatives, providing direct evidence for the involvement of these enzymes in spiroketal formation. The presence of large DNA repeats is consistent with multiple rounds of gene duplication during the evolution of the biosynthetic gene locus.	1
Title: Biosynthetic pathway for the epipolythiodioxopiperazine acetylaranotin in Aspergillus terreus revealed by genome-based deletion analysis Abstract: Epipolythiodioxopiperazines (ETPs) are a class of fungal secondary metabolites derived from diketopiperazines. Acetylaranotin belongs to one structural subgroup of ETPs characterized by the presence of a seven-membered 4,5-dihydrooxepine ring. Defining the genes involved in acetylaranotin biosynthesis should provide a means to increase the production of these compounds and facilitate the engineering of second-generation molecules. The filamentous fungus Aspergillus terreus produces acetylaranotin and related natural products. Using targeted gene deletions, we have identified a cluster of nine genes (including one nonribosomal peptide synthetase gene, ataP) that is required for acetylaranotin biosynthesis. Chemical analysis of the wild-type and mutant strains enabled us to isolate 17 natural products from the acetylaranotin biosynthesis pathway. Nine of the compounds identified in this study are natural products that have not been reported previously. Our data have allowed us to propose a biosynthetic pathway for acetylaranotin and related natural products.	1
Title: The Rhizobium meliloti exoK gene and prsD/prsE/exsH genes are components of independent degradative pathways which contribute to production of low-molecular-weight succinoglycan Abstract: When grown on medium supplemented with the succinoglycan-binding dye, Calcofluor, and visualized under UV light, colonies of Rhizobium meliloti (Sinorhizobium meliloti) exoK mutants produce a fluorescent halo with a delayed onset relative to wild-type colonies. By conducting transposon mutagenesis of exoK mutants of R. meliloti and screening for colonies with even more severe delays in production of these fluorescent halos, we identified three genes, designated prsD, prsE, and exsH, which are required for the eventual production of fluorescent halos by exoK colonies. Nucleotide sequence indicates that the prsD and prsE genes encode homologues of ABC transporters and membrane fusion proteins of Type I secretion systems, respectively, whereas exsH encodes a homologue of endo-1,3-1,4-beta-glycanases with glycine-rich nonameric repeats typical of proteins secreted by Type I secretion systems. The exoK gene and the prsD/prsE/exsH genes were shown to be components of independent pathways for production of extracellular succinoglycan degrading activities and for production of low-molecular-weight succinoglycan by R. meliloti. Based on these results, we propose that ExsH is a succinoglycan depolymerase secreted by a Type I secretion system composed of PrsD and PrsE, and that the ExsH and ExoK glycanases contribute to production of low-molecular-weight succinoglycan.	1
Title: NADPH inhibits [2Fe-2S] cluster protein transfer from diabetes drug target MitoNEET to an apo-acceptor protein Abstract: MitoNEET (mNT) is the founding member of the recently discovered CDGSH family of [2Fe-2S] proteins capable of [2Fe-2S] cluster transfer to apo-acceptor proteins. It is a target of the thiazolidinedione (TZD) class of anti-diabetes drugs whose binding modulate both electron transfer and cluster transfer properties. The [2Fe-2S] cluster in mNT is destabilized upon binding of NADPH, which leads to loss of the [2Fe-2S] cluster to the solution environment. Because mNT is capable of transferring [2Fe-2S] clusters to apo-acceptor proteins, we sought to determine whether NADPH binding also affects cluster transfer. We show that NADPH inhibits transfer of the [2Fe-2S] cluster to an apo-acceptor protein with an inhibition constant (K(i)) of 200 μm, which reflects that of NADPH concentrations expected under physiological conditions. In addition, we determined that the strictly conserved cluster interacting residue Asp-84 in the CDGSH domain is necessary for the NADPH-dependent inhibition of [2Fe-2S] cluster transfer. The most critical cellular function of NADPH is in the maintenance of a pool of reducing equivalents, which is essential to counteract oxidative damage. Taken together, our findings suggest that NADPH can regulate both mNT [2Fe-2S] cluster levels in the cell as well as the ability of the protein to transfer [2Fe-2S] clusters to cytosolic or mitochondrial acceptors.	0
Title: Heterologous Expression of Fluostatin Gene Cluster Leads to a Bioactive Heterodimer Abstract: The biosynthesis gene cluster (fls) for atypical angucycline fluostatins was identified from the marine derived Micromonospora rosaria SCSIO N160 and was confirmed by gene knockouts and the biochemical characterization of a bifunctional oxygenase FlsO2. The absolute configuration of the key biosynthetic intermediate prejadomycin was determined for the first time by Cu Kα X-ray analysis. Heterologous expression of the intact fls-gene cluster in Streptomyces coelicolor YF11 in the presence of 3% sea salts led to the isolation of two new compounds: fluostatin L (1) and difluostatin A (2). Difluostatin A (2), an unusual heterodimer, exhibited antibacterial activities.	1
Title: Nanomolar Antimalarial Agents against Chloroquine-Resistant Plasmodium falciparum from Medicinal Plants and Their Structure-Activity Relationships Abstract: Inspired by the discovery of the antimalarial drug artemisinin from a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), a natural product library of 44 lindenane-type sesquiterpenoids was assessed for activities against the Dd2 chloroquine-resistant strain of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum. These compounds were mainly isolated from plants of the Chloranthus genus, many species of which are named "Sikuaiwa" in TCM and have long been used to treat malaria. The compounds consisted of 41 sesquiterpenoid dimers and three monomers, including the 12 new dimers 1-12 isolated from Chloranthus fortunei. The results showed that 16 dimers exhibited potent antiplasmodial activities (<100 nM); in particular, compounds 1, 14, and 19 exhibited low nanomolar activities with IC50 values ranging from 1 to 7 nM, which is comparable to the potency of artemisinin, and selectivity index values toward mammalian cells greater than 500. A comprehensive structure-activity relationship study indicated that three functional groups are essential and two motifs can be modified.	0
Title: Studies on a second and third ring cyclization in anthracycline biosynthesis Abstract: This paper focuses on study of second and third ring cyclization in anthracycline biosynthesis by a heterologous gene expression. Firstly, anthracycline non-producing Streptomyces peucetius mutant, D2 was heterologously complemented to produce daunomycins with plasmids pSgs44 and pSYE66, which contain putative cyclase genes of S. galilaeus and S. nogalater, respectively. A point mutation in the cyclase gene dpsY of D2 has changed glycine to serine resulting inactivation of the enzyme. Secondly, the putative cyclase gene snoaM from S. nogalater, was expressed in a gene cassette in S. lividans TK24 and S. coelicolor CH999 to study the influence of the cyclase gene on auramycinone production and the impact of endogenous genes on production profiles. The results obtained confirms that a cyclase closing the second and third ring of a polyketide is essential in anthracycline biosynthesis.	1
Title: Identification of a gene cluster of biosynthetic genes of rubradirin substructures in S. achromogenes var. rubradiris NRRL3061 Abstract: Rubradirin, an ansamycin antibiotic has been purified from Streptomyces achromogenes var. rubradiris NRRL3061. It consists of four distinct structural moieties, rubransarol, 3-amino-4-hydroxy-coumarin, dihydroxydipicolinic acid, and 2,6-dideoxynitrosugar (DNS). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers were designed based on consensus sequences of dTDP-D-glucose 4,6-dehydratase, one of enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of 2,6-dideoxysugar. A PCR product was obtained from S. achromogenes var. rubradiris. Hybridization of the PCR product to a cosmid library constructed from S. achromogenes genomic DNA has led to the identification of three unlinked regions of DNA. One of three kinds of cosmid clones contains homologues of dTDP-D-glucose 4,6-dehydratase, 3-amino-5-hydroxybenzoic acid (AHBA) synthase, and eryA genes. The size of the gene homologous to eryA is 30 kb, and the AHBA synthase gene homologue resides between the eryA homologous genes. A gene cluster of rubransarol and 2,6-dideoxynitrosugar is around 50 kb. Sequencing of the PCR product from the AHBA synthase gene homologue isolated from S. achromogenes revealed 85% amino acid sequence homology (73/86) with the AHBA synthase from a rifamycin-producer. dTDP-D-glucose 4,6-dehydratase gene homologue was subcloned from one of the isolated cosmid clones and sequenced. It showed 65% homology (43/66) with dTDP-D-glucose 4,6-dehydratase from a streptomycin-producer.	1
Title: Biochemical, structural, and genetic characterization of tridecaptin A₁, an antagonist of Campylobacter jejuni Abstract: Bacillus circulans NRRL B-30644 (now Paenibacillus terrae) was previously reported to produce SRCAM 1580, a bacteriocin active against the food pathogen Campylobacter jejuni. We have been unable to isolate SRCAM 1580, and did not find any genetic determinants in the genome of this strain. We now report the reassignment of this activity to the lipopeptide tridecaptin A₁. Structural characterization of tridecaptin A1 was achieved through NMR, MS/MS and GC-MS studies. The structure was confirmed through the first chemical synthesis of tridecaptin A₁, which also revealed the stereochemistry of the lipid chain. The impact of this stereochemistry on antimicrobial activity was examined. The biosynthetic machinery responsible for tridecaptin production was identified through bioinformatic analyses. P. terrae NRRL B-30644 also produces paenicidin B, a novel lantibiotic active against Gram-positive bacteria. MS/MS analyses indicate that this lantibiotic is structurally similar to paenicidin A.	1
Title: Antibacterial and anticancer activities of orphan biosynthetic gene clusters from Atlantis II Red Sea brine pool Abstract: Background:                       Cancer and infectious diseases are problematic because of continuous emergence of drug resistance. One way to address this enormous global health threat is bioprospecting the unlikeliest environments, such as extreme marine niches, which have tremendous biodiversity that is barely explored. One such environment is the Red Sea brine pool, Atlantis II Deep (ATII). Here, we functionally screened a fosmid library of metagenomic DNA isolated from the ATII lower convective layer (LCL) for antibacterial and anticancer activities.                  Results:                       Selected clones, 14-7E and 10-2G, displayed antibacterial effects on the marine strain Bacillus sp. Cc6. Moreover, whole cell lysates from 14-7E and 10-2G exhibited decreased cell viability against MCF-7 (39.1% ± 6.6, 42% ± 8.1 at 50% v/v) and U2OS cells (35.7% ± 1.9, 79.9% ± 5.9 at 50% v/v), respectively. By sequencing the insert DNA from 14-7E and 10-2G, we identified two putative orphan biosynthetic gene clusters. Both clusters harbored putative ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter permeases and S-adenosylmethionine-related genes. Interestingly, the biosynthetic gene cluster identified on 14-7E is of archaeal origin and harbors a putative transcription factor. Several identified genes may be responsible for the observed antibacterial and anticancer activities. The 14-7E biosynthetic gene cluster may be encoding enzymes producing a specialized metabolite (effect of detected genes involved in C-C bond formation and glycosylation). The bioactivity may also be due to predicted subtilases encoded by this cluster. The 10-2G cluster harbored putative glycosyltransferase and non-ribosomal peptide synthase genes; thus the observed activity of this clone could be caused by a bioactive peptide.                  Conclusions:                       The ATII LCL prokaryotic metagenome hosts putative orphan biosynthetic gene clusters that confer antibiotic and anticancer effects. Further biochemical studies should characterize the detected bioactive components, and the potential use of 14-7E metabolite for antibiosis and 10-2G metabolite as a selective anti-breast cancer drug.	0
Title: Dissemination of an Enterococcus Inc18-Like vanA plasmid associated with vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus Abstract: Of the 9 vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (VRSA) cases reported to date in the literature, 7 occurred in Michigan. In 5 of the 7 Michigan VRSA cases, an Inc18-like vanA plasmid was identified in the VRSA isolate and/or an associated vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) isolate from the same patient. This plasmid may play a critical role in the emergence of VRSA. We studied the geographical distribution of the plasmid by testing 1,641 VRE isolates from three separate collections by PCR for plasmid-specific genes traA, repR, and vanA. Isolates from one collection (phase 2) were recovered from surveillance cultures collected in 17 hospitals in 13 states. All VRE isolates from 2 Michigan institutions (n = 386) and between 60 and 70 VRE isolates (n = 883) from the other hospitals were tested. Fifteen VRE isolates (3.9%) from Michigan were positive for an Inc18-like vanA plasmid (9 E. faecalis [12.5%], 3 E. faecium [1.0%], 2 E. avium, and 1 E. raffinosus). Six VRE isolates (0.6%) from outside Michigan were positive (3 E. faecalis [2.7%] and 3 E. faecium [0.4%]). Of all E. faecalis isolates tested, 6.0% were positive for the plasmid, compared to 0.6% for E. faecium and 3.0% for other spp. Fourteen of the 15 plasmid-positive isolates from Michigan had the same Tn1546 insertion site location as the VRSA-associated Inc18-like plasmid, whereas 5 of 6 plasmid-positive isolates from outside Michigan differed in this characteristic. Most plasmid-positive E. faecalis isolates demonstrated diverse patterns by PFGE, with the exception of three pairs with indistinguishable patterns, suggesting that the plasmid is mobile in nature. Although VRE isolates with the VRSA-associated Inc18-like vanA plasmid were more common in Michigan, they remain rare. Periodic surveillance of VRE isolates for the plasmid may be useful in predicting the occurrence of VRSA.	0
Title: Partial activation of a silent angucycline-type gene cluster from a rubromycin beta producing Streptomyces sp. PGA64 Abstract: In the course of DNA-fingerprinting our strain collection for antibiotic biosynthesis genes, two different type II polyketide synthase (PKS) gene clusters were observed from Streptomyces sp. PGA64. Phylogenetic analysis placed these together with known rubromycin and angucycline biosynthetic gene clusters. The host strain itself has a very clean production profile of secondary metabolites, which composes mainly of rubromycin beta under typical fermentation conditions. Sequencing of a 16.5 kb fragment from the putative angucycline cluster revealed eight genes that were homologous to typical type II PKS genes responsible for synthesizing aromatic polyketides. These genes were especially similar to genes from known angucycline biosynthetic gene clusters and also synteny to these clusters was observed. In addition, three genes were recognized that are needed for priming the minimal PKS complex before polyketide synthesis can initiate, but which are not normally found to cluster with antibiotic biosynthesis genes. A putative repressor gene that was dissimilar to repressor genes found from well-characterized antibiotic biosynthesis gene clusters was also discovered. Gene disruption of the repressor resulted in partial activation of the cluster and production of two angucycline metabolites, UWM6 and rabelomycin. The results confirm that the DNA-fingerprinting method we have developed can be used to correctly detect compounds that are not visible in chemical screens.	1
Title: The kalimantacin/batumin biosynthesis operon encodes a self-resistance isoform of the FabI bacterial target Abstract: BatG is a trans-2-enoyl-ACP reductase, encoded in the kalimantacin/batumin (kal/bat) biosynthesis operon. It is not essential for the production of the kal/bat secondary metabolite. Instead, BatG is an isoform of FabI, conferring full resistance to target bacteria. It also complements FabI in its role in fatty acid biosynthesis. The identification of FabI as the antibacterial target is important to assess clinical potential of the kalimantacin/batumin antibiotics against Staphylococcus aureus.	1
Title: Evaluation of rifamycin SV and rifampin kinetics in lactating ewes Abstract: Serum and milk concentrations of rifamycin SV and rifampin were determined in lactating ewes after a single intravenous injection, and pharmacokinetic parameters were evaluated by the two-compartment open-system model. Rifampin was distributed throughout a greater volume than rifamycin SV and was eliminated more slowly from the body. The concentrations of the two drugs, both lipophilic weak acids, in milk after intravenous or intramuscular injection were lower than in serum, but rifampin was detected in milk sooner and for longer periods than rifamycin SV. Under constant serum drug concentrations, the observed milk/serum ultrafiltrate concentrations ratios (0.19 to 0.29 for rifamycin SV, and 0.90 to 1.28 for rifampin) were close to the calculated ratios derived from the pH-pK passive diffusion concept.	0
Title: Identification of suitable reference genes for real-time PCR analysis of statin-treated human umbilical vein endothelial cells Abstract: Proper data normalization in quantitative real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) is of critical importance for reliable mRNA expression analysis. Due to a diversity in putative reference genes expression stability in different in vitro models, a validation of an internal control gene should be made for each particular tissue or cell type and every specific experimental design. A few approaches have been proposed for reference gene selection, including pair-wise comparison approach and model-based approach. In this article we have assessed the expression stability of eight putative reference genes: ACTB, B2M, GADD45A, GAPDH, HPRT1, PES1, PSMC4, YWHAZ, in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) treated with different statins and with TNF-α. The analysis was performed with three reference gene validation programs: geNorm, NormFinder and BestKeeper. We have shown that hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase 1 gene (HPRT1) and tyrosine 3-monooxygenase/tryptophan 5-monooxygenase activation protein, zeta polypeptide gene (YWHAZ) are the most stably expressed genes among the analyzed ones. Furthermore, our results show that β-actin gene (ACTB) is downregulated by statins and thus should not be used as a normalizing gene in a discussed experimental setup. A ranking of candidate reference genes stability values is provided and might serve as a valuable guide for future gene expression studies in endothelial cells. This is the first report on reference gene selection for RT-qPCR applications in statin-treated HUVEC model.	0
Title: Solution conformation of enopeptin A, a depsipeptide antibiotic, using 2D NMR and restrained molecular dynamics studies Abstract: Studies on the solution conformation of the cyclic depsipeptide antibiotic enopeptin A have been carried out using 2D NMR and molecular modelling techniques. The proton resonances of the antibiotic in DMSO-d6 have been assigned by the use of TOCSY and ROESY experiments. The interproton distance information obtained from the ROESY experiments have been used as the basis for elucidating the probable structures in solution. The restrained molecular dynamics technique was applied to calculate the structures in solution, and six resultant structures with fewer distance constraint violations were obtained that satisfy the experimental restraints very well. The conformation of the cyclic moiety of the molecules is well defined whereas the aliphatic chain segment is disordered.	0
Title: Substrate-induced alterations of high energy phosphate metabolism and contractile function in the perfused heart Abstract: The bioenergetic basis by which the Krebs cycle substrate pyruvate increased cardiac contractile function over that observed with the Embden-Meyerhof substrate glucose was investigated in the isovolumic guinea pig heart. Alterations in the content of the high energy phosphate metabolites and the rate of high energy phosphate turnover were measured by 31P NMR. These were correlated to the changes in contractile function and rates of myocardial oxygen consumption. Maximum left ventricular developed pressure (LVDP) and high energy phosphates were observed with 16 mM glucose or 10 mM pyruvate. In hearts perfused with 16 mM glucose, the intracellular phosphocreatine (PCr) concentration was 15.2 +/- 0.6 mM with a PCr/Pi ratio of 10.3 +/- 0.9. The O2 consumption was 5.35 mumol/g wet weight/min, and these hearts exhibited a LVDP of 97 +/- 3.7 mm Hg at a constant paced rate of 200 beats/min. In contrast, when hearts were switched to 10 mM pyruvate, the PCr concentration was 18.3 +/- 0.4 mM, the PCr/Pi ratio was 30.4 +/- 2.2, the O2 consumption was 6.67 mumol/g wet weight/min, and the LDVP increased to 125 +/- 3.3 mm Hg. From NMR saturation transfer experiments, the steady-state flux of ATP synthesis from PCr was 4.9 mumol/s/g of cell water during glucose perfusion and 6.67 mumol/s/g of cell water during pyruvate perfusion. The flux of ATP synthesis from ADP was measured to be 0.99 mumol/s/g of cell water with glucose and calculated to be 1.33 mumol/s/g of cell water with pyruvate. These results suggest that pyruvate quite favorably alters myocardial metabolism in concert with the increased contractile performance. Thus, as a mechanism to augment myocardial performance, pyruvate appears to be unique.	0
Title: Plasmid deoxyribonucleic acid in Rhizobium trifolii Abstract: In deoxyribonucleic acid of Rhizobium trifolii centrifuged in cesium chloride-ethidium bromide equilibrium was found a sattelite peak containing covalently closed circular deoxyribonucleic acid. The plasmid had a molecular weight of about 64 x 10(6) shown by sedimentation in sucrose gradients and electron microscopy.	0
Title: Gerfelin, a novel inhibitor of geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase from Beauveria felina QN22047. I. Taxonomy, fermentation, isolation, and biological activities Abstract: A new compound, gerfelin, was isolated from a culture broth of Beauveria felina QN22047. It was purified by column chromatography on silica gel and by HPLC. Gerfelin has the molecular formula C15H14O6. It inhibited synthesis of geranylgeranyl diphosphate, which was mediated by recombinant human geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase (hGGPP synthase) in vitro. The inhibitory pattern of gerfelin was noncompetitive against isopentenyl diphosphate, and uncompetitive against farnesyl diphosphate.	0
Title: Lessons in Organic Fluorescent Probe Discovery Abstract: Fluorescent probes have gained profound use in biotechnology, drug discovery, medical diagnostics, molecular and cell biology. The development of methods for the translation of fluorophores into fluorescent probes continues to be a robust field for medicinal chemists and chemical biologists, alike. Access to new experimental designs has enabled molecular diversification and led to the identification of new approaches to probe discovery. This review provides a synopsis of the recent lessons in modern fluorescent probe discovery.	0
Title: Scalarane-based sesterterpenoid RCE-protease inhibitors isolated from the Indonesian marine sponge Carteriospongia foliascens Abstract: Two new 20,24-bishomo-25-norscalaranes, compounds 1 and 2, and two new and two known 20,24-bishomoscalaranes, compounds 3-6, have been isolated from the Indonesian marine sponge Carteriospongia foliascens. The structures of 1-6 were determined by spectroscopic analysis. Compounds 1 and 3-6 inhibit RCE-protease activity.	0
Title: The enduracidin biosynthetic gene cluster from Streptomyces fungicidicus Abstract: The biosynthetic gene cluster for the 17 aa peptide antibiotic enduracidin has been cloned and sequenced from Streptomyces fungicidicus ATCC 21013. The 84 kb gene cluster contains 25 ORFs and is located within a 116 kb genetic locus that was fully sequenced. Targeted disruption of non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) genes in the cluster abolished enduracidin production and confirmed function. The cluster includes four genes, endA-D, encoding two-, seven-, eight- and one-module NRPSs, respectively, and includes unique modules for the incorporation of citrulline and enduracididine. The NRPS organization generally follows the collinearity principle, and starts with a condensation domain (C domain) similar to those found in other lipopeptide systems for the coupling of an acyl group to the starting amino acid. The sixth module of EndB, corresponding to Thr(8), is missing an adenylation domain (A domain) and this module is presumed to be loaded in trans by the single module protein EndD. The most striking feature of the NRPS organization is the lack of epimerization domains (E domains) in light of the fact that the product has seven d-amino acid residues. Sequence analysis reveals that C domains following modules corresponding to d-amino acids belong to a unique subset of C domains able to catalyse both epimerization and condensation reactions. Other genes directing lipid modification and activation, and formation of the non-proteinogenic amino acids 4-hydroxyphenylglycine and enduracididine are readily identified, as are genes possibly involved in regulation of antibiotic biosynthesis and export. These findings provide the basis to further genetically manipulate and improve lipodepsipeptide antibiotics via combinatorial and chemical methods.	1
Title: Development of Autologous C5 Vaccine Nanoparticles to Reduce Intravascular Hemolysis in Vivo Abstract: The complement system is emerging as a new target for treating many diseases. For example, Eculizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody against complement component 5 (C5), has been approved for paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) in which patient erythrocytes are lysed by complement. In this study, we developed vaccines to elicit autologous anti-C5 antibody production in mice for complement inhibition. Immunization of mice with a conservative C5 xenoprotein raised high titers of IgG's against the xenogenous C5, but these antibodies did not reduce C5 activity in the blood. In contrast, an autologous mouse C5 vaccine containing multiple predicted epitopes together with a tolerance-breaking peptide was found to induce anti-C5 autoantibody production in vivo, resulting in decreased hemolytic activity in the blood. We further validated a peptide epitope within this C5 vaccine and created recombinant virus-like particles (VLPs) displaying this epitope fused with the tolerance breaking peptide. Immunizing mice with these novel nanoparticles elicited strong humoral responses against recombinant mouse C5, reduced hemolytic activity, and protected the mice from complement-mediated intravascular hemolysis in a model of PNH. This proof-of-concept study demonstrated that autologous C5-based vaccines could be an effective alternative or supplement for treating complement-mediated diseases such as PNH.	0
Title: ngl9: a third MADS box gene expressed in alfalfa root nodules Abstract: Expression of MADS box genes has previously been localized to the infected cells of alfalfa (Medicago sativa) root nodules. These genes represent the first putative transcription factors to be identified in nodules and are hypothesized to be involved in a signal transduction pathway initiated by the intracellular bacterium. The eventual activation of specific target genes defines pertinent characteristics of this nitrogen-fixing differentiated cell. In this study, we identify a third nodule MADS box gene, ngl9, and demonstrate that the DNA-binding activity of its protein product is dependent on the presence of a second MADS box protein, NMH7. Despite previous results to the contrary, both genes are expressed in the early stages of flower development, further strengthening the premise that nodule developmental programming may capitalize upon existing developmental cascades.	0
Title: Biosynthesis of cervimycin C, an aromatic polyketide antibiotic bearing an unusual dimethylmalonyl moiety Abstract: Cervimycin C is the major component of an antibiotic complex produced by Streptomyces tendae HKI-179 consisting of a tetracycline-type aglycon, six tridesoxysugars and a rare dimethylmalonyl moiety. The biosynthetic origin of cervimycin was studied by molecular studies and feeding experiments, which reveal that the dimethylmalonate unit is not derived from malonate, but from valine.	1
Title: Hit-Validation Methodologies for Ligands Isolated from DNA-Encoded Chemical Libraries Abstract: DNA-encoded chemical libraries (DECLs) are large collections of compounds linked to DNA fragments, serving as amplifiable barcodes, which can be screened on target proteins of interest. In typical DECL selections, preferential binders are identified by high-throughput DNA sequencing, by comparing their frequency before and after the affinity capture step. Hits identified in this procedure need to be confirmed, by resynthesis and by performing affinity measurements. In this article we present new methods based on hybridization of oligonucleotide conjugates with fluorescently labeled complementary oligonucleotides; these facilitate the determination of affinity constants and kinetic dissociation constants. The experimental procedures were demonstrated with acetazolamide, a binder to carbonic anhydrase IX with a dissociation constant in the nanomolar range. The detection of binding events was compatible not only with fluorescence polarization methodologies, but also with Alphascreen technology and with microscale thermophoresis.	0
Title: Pioneer factors and their in vitro identification methods Abstract: Pioneer transcription factors are a special group of transcription factors that can interact with nucleosomal DNA and initiate regulatory events. Their binding to regulatory regions is the first event in gene activation and can occur in silent or heterochromatin regions. Several research groups have endeavored to define pioneer factors and study their binding characteristics using various techniques. In this review, we describe the in vitro methods used to define and characterize pioneer factors, paying particular attention to differences in methodologies and how these differences can affect results.	0
Title: Constitutive and induced functions of the p53 gene Abstract: The p53 tumor suppressor serves to secure genetic stability of multicellular organisms. It suppresses the accumulation of mutations in somatic cells and substantially decreases the probability of malignant diseases. The p53 gene acts highly selectively through multiple mechanisms. Under relatively favorable conditions, p53 helps to maintain intracellular homeostasis by balancing anabolic and catabolic processes and by timely elimination of reactive oxygen species. These functions of p53 facilitate maximal efficiency and survival of cells under conditions of physiological stresses. In the case of grave molecular damage caused by severe stress, a significant amount of highly active p53 is induced leading to irreversible growth arrest and programmed cell death. The induced functions of p53 secure the timely elimination from the organism of damaged and potentially dangerous cells. Collectively, the functions of p53 contribute to the prevention of malignant and other diseases and decelerate the aging process.	0
Title: Serine/threonine kinase PpkA coordinates the interplay between T6SS2 activation and quorum sensing in the marine pathogen Vibrio alginolyticus Abstract: Type VI secretion systems (T6SS) are multiprotein secretion machines that can mediate killing of bacterial cells and thereby modify the composition of bacterial communities. The mechanisms that control the production of and secretion of these killing machines are incompletely understood, although quorum sensing (QS) and the PpkA kinase modulate T6SS activity in some organisms. Here we investigated control the T6S in the marine organism Vibrio alginolyticus EPGS, which encodes two T6SS systems (T6SS1 and T6SS2). We found that the organism principally relies on T6SS2 for interbacterial competition. We further carried out a phosphoproteomic screen to identify substrates of the T6SS2-linked PpkA2 kinase. Substrates of PpkA2 encoded within the T6SS2 cluster as well proteins that are apparently not linked to T6SS-related processes were identified. Similar to other organisms, PpkA2 autophosphorylation was critical for T6SS2 function. Notably, phosphorylation of a polypeptide encoded outside of the T6SS2 cluster, VtsR, was critical for T6SS2 expression and function because it augments the expression of luxR, a key regulator of QS that also promotes T6SS2 gene expression. Thus, PpkA2 controls a phosphorylation cascade that mediates a positive regulatory loop entwining T6SS and QS, thereby coordinating these pathways to enhance the competitive fitness of V. alginolyticus.	0
Title: Genes coding for hepatotoxic heptapeptides (microcystins) in the cyanobacterium Anabaena strain 90 Abstract: The cluster of microcystin synthetase genes from Anabaena strain 90 was sequenced and characterized. The total size of the region is 55.4 kb, and the genes are organized in three putative operons. The first operon (mcyA-mcyB-mcyC) is transcribed in the opposite direction from the second operon (mcyG-mcyD-mcyJ-mcyE-mcyF-mcyI) and the third operon (mcyH). The genes mcyA, mcyB, and mcyC encode nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPS), while mcyD codes for a polyketide synthase (PKS), and mcyG and mcyE are mixed NRPS-PKS genes. The genes mcyJ, mcyF, and mcyI are similar to genes coding for a methyltransferase, an aspartate racemase, and a D-3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase, respectively. The region in the first module of mcyB coding for the adenylation domain was found to be 96% identical with the corresponding part of mcyC, suggesting a recent duplication of this fragment and a replacement in mcyB. In Anabaena strain 90, the order of the domains encoded by the genes in the two sets (from mcyG to mcyI and from mcyA to mcyC) is colinear with the hypothetical order of the enzymatic reactions for microcystin biosynthesis. The order of the microcystin synthetase genes in Anabaena strain 90 differs from the arrangement found in two other cyanobacterial species, Microcystis aeruginosa and Planktothrix agardhii. The average sequence match between the microcystin synthetase genes of Anabaena strain 90 and the corresponding genes of the other species is 74%. The identity of the individual proteins varies from 67 to 81%. The genes of microcystin biosynthesis from three major producers of this toxin are now known. This makes it possible to design probes and primers to identify the toxin producers in the environment.	1
Title: Single-molecule studies reveal a hidden key step in the activation mechanism of membrane-bound protein kinase C-α Abstract: Protein kinase C-α (PKCα) is a member of the conventional family of protein kinase C isoforms (cPKCs) that regulate diverse cellular signaling pathways, share a common activation mechanism, and are linked to multiple pathologies. The cPKC domain structure is modular, consisting of an N-terminal pseudosubstrate peptide, two inhibitory domains (C1A and C1B), a targeting domain (C2), and a kinase domain. Mature, cytoplasmic cPKCs are inactive until they are switched on by a multistep activation reaction that occurs largely on the plasma membrane surface. Often, this activation begins with a cytoplasmic Ca(2+) signal that triggers C2 domain targeting to the plasma membrane where it binds phosphatidylserine (PS) and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2). Subsequently, the appearance of the signaling lipid diacylglycerol (DAG) activates the membrane-bound enzyme by recruiting the inhibitory pseudosubstrate and one or both C1 domains away from the kinase domain. To further investigate this mechanism, this study has utilized single-molecule total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM) to quantitate the binding and lateral diffusion of full-length PKCα and fragments missing specific domain(s) on supported lipid bilayers. Lipid binding events, and events during which additional protein is inserted into the bilayer, were detected by their effects on the equilibrium bound particle density and the two-dimensional diffusion rate. In addition to the previously proposed activation steps, the findings reveal a major, undescribed, kinase-inactive intermediate. On bilayers containing PS or PS and PIP2, full-length PKCα first docks to the membrane via its C2 domain, and then its C1A domain embeds itself in the bilayer even before DAG appears. The resulting pre-DAG intermediate with membrane-bound C1A and C2 domains is the predominant state of PKCα while it awaits the DAG signal. The newly detected, membrane-embedded C1A domain of this pre-DAG intermediate confers multiple useful features, including enhanced membrane affinity and longer bound state lifetime. The findings also identify the key molecular step in kinase activation: because C1A is already membrane-embedded in the kinase off state, recruitment of C1B to the bilayer by DAG or phorbol ester is the key regulatory event that stabilizes the kinase on state. More broadly, this study illustrates the power of single-molecule methods in elucidating the activation mechanisms and hidden regulatory states of membrane-bound signaling proteins.	0
Title: Identification of a DNA transformation gene required for com101A+ expression and supertransformer phenotype in Haemophilus influenzae Abstract: DNA sequencing, RNA mapping, and protein expression experiments revealed the presence of a gene, tfoX+, encoding a 24.9-kDa polypeptide, that is transcribed divergently from a common promoter region with the Haemophilus influenzae rec-1+ gene. H. influenzae strains mutant for tfoX failed to bind transforming DNA and were transformation deficient. Primer extension experiments utilizing in vivo total RNA from precompetent and competent H. influenzae cells demonstrated that transcription of tfoX+ increased immediately upon competence induction, suggesting that tfoX+ is an early competence gene. Similar experiments showed that the expression of the late competence-specific gene, com101A+, was tfoX+ dependent. Moreover, expression of plasmid-borne tfoX+ in H. influenzae resulted in constitutive competence. The addition of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) to strains carrying a tfoX::lacZ operon fusion resulted in an immediate increase in beta-galactosidase activity that correlated with an increase in genetic transformability. Collectively, our results suggest that TfoX may play a key role in the development of genetic competence by regulating the expression of late competence-specific genes.	0
Title: Development of a double monoclonal antibody-based sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for detecting canine distemper virus Abstract: Canine distemper virus (CDV) infection causes mass mortality in diverse carnivore species. For effective virus surveillance, rapid and sensitive assays are needed to detect CDV in field samples. In this study, after BABL/c mice were immunized with recombinant CDV-fusion (F) protein, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against recombinant CDV-F protein (designated 1A5, 1A6, and 7D5) were produced using traditional hybridoma cell technology. Next, capture antibody (1A6, 800 ng/well) and horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated detection antibody (HRP-7D5, 1:100, 500 ng/well) were used in a double monoclonal antibody-based sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for CDV detection after optimization of both mAb amounts per well using a checkerboard titration test. Based on sandwich ELISA test results for 120 known CDV-negative samples, the cutoff value for a positive result was set to an OD450 nm value ≥ 0.196. As compared with test results obtained from commercial immune colloidal gold test strips, the low limits of detection for the two assays were revealed to be 100 TCID50 per 100 μL. In addition, the sandwich ELISA agreed 100% and 96.4% with commercial immune colloidal gold test strips when testing serum and stool samples. The sandwich ELISA assay provided statistically similar CDV detection. Thus, the sandwich ELISA developed here to detect CDV in fecal and serum samples provided good sensitivity, high specificity, and good reproducibility and should serve as an ideal method for large-scale surveillance of CDV infections in carnivores. KEY POINTS: • Three CDV mAbs that recognized different epitopes and bound to virion were generated. • The sandwich ELISA based mAbs to detect CDV in fecal and serum samples was developed. • The sandwich ELISA is an ideal method for detecting CDV infections in the field.	0
Title: Bacterial Genome Mining of Enzymatic Tools for Alkyne Biosynthesis Abstract: The alkyne is an important functionality widely used in material science, pharmaceutical science, and chemical biology, but the importance of this functionality is contrasted by the very limited number of enzymes known to be involved in alkyne biosynthesis. We recently reported the first known carrier protein-dependent pathway for terminal alkyne formation, and in silico analysis suggested that this mechanism could be widespread in bacteria. In this paper, we screened additional homologous gene cassettes presumed to be involved in alkyne biosynthesis using both in vitro biochemical study and an E. coli-polyketide synthase (PKS) reporting system for in vivo analysis. We discovered and characterized a new terminal alkyne biosynthetic pathway comprised of TtuA, -B, and -C from Teredinibacter turnerae T7901. While the acyl-CoA ligase homologue (TtuA) demonstrated promiscuity in the activation and loading of medium-chain fatty acids onto the carrier protein (TtuC), the desaturase homologue (TtuB) showed stringent substrate specificity toward C10 fatty acyl moieties. In addition, TtuB was demonstrated to be a bifunctional desaturase/acetylenase that efficiently catalyzed two sequential O2-dependent dehydrogenation reactions. A novel terminal-alkyne bearing polyketide was further produced upon coexpression of ttuABC and a PKS gene in E. coli. The discovery and characterization of TtuA, -B, and -C provides us with a new bifunctional desaturase/acetylenase for mechanistic and structural study and expands the scarce enzyme inventory for the biosynthesis of the alkyne functionality, which has important applications in synthetic and chemical biology.	0
Title: Biosynthetic pathway for mannopeptimycins, lipoglycopeptide antibiotics active against drug-resistant gram-positive pathogens Abstract: The mannopeptimycins are a novel class of lipoglycopeptide antibiotics active against multidrug-resistant pathogens with potential as clinically useful antibacterials. This report is the first to describe the biosynthesis of this novel class of mannosylated lipoglycopeptides. Included here are the cloning, sequencing, annotation, and manipulation of the mannopeptimycin biosynthetic gene cluster from Streptomyces hygroscopicus NRRL 30439. Encoded by genes within the mannopeptimycin biosynthetic gene cluster are enzymes responsible for the generation of the hexapeptide core (nonribosomal peptide synthetases [NRPS]) and tailoring reactions (mannosylation, isovalerylation, hydroxylation, and methylation). The NRPS system is noncanonical in that it has six modules utilizing only five amino acid-specific adenylation domains and it lacks a prototypical NRPS macrocyclizing thioesterase domain. Analysis of the mannopeptimycin gene cluster and its engineering has elucidated the mannopeptimycin biosynthetic pathway and provides the framework to make new and improved mannopeptimycins biosynthetically.	1
Title: Integrity of nonviral fragments in recombinant Tomato bushy stunt virus and defective interfering RNA is influenced by silencing and the type of inserts Abstract: Recombinant plant viruses have the propensity to remove foreign inserts during replication. This process is virus-specific and occurs in a host-dependent manner. In the present study, we investigated the integrity of foreign inserts in recombinant plant viruses using a model system consisting of Tomato bushy stunt virus (TBSV) and its defective interfering RNA (DI). These were tested in Nicotiana benthamiana plants that were either wild type or transgenic for the green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene. GFP-derived inserts were retained in the recombinant TBSV and DI population that were inoculated onto GFP-transgenic N. benthamiana plants in which silencing of the GFP transgene was initiated, but they were removed from the virus and DIs that were maintained on wild-type plants. A foreign insert derived from an endogenous N. benthamiana gene encoding the H subunit of the magnesium chelatase (NbChlH) was deleted, whereas the fragment of an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene (NbRdRP1m) was retained in the recombinant TBSV population. These results demonstrate that the recombination of TBSV to remove nonviral fragments is influenced by silencing and the type of inserts.	0
Title: Spectral homogeneity of human platelets investigated by SERS Abstract: This paper describes a detailed study of the spectral homogeneity of human platelets using Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS). We used a combined approach based on multivariate methods as principal component analysis and pair correlation algorithms to investigate platelets spectral properties. The correlation coefficients for each sample have been calculated, and the average coefficient of determination has been estimated. The high degree of spectral homogeneity inside one probe and between them has been revealed. The prospects of obtained results usage for pathologies based on platelet conformations during cardiovascular diseases have been demonstrated.	0
Title: Paenilamicin: structure and biosynthesis of a hybrid nonribosomal peptide/polyketide antibiotic from the bee pathogen Paenibacillus larvae Abstract: The spore-forming bacterium Paenibacillus larvae is the causative agent of American Foulbrood (AFB), a fatal disease of honey bees that occurs worldwide. Previously, we identified a complex hybrid nonribosomal peptide/polyketide synthesis (NRPS/PKS) gene cluster in the genome of P. larvae. Herein, we present the isolation and structure elucidation of the antibacterial and antifungal products of this gene cluster, termed paenilamicins. The unique structures of the paenilamicins give deep insight into the underlying complex hybrid NRPS/PKS biosynthetic machinery. Bee larval co-infection assays reveal that the paenilamicins are employed by P. larvae in fighting ecological niche competitors and are not directly involved in killing the bee larvae. Their antibacterial and antifungal activities qualify the paenilamicins as attractive candidates for drug development.	1
Title: The identification of cutin synthase: formation of the plant polyester cutin Abstract: A hydrophobic cuticle consisting of waxes and the polyester cutin covers the aerial epidermis of all land plants, providing essential protection from desiccation and other stresses. We have determined the enzymatic basis of cutin polymerization through characterization of a tomato extracellular acyltransferase, CD1, and its substrate, 2-mono(10,16-dihydroxyhexadecanoyl)glycerol. CD1 has in vitro polyester synthesis activity and is required for cutin accumulation in vivo, indicating that it is a cutin synthase.	0
Title: An IgE receptor mimetic peptide (PepE) protects mice from IgE mediated anaphylaxis Abstract: Crosslinking of receptor-bound Immunoglobulin E (IgE) triggers immediate hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis. Blocking the interaction of IgE with its high-affinity receptor, FcεRI, on mast cells and basophils is an attractive strategy for the treatment of allergies. This approach has seen clinical success using the anti-IgE monoclonal antibody, omalizumab. We recently designed and characterized a novel FcεRI-mimetic peptide (PepE) which contains the two key FcεRI α-chain receptor loops known to interact with the ε-heavy chain of IgE, C'-E and B-C, with an optimized linker for joining them. PepE has high specificity and affinity for IgE, blocks IgE binding to FcεRI and prevents IgE-induced mediator release from RBL2H3 cells. We have now investigated the biological effects of this peptide in vivo using a line of mice (BALB/c Il4raF709) very sensitive to IgE-mediated systemic anaphylaxis. IgE-deficient (IgE-/-) Il4raF709 mice were passively sensitized with the anti-DNP IgE monoclonal antibody (SPE-7) and subsequently challenged i.v. with DNP-BSA. Mice receiving a single dose of PepE prior to sensitization with SPE-7 IgE were fully protected from anaphylaxis while vehicle control-treated mice displayed strong reactions with significant core body temperature drops and elevated levels of mouse mast cell protease-1 (mMCP-1) in the serum. However, PepE had no effect on IgE-mediated anaphylaxis if given after IgE administration in IgE-/- mice, suggesting that PepE can block binding of free IgE to FcεRI but cannot compete with the receptor for already bound IgE in vivo. A single dose of PepE treatment did not protect IgE sufficient mice from IgE mediated anaphylaxis. However, a 3 week long course of PepE treatment protected IgE sufficient Il4raF709 mice from body temperature drops and elevation of serum mMCP-1. Our findings establish the potential of this type of structure for blocking IgE binding to mast cells in vivo and suggest that related peptides might have the potential to attenuate clinical allergic reactions.	0
Title: Structure determination of a siderophore peucechelin from Streptomyces peucetius Abstract: Previously, Park et al. isolated a new siderophore from Streptomyces peucetius ATCC 27952 based on information of the genome sequence and the structure of the siderophore was deduced to be a cyclic peptide based on MS/MS analysis. To clarify the structure of the siderophore, we cultured S. peucetius with iron deficient medium. Through several chromatographic procedures, the siderophore named peucechelin was isolated with the yield enough to perform NMR experiments. The planar structure of peucechelin was elucidated by the combination of ESI-MS experiment and NMR spectroscopic analyses of the gallium (III) complex. Unlike the previously deduced cyclic structure, the structure was determined to be a linear peptide which was similar to a known siderophore foroxymithine. The stereochemistries of amino acids constituting peucechelin were determined by applying modified Marfey method to the hydrolysate. Since the biosynthetic gene of peucechelin was formerly determined by Park et al. the similar genes were searched using genome data of other streptomycetes. As a result, the similar genes were found in the genome data of S. venezuelae and S. purpureus. Isolation and identification of siderophore was performed from the iron deficient culture of S. venezuelae. The siderophore of S. venezuelae was identified to be known compound foroxymithine by analysis ESI-MS and NMR spectra in the similar manner with peucechelin. Production of foroxymithine was also observed in the iron deficient culture of S. purpureus. Based on the genome data, comparison of the biosynthetic genes of structurally related siderophores peucechelin and foroxymithine was accomplished in discussion.	1
Title: Complete genome sequence of the erythromycin-producing bacterium Saccharopolyspora erythraea NRRL23338 Abstract: Saccharopolyspora erythraea is used for the industrial-scale production of the antibiotic erythromycin A, derivatives of which play a vital role in medicine. The sequenced chromosome of this soil bacterium comprises 8,212,805 base pairs, predicted to encode 7,264 genes. It is circular, like those of the pathogenic actinomycetes Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Corynebacterium diphtheriae, but unlike the linear chromosomes of the model actinomycete Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) and the closely related Streptomyces avermitilis. The S. erythraea genome contains at least 25 gene clusters for production of known or predicted secondary metabolites, at least 72 genes predicted to confer resistance to a range of common antibiotic classes and many sets of duplicated genes to support its saprophytic lifestyle. The availability of the genome sequence of S. erythraea will improve insight into its biology and facilitate rational development of strains to generate high-titer producers of clinically important antibiotics.	1
Title: Isolation and mapping of plasmids containing the Salmonella typhimurium origin of DNA replication Abstract: A purified EcoRI restriction endonuclease fragment that determines resistance to kanamycin and is incapable of self-replication was used to select autonomously replicating fragments from an EcoRI digest of a Salmonella typhimurium F' plasmid containing the chromosomal region believed to include the S. typhimurium origin of DNA replication. Both the F factor and S. typhimurium chromosome replication origins were cloned by this procedure. The EcoRI fragmentment containing the S. typhimurium origin of replication is 19.4 kilobase pairs long and includes functional asp+ and uncB+ genes. Restriction endonuclease analysis of deletions obtained from the S. typhimurium origin plasmid indicated that the replication origin (ori region) is contained within a 3.3-kilobase pair region. Comparison with Escherichia coli origin plasmids shows colinearity of gene arrangement on the chromosomes in this region and suggests that some, but not all, regions of the nucleotide sequence in the origin region may be conserved (identical) in these two bacterial species.	0
Title: Organisation and functions of the actVA region of the actinorhodin biosynthetic gene cluster of Streptomyces coelicolor Abstract: Sequence analysis of the actVA region of the actinorhodin biosynthetic gene cluster of Streptomyces coelicolor revealed a succession of six open reading frames (ORFs), all running in the same direction and extending over 5.32 kb. The protein product of actVA-ORF1 strongly resembles that of another gene, elsewhere in the act cluster (actII-ORF2), which codes for a trans-membrane protein previously implicated in actinorhodin export from the mycelium. This suggests that the two gene products may co-operate in actinorhodin export, perhaps being sufficient for self-protection of the organism against suicide. At least four of the other five ORFs are implicated in the control of the C-6 and C-8 ring-hydroxylation reactions, lacking in actVA mutants, that occur at middle to late stages in the actinorhodin biosynthetic pathway. This conclusion was reached by genetic mapping of actVA mutants to actVA-ORF3 and -ORF5 (and perhaps -ORF4), and by the finding of strong resemblances between the protein products of actVA-ORF2 and -ORF6 and the products of genes of the oxytetracycline or tetracenomycin gene clusters that have been implicated in ring-hydroxylation reactions in the biosynthesis of these other aromatic polyketide antibiotics.	1
Title: Cloning and nucleotide sequence determination of the isopenicillin N synthetase gene from Streptomyces clavuligerus Abstract: The isopenicillin N synthetase (IPNS) gene from Streptomyces clavuligerus was isolated from an Escherichia coli plasmid library of S. clavuligerus genomic DNA fragments using a 44-mer mixed oligodeoxynucleotide probe. The nucleotide sequence of a 3-kb region of the cloned fragment from the plasmid, pBL1, was determined and analysis of the sequence showed an open reading frame that could encode a protein of 329 amino acids with an Mr of 36,917. When the S. clavuligerus DNA from pBL1 was introduced into an IPNS-deficient mutant of S. clavuligerus on the Streptomyces vector pIJ941, the recombinant plasmid was able to complement the mutation and restore IPNS activity. The protein coding region of the S. clavuligerus IPNS gene shows about 63% and 62% similarity to the Cephalosporium acremonium and Penicillium chrysogenum IPNS nucleotide sequences, respectively, and the predicted amino acid sequence of the encoded protein showed about 56% similarity to both fungal sequences.	1
Title: Purification and Characterization of an Extracellular Acid Proteinase from the Ectomycorrhizal Fungus Hebeloma crustuliniforme Abstract: Hebeloma crustuliniforme produced an extracellular acid proteinase in a liquid medium containing bovine serum albumin as the sole nitrogen source. The proteinase was purified 26-fold with 20% activity recovery and was shown to have a molecular weight of 37,800 (as indicated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis) and an isoelectric point of 4.8 +/- 0.2. The enzyme was most active at 50 degrees C and pH 2.5 against bovine serum albumin and was stable in the absence of substrates at temperatures up to 45 degrees C and pHs between 2.0 and 5.0. Pepstatin A, diazoacetyl-dl-norleucine methylester, metallic ions Fe and Fe, and phenolic acids severely inhibited the enzyme activity, while antipain, leupeptin, N-alpha-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone, and trypsin inhibitor inhibited the activity moderately. The proteinase hydrolyzed bovine serum albumin and cytochrome c rapidly compared with casein and azocasein but failed to hydrolyze any of the low-molecular-weight peptide derivatives tested.	0
Title: Characterization of the Francisella tularensis subsp. novicida type IV pilus Abstract: Francisella tularensis causes the disease tularaemia. Type IV pili (Tfp) genes are present in the genomes of all F. tularensis subspecies. We show that the wild-type F. tularensis subsp. novicida expresses pilus fibres on its surface, and mutations in the Tfp genes pilF and pilT disrupt pilus biogenesis. Mutations in other Tfp genes (pilQ and pilG) do not eliminate pilus expression. A mutation in pilE4 eliminates pilus expression, whereas mutations in the other pilin subunits pilE1-3 and pilE5 do not, suggesting that pilE4 is the major pilus structural subunit. The virulence regulator MglA is required for pilus expression, and it regulates the transcription of a putative Tfp glycosylation gene (FTN0431). However, MglA does not regulate transcription of pilF, pilT or pilE4, and a strain lacking FTN0431 still expresses pili; thus, it is unclear how MglA regulates pilus expression. Only pilF was also required for protein secretion, while pilE4 and pilT were not, indicating that there is very little overlap of the protein secretion/Tfp functions of the pil genes. The protein secretion component pilE1 was more important for in vitro intramacrophage growth and mouse virulence than the Tfp component pilE4. Our results provide the first genetic characterization of the novel Tfp system of F. tularensis.	0
Title: Characterization of microbial communities in gas industry pipelines Abstract: Culture-independent techniques, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis, and random cloning of 16S rRNA gene sequences amplified from community DNA were used to determine the diversity of microbial communities in gas industry pipelines. Samples obtained from natural gas pipelines were used directly for DNA extraction, inoculated into sulfate-reducing bacterium medium, or used to inoculate a reactor that simulated a natural gas pipeline environment. The variable V2-V3 (average size, 384 bp) and V3-V6 (average size, 648 bp) regions of bacterial and archaeal 16S rRNA genes, respectively, were amplified from genomic DNA isolated from nine natural gas pipeline samples and analyzed. A total of 106 bacterial 16S rDNA sequences were derived from DGGE bands, and these formed three major clusters: beta and gamma subdivisions of Proteobacteria and gram-positive bacteria. The most frequently encountered bacterial species was Comamonas denitrificans, which was not previously reported to be associated with microbial communities found in gas pipelines or with microbially influenced corrosion. The 31 archaeal 16S rDNA sequences obtained in this study were all related to those of methanogens and phylogenetically fall into three clusters: order I, Methanobacteriales; order III, Methanomicrobiales; and order IV, Methanosarcinales: Further microbial ecology studies are needed to better understand the relationship among bacterial and archaeal groups and the involvement of these groups in the process of microbially influenced corrosion in order to develop improved ways of monitoring and controlling microbially influenced corrosion.	0
Title: Dissecting glycosylation steps in lobophorin biosynthesis implies an iterative glycosyltransferase Abstract: The identification of a lobophorin biosynthetic gene cluster from the deep-sea derived Streptomyces sp. SCSIO 01127 reveals a paradigm of three glycosyltransferases (GTs) LobG1-LobG3 being responsible for appending four sugars. Characterization of five differentially glycosylated metabolites from three GT gene-inactivation mutants allowed the assignment of GT functions and the implication of LobG3 as an iterative GT to attach two digitoxoses.	1
Title: An N-nitrosating metalloenzyme constructs the pharmacophore of streptozotocin Abstract: Small molecules containing the N-nitroso group, such as the bacterial natural product streptozotocin, are prominent carcinogens1,2 and important cancer chemotherapeutics3,4. Despite the considerable importance of this functional group to human health, enzymes dedicated to the assembly of the N-nitroso unit have not been identified. Here we show that SznF, a metalloenzyme from the biosynthesis of streptozotocin, catalyses an oxidative rearrangement of the guanidine group of Nω-methyl-L-arginine to generate an N-nitrosourea product. Structural characterization and mutagenesis of SznF reveal two separate active sites that promote distinct steps in this transformation using different iron-containing metallocofactors. This biosynthetic reaction, which has little precedent in enzymology or organic synthesis, expands the catalytic capabilities of non-haem-iron-dependent enzymes to include N-N bond formation. We find that biosynthetic gene clusters that encode SznF homologues are widely distributed among bacteria-including environmental organisms, plant symbionts and human pathogens-which suggests an unexpectedly diverse and uncharacterized microbial reservoir of bioactive N-nitroso metabolites.	1
Title: A putative ABC transporter is involved in negative regulation of biofilm formation by Listeria monocytogenes Abstract: Listeria monocytogenes may persist for long periods in food processing environments. In some instances, this may be due to aggregation or biofilm formation. To investigate the mechanism controlling biofilm formation in the food-borne pathogen L. monocytogenes, we characterized LM-49, a mutant with enhanced ability of biofilm formation generated via transposon Tn917 mutagenesis of L. monocytogenes 4b G. In this mutant, a Tn917 insertion has disrupted the coding region of the gene encoding a putative ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter permease identical to Lmof2365_1771 (a putative ABC transporter permease) presented in the sequenced strain L. monocytogenes strain 4b F2365. This disrupted gene, denoted lm.G_1771, encoded a protein with 10 transmembrane helices. The revertant, LM-49RE, was obtained by replacing lm.G_1771::Tn917 with lm.G_1771 via homologous recombination. We found that LM-49RE formed the same amount of biofilm biomass as the wild-type strain. Furthermore, transcription of the downstream lm.G_1770 gene was not influenced by the upstream Tn917 insertion, and the presence of Tn917 has no effect on biofilm formation. These results suggest that lm.G_1771 was solely responsible for the negative regulation of biofilm formation by L. monocytogenes 4b G. The immediate gene upstream of lm.G_1771 encoded an ATP-binding protein. Bioinformatics analysis suggested that these two genes were organized into an operon and that their proteins formed an export ABC transporter. Here, we report the characterization of the mutant and identification of a novel ABC transporter that functions in negative regulation of biofilm formation in L. monocytogenes.	0
Title: Characterization of AusA: a dimodular nonribosomal peptide synthetase responsible for the production of aureusimine pyrazinones Abstract: Aureusimines have been identified as potential virulence factors in Staphylococcus aureus. These pyrazinone secondary metabolites are produced by a nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) annotated as AusA. We report the overproduction of AusA as a 277 kDa soluble protein with A(1)-T(1)-C-A(2)-T(2)-R bimodular architecture. The substrate specificity of each adenylation (A) domain was initially probed using an ATP-pyrophosphate exchange assay with A-domain selective bisubstrate inhibitors to chemically knock out each companion A-domain. The activity of AusA was then reconstituted in vitro and shown to produce all naturally occurring aureusimines and non-natural pyrazinone products with k(cat) values ranging from 0.4 to 1.3 min(-1). Steady-state kinetic parameters were determined for all substrates and cofactors, providing the first comprehensive steady-state characterization of a NRPS employing a product formation assay. The K(M) values for the amino acids were up to 60-fold lower with the product formation assay than with the ATP-pyrophosphate exchange assay, most commonly used to assess A-domain substrate specificity. The C-terminal reductase (R) domain catalyzes reductive release of the dipeptidyl intermediate, leading to formation of an amino aldehyde that cyclizes to a dihydropyrazinone. We show oxidation to the final pyrazinone heterocycle is spontaneous. The activity and specificity of the R-domain was independently investigated using a NADPH consumption assay. AusA is a minimal autonomous two-module NRPS that represents an excellent model system for further kinetic and structural characterization.	1
Title: Expression of Caulobacter dnaA as a function of the cell cycle Abstract: The initiation of DNA replication is under differential control in Caulobacter crescentus. Following cell division, only the chromosome in the progeny stalked cell is able to initiate DNA replication, while the chromosome in the progeny swarmer cell does not replicate until later in the cell cycle. We have isolated the dnaA gene in order to determine whether this essential and ubiquitous replication initiation protein also contributes to differential replication control in C. crescentus. Analysis of the cloned C. crescentus dnaA gene has shown that the deduced amino acid sequence can encode a 486-amino-acid protein that is 37% identical to the DnaA protein of Escherichia coli. The gene is located 2 kb from the origin of replication. Primer extension analysis revealed a single transcript originating from a sigma 70-type promoter. Immunoprecipitation of a DnaA'-beta-lactamase fusion protein showed that although expression occurs throughout the cell cycle, there is a doubling in the rate of expression just prior to the initiation of replication.	0
Title: Stereospecificity of ketoreductase domains 1 and 2 of the tylactone modular polyketide synthase Abstract: Tylactone synthase (TYLS) is a modular polyketide synthase that catalyzes the formation of tylactone (1), the parent aglycone precursor of the macrolide antibiotic tylosin. TYLS modules 1 and 2 are responsible for the generation of antidiketide and triketide intermediates, respectively, each bound to an acyl carrier protein (ACP) domain. Each module harbors a ketoreductase (KR) domain. The stereospecificity of TYLS KR1 and TYLS KR2 has been determined by incubating each of the recombinant ketoreductase domains with reconstituted ketosynthase-acyltransferase [KS][AT] and ACP domains from the 6-deoxyerythronolide B synthase (DEBS) in the presence of the N-acetylcysteamine thioester of syn-(2S,3R)-2-methyl-3-hydroxypentanoate (6), methylmalonyl-CoA, and NADPH resulting in the exclusive formation of the ACP-bound (2R,3R,4S,5R)-2,4-methyl-3,5-dihydroxyhepanoyl triketide, as established by GC-MS analysis of the TMS ether of the derived triketide lactone 7. Both TYLS KR1 and KR2 therefore catalyze the stereospecific reduction of the 2-methyl-3-ketoacyl-ACP substrate from the re-face, with specificity for the reduction of the (2R)-methyl (D) diastereomer. The dehydration that is catalyzed by the dehydratase (DH) domains of TYLS module 2 to give the unsaturated (2E,4S,5R)-2,4-dimethyl-5-hydroxyhept-2-enoyl-ACP2 is therefore a syn elimination of water.	1
Title: Discovery of the lomaiviticin biosynthetic gene cluster in Salinispora pacifica Abstract: The lomaiviticins are a family of cytotoxic marine natural products that have captured the attention of both synthetic and biological chemists due to their intricate molecular scaffolds and potent biological activities. Here we describe the identification of the gene cluster responsible for lomaiviticin biosynthesis in Salinispora pacifica strains DPJ-0016 and DPJ-0019 using a combination of molecular approaches and genome sequencing. The link between the lom gene cluster and lomaiviticin production was confirmed using bacterial genetics, and subsequent analysis and annotation of this cluster revealed the biosynthetic basis for the core polyketide scaffold. Additionally, we have used comparative genomics to identify candidate enzymes for several unusual tailoring events, including diazo formation and oxidative dimerization. These findings will allow further elucidation of the biosynthetic logic of lomaiviticin assembly and provide useful molecular tools for application in biocatalysis and synthetic biology.	1
Title: Biosynthesis of violacein: intact incorporation of the tryptophan molecule on the oxindole side, with intramolecular rearrangement of the indole ring on the 5-hydroxyindole side Abstract: Feeding experiments with a mixture of [2-13C]- and [indole-3-13C]tryptophans, of [3-13C]- and [indole-3-13 C]tryptophans (1:1 molar ratio) and of others have proved that the 1,2-shift of the indole ring occurred via an intramolecular process for formation of the left part (5-hydroxyindole side) of the violacein skeleton and demonstrated that the C-C bond from C2 of the indole ring to C2 of the side chain was completely retained for formation of the right part (oxindole side) during the entire biosynthetic process. Due to the involvement of transaminase, it has remained unresolved whether indolylpyruvic acid is the biosynthetic intermediate and/or from where the nitrogen atom of the pyrrolidone ring originates. An incorporation experiment with a mixture of [2-13C]- and [alpha-15N]tryptophans (1:1 molar ratio) verified that the nitrogen atom in the central ring was exclusively derived from the right-side tryptophan. Thus, all the carbon and nitrogen atoms in the right part of the violacein skeleton were constructed by intact incorporation of the tryptophan molecule, with decarboxylation probably occurring at a later biosynthetic stage.	1
Title: Cationic fullerenes are effective and selective antimicrobial photosensitizers Abstract: Fullerenes are soccer ball-shaped molecules composed of carbon atoms, and, when derivatized with functional groups, they become soluble and can act as photosensitizers. Antimicrobial photodynamic therapy combines a nontoxic photosensitizer with harmless visible light to generate reactive oxygen species that kill microbial cells. We have compared the antimicrobial activity of six functionalized C(60) compounds with one, two, or three hydrophilic or cationic groups in combination with white light against gram-positive bacteria, gram-negative bacteria, and fungi. After a 10 min incubation, the bis- and tris-cationic fullerenes were highly active in killing all tested microbes (4-6 logs) under conditions in which mammalian cells were comparatively unharmed. These compounds performed significantly better than a widely used antimicrobial photosensitizer, toluidine blue O. The high selectivity and efficacy exhibited by these photosensitizers encourage further testing for antimicrobial applications.	0
Title: Synthesis, resolution, and in vitro evaluation of three vesicular acetylcholine transporter ligands and evaluation of the lead fluorine-18 radioligand in a nonhuman primate Abstract: The vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT) is a reliable biomarker for assessing cholinergic dysfunction associated with dementia. We recently reported three new potent and selective carbon-11 labeled VAChT radiotracers. Herein, we report the resolution with a Chiralcel OD column of three additional fluorine containing VAChT ligands in which a fluoroethoxy or fluoroethylamino moiety was substituted for the methoxy group. An in vitro competitive binding assay showed that (-)-7 had high potency for VAChT (Ki-VAChT = 0.31 ± 0.03 nM) and excellent selectivity for VAChT versus σ receptors (Ki-σ1 = 1870 ± 250 nM, Ki-σ2 = 5480 ± 140 nM). Three different radiolabeling approaches were explored; the radiosynthesis of (-)-[18F]7 was successfully accomplished via a stepwise two-pot, three-step method with moderate yield (11 ± 2%) and high radiochemical purity (>98%). PET imaging studies in a nonhuman primate indicated that (-)-[18F]7 rapidly entered the brain and accumulated in the VAChT-enriched striatum. The uptake of (-)-[18F]7 in the target striatal area peaked at 10 min and displayed improved clearance kinetics compared to the VAChT tracer [18F]VAT, which has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for first-in-man studies. These studies justify further investigation of (-)-[18F]7 and exploration of the structure-activity relationships of these fluoroethoxy and fluoroethylamino analogs.	0
Title: Effects of Koumine on Adjuvant- and Collagen-Induced Arthritis in Rats Abstract: To examine the effect of koumine, a Gelsemium alkaloid, on two experimental models of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), rats with adjuvant-induced arthritis (AIA) and collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) were administered koumine (0.6, 3, or 15 mg/kg/day) or vehicle through gastric gavage (i.g.). Clinical evaluation was performed via measurements of hind paw volume, arthritis index (AI) score, mechanical withdrawal threshold, organ weight, and by radiographic and histological examinations. Levels of interleukin (IL)-1β, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, and antitype II collagen (CII) antibody were also examined. In rats with AIA, koumine reduced the AI score and mechanical allodynia of the injected hind paw in a dose-dependent manner and significantly inhibited increase in thymus and liver weights. In rats with CIA, koumine inhibited increase in hind paw volume, AI score, and mechanical allodynia in a dose-dependent manner and reduced joint space narrowing. Furthermore, koumine also attenuated the increase in the expression of IL-1β and TNF-α, as well as the robust increase of serum anti-CII antibodies in response to immunization. These results suggested that koumine effectively attenuated arthritis progression in two rat models of RA and that this therapeutic effect may be associated with its immunoregulatory action.	0
Title: Synthetic Polymer Hybridization with DNA and RNA Directs Nanoparticle Loading, Silencing Delivery, and Aptamer Function Abstract: We report herein discrete triplex hybridization of DNA and RNA with polyacrylates. Length-monodisperse triazine-derivatized polymers were prepared on gram-scale by reversible addition-fragmentation chain-transfer polymerization. Despite stereoregio backbone heterogeneity, the triazine polymers bind T/U-rich DNA or RNA with nanomolar affinity upon mixing in a 1:1 ratio, as judged by thermal melts, circular dichroism, gel-shift assays, and fluorescence quenching. We call these polyacrylates "bifacial polymer nucleic acids" (bPoNAs). Nucleic acid hybridization with bPoNA enables DNA loading onto polymer nanoparticles, siRNA silencing delivery, and can further serve as an allosteric trigger of RNA aptamer function. Thus, bPoNAs can serve as tools for both non-covalent bioconjugation and structure-function nucleation. It is anticipated that bPoNAs will have utility in both bio- and nanotechnology.	0
Title: Unexpected Diversity and High Abundance of Putative Nitric Oxide Dismutase (Nod) Genes in Contaminated Aquifers and Wastewater Treatment Systems Abstract: It has recently been suggested that oxygenic dismutation of NO into N2 and O2 may occur in the anaerobic methanotrophic "Candidatus Methylomirabilis oxyfera" and the alkane-oxidizing gammaproteobacterium HdN1. It may represent a new pathway in microbial nitrogen cycling catalyzed by a putative NO dismutase (Nod). The formed O2 enables microbes to employ aerobic catabolic pathways in anoxic habitats, suggesting an ecophysiological niche space of substantial appeal for bioremediation and water treatment. However, it is still unknown whether this physiology is limited to "Ca Methylomirabilis oxyfera" and HdN1 and whether it can be coupled to the oxidation of electron donors other than alkanes. Here, we report insights into an unexpected diversity and remarkable abundance of nod genes in natural and engineered water systems. Phylogenetically diverse nod genes were recovered from a range of contaminated aquifers and N-removing wastewater treatment systems. Together with nod genes from "Ca Methylomirabilis oxyfera" and HdN1, the novel environmental nod sequences formed no fewer than 6 well-supported phylogenetic clusters, clearly distinct from canonical NO reductase (quinol-dependent NO reductase [qNor] and cytochrome c-dependent NO reductase [cNor]) genes. The abundance of nod genes in the investigated samples ranged from 1.6 × 107 to 5.2 × 1010 copies · g-1 (wet weight) of sediment or sludge biomass, accounting for up to 10% of total bacterial 16S rRNA gene counts. In essence, NO dismutation could be a much more widespread physiology than currently perceived. Understanding the controls of this emergent microbial capacity could offer new routes for nitrogen elimination or pollutant remediation in natural and engineered water systems.                  Importance:                       NO dismutation into N2 and O2 is a novel process catalyzed by putative NO dismutase (Nod). To date, only two bacteria, the anaerobic methane-oxidizing bacterium "Ca Methylomirabilis oxyfera" and the alkane-oxidizing gammaproteobacterium HdN1, are known to harbor nod genes. In this study, we report efficient molecular tools that can detect and quantify a wide diversity of nod genes in environmental samples. A surprisingly high diversity and abundance of nod genes were found in contaminated aquifers as well as wastewater treatment systems. This evidence indicates that NO dismutation may be a much more widespread physiology in natural and man-made environments than currently perceived. The molecular tools presented here will facilitate further studies on these enigmatic microbes in the future.	0
Title: Soil Type Affects Organic Acid Production and Phosphorus Solubilization Efficiency Mediated by Several Native Fungal Strains from Mexico Abstract: Phosphorus (P) is considered a scarce macronutrient for plants in most tropical soils. The application of rock phosphate (RP) has been used to fertilize crops, but the amount of P released is not always at a necessary level for the plant. An alternative to this problem is the use of Phosphorus Solubilizing Microorganisms (PSM) to release P from chemically unavailable forms. This study compared the P sorption capacity of soils (the ability to retain P, making it unavailable for the plant) and the profile of organic acids (OA) produced by fungal isolates and the in vitro solubilization efficiency of RP. Trichoderma and Aspergillus strains were assessed in media with or without RP and different soils (Andisol, Alfisol, Vertisol). The type and amount of OA and the amount of soluble P were quantified, and according to our data, under the conditions tested, significant differences were observed in the OA profiles and the amount of soluble P present in the different soils. The efficiency to solubilize RP lies in the release of OAs with low acidity constants independent of the concentration at which they are released. It is proposed that the main mechanism of RP dissolution is the production of OAs.	0
Title: Caelestines A-D, brominated quinolinecarboxylic acids from the Australian ascidian Aplidium caelestis Abstract: Four new brominated natural products, caelestines A-D (1-4), have been isolated from the Australian ascidian Aplidium caelestis. The structures of 1-4 were determined by analysis of their NMR and MS data. This is the first report of brominated quinolinecarboxylic acids from nature. Compound 1 has been previously synthesized but not spectroscopically characterized. Compounds 1-4 were tested against three mammalian cell lines (MCF-7, NFF, and MM96L) and a panel of microbial strains and showed only minor cytotoxicity.	0
Title: Methylpyrrole tropane alkaloids from the bark of Erythroxylum vacciniifolium Abstract: Nine new tropane alkaloids substituted by a methylpyrrole moiety were isolated from the bark of Erythroxylum vacciniifolium, a Brazilian endemic plant used in traditional medicine and locally known as catuaba. All compounds were elucidated as tropanediol or -triol alkaloids esterified by at least one 1-methyl-1H-pyrrole-2-carboxylic acid. One of the isolated compounds was identified as a tropane alkaloid N-oxide. Their structures were determined by high-resolution mass spectrometry and multidimensional NMR spectroscopy.	0
Title: An Unusual Protector-Protégé Strategy for the Biosynthesis of Purine Nucleoside Antibiotics Abstract: Pentostatin (PTN, deoxycoformycin) and arabinofuranosyladenine (Ara-A, vidarabine) are purine nucleoside antibiotics used clinically to treat hematological cancers and human DNA virus infections, respectively. PTN has a 1,3-diazepine ring, and Ara-A is an adenosine analog with an intriguing epimerization at the C-2' hydroxyl group. However, the logic underlying the biosynthesis of these interesting molecules has long remained elusive. Here, we report that the biosynthesis of PTN and Ara-A employs an unusual protector-protégé strategy. To our surprise, we determined that a single gene cluster governs PTN and Ara-A biosynthesis via two independent pathways. Moreover, we verified that PenB functions as a reversible oxidoreductase for the final step of PTN. Remarkably, we provided the first direct biochemical evidence that PTN can protect Ara-A from deamination by selective inhibition of the host adenosine deaminase. These findings expand our knowledge of natural product biosynthesis and open the way for target-directed genome mining of Ara-A/PTN-related antibiotics.	1
Title: Characterization of Cichopeptins, New Phytotoxic Cyclic Lipodepsipeptides Produced by Pseudomonas cichorii SF1-54 and Their Role in Bacterial Midrib Rot Disease of Lettuce Abstract: The lettuce midrib rot pathogen Pseudomonas cichorii SF1-54 produces seven bioactive compounds with biosurfactant properties. Two compounds exhibited necrosis-inducing activity on chicory leaves. The structure of the two phytotoxic compounds, named cichopeptin A and B, was tentatively characterized. They are related cyclic lipopeptides composed of an unsaturated C12-fatty acid chain linked to the N-terminus of a 22-amino acid peptide moiety. Cichopeptin B differs from cichopeptin A only in the last C-terminal amino acid residue, which is probably Val instead of Leu/Ile. Based on peptide sequence similarity, cichopeptins are new cyclic lipopeptides related to corpeptin, produced by the tomato pathogen Pseudomonas corrugata. Production of cichopeptin is stimulated by glycine betaine but not by choline, an upstream precursor of glycine betaine. Furthermore, a gene cluster encoding cichopeptin synthethases, cipABCDEF, is responsible for cichopeptin biosynthesis. A cipA-deletion mutant exhibited significantly less virulence and rotten midribs than the parental strain upon spray inoculation on lettuce. However, the parental and mutant strains multiplied in lettuce leaves at a similar rate. These results demonstrate that cichopeptins contribute to virulence of P. cichorii SF1-54 on lettuce.	1
Title: Identification of lysine succinylation as a new post-translational modification Abstract: Of the 20 ribosomally coded amino acid residues, lysine is the most frequently post-translationally modified, which has important functional and regulatory consequences. Here we report the identification and verification of a previously unreported form of protein post-translational modification (PTM): lysine succinylation. The succinyllysine residue was initially identified by mass spectrometry and protein sequence alignment. The identified succinyllysine peptides derived from in vivo proteins were verified by western blot analysis, in vivo labeling with isotopic succinate, MS/MS and HPLC coelution of their synthetic counterparts. We further show that lysine succinylation is evolutionarily conserved and that this PTM responds to different physiological conditions. Our study also implies that succinyl-CoA might be a cofactor for lysine succinylation. Given the apparent high abundance of lysine succinylation and the significant structural changes induced by this PTM, it is expected that lysine succinylation has important cellular functions.	0
Title: Kirromycin, an inhibitor of protein biosynthesis that acts on elongation factor Tu Abstract: Kirromycin, a new inhibitor of protein synthesis, is shown to interfere with the peptide transfer reaction by acting on elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu). All the reactions associated with this elongation factor are affected. Formation of the EF-Tu.GTP complex is strongly stimulated. Peptide bond formation is prevented only when Phe-tRNA(Phe) is bound enzymatically to ribosomes, presumably because GTP hydrolysis associated with enzymatic binding of Phe-tRNA(Phe) is not followed by release of EF-Tu.GDP from the ribosome. This antibiotic also enables EF-Tu to catalyze the binding of Phe-tRNA(Phe) to the poly(U).ribosome complex even in the absence of GTP. EF-Tu activity in the GTPase reaction is dramatically affected by kirromycin: GTP hydrolysis, which normally requires ribosomes and aminoacyl-tRNA, takes place with the elongation factor alone. This GTPase shows the same K(m) for GTP as the one dependent on Phe-tRNA(Phe) and ribosomes in the absence of the antibiotic. Ribosomes and Phe-tRNA(Phe), but not tRNA(Phe) or Ac-Phe-tRNA(Phe), stimulate the kirromycin-induced EF-Tu GTPase. These results indicate that the catalytic center of EF-Tu GTPase that is dependent upon aminoacyl-tRNA and ribosomes is primarily located on the elongation factor. In conclusion, kirromycin can substitute for GTP, aminoacyl-tRNA, or ribosomes in various reactions involving EF-Tu, apparently by affecting the allosteric controls between the sites on the EF-Tu molecule interacting with these components.	1
Title: Plantaricin W from Lactobacillus plantarum belongs to a new family of two-peptide lantibiotics Abstract: Plantaricin W (Plw) is a new two-peptide bacteriocin, from Lactobacillus plantarum, which inhibits a large number of Gram-positive bacteria. The two peptides, Plwalpha (comprising 29 residues) and Plwbeta (comprising 32 residues), were isolated from the culture supernatants and characterized. The individual peptides had low antimicrobial activity but acted synergistically, and synergism was seen at all mixing ratios tested. The data indicate that the two peptides work in a 1:1 ratio. Chemical analyses showed that both peptides are lantibiotics, but two unmodified cysteines and one serine residue were present in Plwalpha, and Plwbeta contained one cysteine residue. The Plw structural genes were sequenced and shown to encode prepeptides with sequence similarities to two other two-peptide lantibiotics, namely staphylococcin C55 and lacticin 3147. The conserved residues are mainly serines, threonines and cysteines that can be involved in intramolecular thioether bond formation in the C-terminal parts of the molecules. This indicates that these bacteriocins are members of a new family of lantibiotics with common bridging patterns, and that the ring structures play an important functional role. Based on the data a structural model is presented in which each peptide has a central lanthionine and two overlapping thioether bridges close to their C-termini.	1
Title: Presence of copalyl diphosphate synthase gene in an actinomycete possessing the mevalonate pathway Abstract: We have previously shown that gene clusters for biosyntheses of terpentecin and BE-40644, a diterpene antibiotic and a sesquiterpene antibiotic, respectively, were located in the adjacent mevalonate pathway gene clusters. In this study, a mevalonate pathway gene cluster was cloned from Streptomyces sp. strain KO-3988, which was known to produce furaquinocin A, employing a hybridization experiment using a 3-hydroxy-3-methyl glutaryl CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase gene, which had been previously cloned from the strain KO-3988, as a probe. By sequencing flanking regions, we found four open reading frames that could encode a putative cytochrome P450 (ORF1), an isoprenoid cyclase (ORF2), an unknown protein (ORF3), and a polyprenyl diphosphate synthase gene (ORF4) in the upstream region of the mevalonate pathway gene cluster, though we did not find any genes related to furaquinocin A biosynthesis. The two ORFs (ORF2 and 4) were expressed as recombinant enzymes in E. coli and used for studies to investigate functions of these products. The ORF4 product was confirmed to be a geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGDP, C20) synthase. The ORF2 product proved to catalyze a conversion of GGDP into copalyl diphosphate, the first example of an enzyme with this function of prokaryotic origin. These results again showed that actinomycetes possessing the mevalonate pathway usually produce an isoprenoid and that its biosynthetic gene cluster exists in adjacent the mevalonate pathway gene cluster.	1
Title: Armeniaspirol Antibiotic Biosynthesis: Chlorination and Oxidative Dechlorination Steps Affording Spiro[4.4]non-8-ene Abstract: Armeniaspirols are potent antibiotics containing an unusual spiro[4.4]non-8-ene moiety. Herein, we describe the cloning and functional analysis of the armeniaspirol biosynthetic gene cluster. Gene-inactivation studies and subsequent isolation of previously unknown biosynthetic intermediates shed light on intriguing biosynthetic details. Remarkably, deletion of ams15, which encodes a protein bearing a flavin-binding domain, led to the accumulation of several non-spiro intermediates with various numbers of chlorine substitutions on the pyrrole moiety. The di- and trichloropyrrole species were converted by Streptomyces albus expressing Ams15 into mono- and dichlorinated spiro derivatives, respectively. In addition, in vitro conversion of these non-spiro intermediates into des-N-methyl spiro intermediates by the cell lysate of the same recombinant strain proved Ams15 to be responsible for spiro formation through oxidative dehalogenation.	1
Title: Structure and functional analysis of a marine bacterial carotenoid biosynthesis gene cluster and astaxanthin biosynthetic pathway proposed at the gene level Abstract: A carotenoid biosynthesis gene cluster for the production of astaxanthin was isolated from the marine bacterium Agrobacterium aurantiacum. This cluster contained five carotenogenic genes with the same orientation, which were designated crtW, crtZ, crtY, crtI, and crtB. The stop codons of individual crt genes except for crtB overlapped the start codons of the following crt genes. Escherichia coli transformants carrying the Erwinia uredovora carotenoid biosynthesis genes provide suitable substrates for carotenoid biosynthesis. The functions of the five crt genes of A. aurantiacum were determined through chromatographic and spectroscopic analyses of the pigments accumulated in some E. coli transformants carrying various combinations of the E. uredovora and A. aurantiacum carotenogenic genes. As a result, the astaxanthin biosynthetic pathway is proposed for the first time at the level of the biosynthesis genes. The crtW and crtZ gene products, which mediated the oxygenation reactions from beta-carotene to astaxanthin, were found to have low substrate specificity. This allowed the production of many presumed intermediates of astaxanthin, i.e., adonixanthin, phoenicoxanthin (adonirubin), canthaxanthin, 3'-hydroxyechinenone, and 3-hydroxyechinenone.	1
Title: Synergetic regulatory networks mediated by oncogene-driven microRNAs and transcription factors in serous ovarian cancer Abstract: Although high-grade serous ovarian cancer (OVC) is the most lethal gynecologic malignancy in women, little is known about the regulatory mechanisms in the cellular processes that lead to this cancer. Recently, accumulated lines of evidence have shown that the interplay between transcription factors (TFs) and microRNAs (miRNAs) is critical in cellular regulation during tumorigenesis. A comprehensive investigation of TFs and miRNAs, and their target genes, may provide a deeper understanding of the regulatory mechanisms in the pathology of OVC. In this study, we have integrated three complementary algorithms into a framework, aiming to infer the regulation by miRNAs and TFs in conjunction with gene expression profiles. We demonstrated the utility of our framework by inferring 67 OVC-specific regulatory feed-forward loops (FFL) initiated by miRNAs or TFs in high-grade serous OVC. By analyzing these regulatory behaviors, we found that all the 67 FFLs are consistent in their regulatory effects on genes that are jointly targeted by miRNAs and TFs. Remarkably, we unveiled an unbalanced distribution of FFLs with different oncogenic effects. In total, 31 of the 67 coherent FFLs were mainly initiated by oncogenes. On the contrary, only 4 of the FFLs were initiated by tumor suppressor genes. These overwhelmingly observed oncogenic genes were further detected in a sub-network with 32 FFLs centered by miRNA let-7b and TF TCF7L1 to regulate cell differentiation. Closer inspection of 32 FFLs revealed that 75% of the miRNAs reportedly play functional roles in cell differentiation, especially when enriched in epithelial-mesenchymal transitions. This study provides a comprehensive pathophysiological overview of recurring coherent circuits in OVC that are co-regulated by miRNAs and TFs. The prevalence of oncogenic coherent FFLs in serous OVC suggests that oncogene-driven regulatory motifs could cooperatively act upon critical cellular processes such as cell differentiation in a highly efficient and consistent manner.	0
Title: Alarmin-painted exosomes elicit persistent antitumor immunity in large established tumors in mice Abstract: Treating large established tumors is challenging for dendritic cell (DC)-based immunotherapy. DC activation with tumor cell-derived exosomes (TEXs) carrying multiple tumor-associated antigen can enhance tumor recognition. Adding a potent adjuvant, high mobility group nucleosome-binding protein 1 (HMGN1), boosts DCs' ability to activate T cells and improves vaccine efficiency. Here, we demonstrate that TEXs painted with the functional domain of HMGN1 (TEX-N1ND) via an exosomal anchor peptide potentiates DC immunogenicity. TEX-N1ND pulsed DCs (DCTEX-N1ND) elicit long-lasting antitumor immunity and tumor suppression in different syngeneic mouse models with large tumor burdens, most notably large, poorly immunogenic orthotopic hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). DCTEX-N1ND show increased homing to lymphoid tissues and contribute to augmented memory T cells. Importantly, N1ND-painted serum exosomes from cancer patients also promote DC activation. Our study demonstrates the potency of TEX-N1ND to strengthen DC immunogenicity and to suppress large established tumors, and thus provides an avenue to improve DC-based immunotherapy.	0
Title: Parvifoline AA Promotes Susceptibility of Hepatocarcinoma to Natural Killer Cell-Mediated Cytolysis by Targeting Peroxiredoxin Abstract: Natural killer (NK) cells play a crucial role in the surveillance of malignant cells. The engagement of NK group 2 member D (NKG2D) receptor with its ligands on target cells represents a promising therapeutic strategy against cancers. Here, we report that parvifoline AA (PAA), a natural ent-kaurane diterpenoid, markedly stimulates the expression of NKG2D ligands on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells, considerably enhancing their recognition and lysis by NK cells. We determined that PAA covalently binds to the conserved cysteine site of peroxiredoxins I/II (Prxs-I/II) and inhibits their catalytic activity, subsequently activating the ROS/ERK axis and the immunogenicity of HCC toward NK cells. Robust tumor growth inhibition by PAA dependent on NK cell activation was detected in vivo. Our data suggest Prxs-I/II as a promising cancer immune therapeutic target and provide a compelling rationale for further development of the inhibitor PAA as a sensitizer agent for NK cell-mediated HCC immunotherapy.	0
Title: Genome sequence of an industrial microorganism Streptomyces avermitilis: deducing the ability of producing secondary metabolites Abstract: Streptomyces avermitilis is a soil bacterium that carries out not only a complex morphological differentiation but also the production of secondary metabolites, one of which, avermectin, is commercially important in human and veterinary medicine. The major interest in this genus Streptomyces is the diversity of its production of secondary metabolites as an industrial microorganism. A major factor in its prominence as a producer of the variety of secondary metabolites is its possession of several metabolic pathways for biosynthesis. Here we report sequence analysis of S. avermitilis, covering 99% of its genome. At least 8.7 million base pairs exist in the linear chromosome; this is the largest bacterial genome sequence, and it provides insights into the intrinsic diversity of the production of the secondary metabolites of Streptomyces. Twenty-five kinds of secondary metabolite gene clusters were found in the genome of S. avermitilis. Four of them are concerned with the biosyntheses of melanin pigments, in which two clusters encode tyrosinase and its cofactor, another two encode an ochronotic pigment derived from homogentiginic acid, and another polyketide-derived melanin. The gene clusters for carotenoid and siderophore biosyntheses are composed of seven and five genes, respectively. There are eight kinds of gene clusters for type-I polyketide compound biosyntheses, and two clusters are involved in the biosyntheses of type-II polyketide-derived compounds. Furthermore, a polyketide synthase that resembles phloroglucinol synthase was detected. Eight clusters are involved in the biosyntheses of peptide compounds that are synthesized by nonribosomal peptide synthetases. These secondary metabolite clusters are widely located in the genome but half of them are near both ends of the genome. The total length of these clusters occupies about 6.4% of the genome.	1
Title: Biosynthesis of the Prenylated Salicylaldehyde Flavoglaucin Requires Temporary Reduction to Salicyl Alcohol for Decoration before Reoxidation to the Final Product Abstract: The biosynthetic pathway of the prenylated salicylaldehyde flavoglaucin and congeners in Aspergillus ruber was elucidated by genome mining, heterologous expression, precursor feeding, and biochemical characterization. The polyketide skeleton was released as alkylated salicyl alcohols, which is a prerequisite for consecutive hydroxylation and prenylation, before reoxidation to the final aldehyde products. Our results provide an excellent example for a highly programmed machinery in natural product biosynthesis.	1
Title: Gap, a mycobacterial specific integral membrane protein, is required for glycolipid transport to the cell surface Abstract: The cell envelope of mycobacteria is a complex multilaminar structure that protects the cell from stresses encountered in the environment, and plays an important role against the bactericidal activity of immune system cells. The outermost layer of the mycobacterial envelope typically contains species-specific glycolipids. Depending on the mycobacterial species, the major glycolipid localized at the surface can be either a phenolglycolipid or a peptidoglycolipid (GPL). Currently, the mechanism of how these glycolipids are addressed to the cell surface is not understood. In this study, by using a transposon library of Mycobacterium smegmatis and a simple dye assay, six genes involved in GPLs synthesis have been characterized. All of these genes are clustered in a single genomic region of approximately 60 kb. We show by biochemical analyses that two non-ribosomal peptide synthetases, a polyketide synthase, a methyltransferase and a member of the MmpL family are required for the biosynthesis of the GPLs backbone. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a small integral membrane protein of 272 amino acids named Gap (gap: GPL addressing protein) is specifically required for the transport of the GPLs to the cell surface. This protein is predicted to contain six transmembrane segments and possesses homologues across the mycobacterial genus, thus delineating a new protein family. This Gap family represents a new paradigm for the transport of small molecules across the mycobacterial envelope, a critical determinant of mycobacterial virulence.	1
Title: Separation of donor and recipient bacteria by column chromatography Abstract: When donor and recipient strains of Escherichia coli were added to columns containing Cellex-P (a cation-exchange cellulose), more than 80% of the female cells passed through the column but only 11% or less of the male cells were eluted. However, when donor strains were blended before their addition to the column, the majority of these cells were eluted. These results indicated that the filamentous appendages termed F pili (which are removed by blending) were the structures responsible for the adherence of donor cells to the cellulose.	0
Title: Genome sequences of four divergent multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii strains isolated from patients with sepsis or osteomyelitis Abstract: Acinetobacter baumannii is a Gram-negative bacterium that causes nosocomial infections worldwide, with recent prevalence and higher frequency in wounded military personnel. Four A. baumannii strains from the Walter Reed Army Medical Center (WRAMC) isolated between 2008 and 2009 were sequenced, representing diverse, multidrug-resistant isolates from osteomyelitis or septic patients.	0
Title: Phylogenomic Analysis of Natural Products Biosynthetic Gene Clusters Allows Discovery of Arseno-Organic Metabolites in Model Streptomycetes Abstract: Natural products from microbes have provided humans with beneficial antibiotics for millennia. However, a decline in the pace of antibiotic discovery exerts pressure on human health as antibiotic resistance spreads, a challenge that may better faced by unveiling chemical diversity produced by microbes. Current microbial genome mining approaches have revitalized research into antibiotics, but the empirical nature of these methods limits the chemical space that is explored.Here, we address the problem of finding novel pathways by incorporating evolutionary principles into genome mining. We recapitulated the evolutionary history of twenty-three enzyme families previously uninvestigated in the context of natural product biosynthesis in Actinobacteria, the most proficient producers of natural products. Our genome evolutionary analyses where based on the assumption that expanded-repurposed enzyme families-from central metabolism, occur frequently and thus have the potential to catalyze new conversions in the context of natural products biosynthesis. Our analyses led to the discovery of biosynthetic gene clusters coding for hidden chemical diversity, as validated by comparing our predictions with those from state-of-the-art genome mining tools; as well as experimentally demonstrating the existence of a biosynthetic pathway for arseno-organic metabolites in Streptomyces coelicolor and Streptomyces lividans, Using a gene knockout and metabolite profile combined strategy.As our approach does not rely solely on sequence similarity searches of previously identified biosynthetic enzymes, these results establish the basis for the development of an evolutionary-driven genome mining tool termed EvoMining that complements current platforms. We anticipate that by doing so real 'chemical dark matter' will be unveiled.	1
Title: Molecular genetic analysis reveals that a nonribosomal peptide synthetase-like (NRPS-like) gene in Aspergillus nidulans is responsible for microperfuranone biosynthesis Abstract: Genome sequencing of Aspergillus species including Aspergillus nidulans has revealed that there are far more secondary metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters than secondary metabolites isolated from these organisms. This implies that these organisms can produce additional secondary metabolites, which have not yet been elucidated. The A. nidulans genome contains 12 nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS), one hybrid polyketide synthase/NRPS, and 14 NRPS-like genes. The only NRPS-like gene in A. nidulans with a known product is tdiA, which is involved in terrequinone A biosynthesis. To attempt to identify the products of these NRPS-like genes, we replaced the native promoters of the NRPS-like genes with the inducible alcohol dehydrogenase (alcA) promoter. Our results demonstrated that induction of the single NRPS-like gene AN3396.4 led to the enhanced production of microperfuranone. Furthermore, heterologous expression of AN3396.4 in Aspergillus niger confirmed that only one NRPS-like gene, AN3396.4, is necessary for the production of microperfuranone.	1
Title: Degeneration of aflatoxin gene clusters in Aspergillus flavus from Africa and North America Abstract: Aspergillus flavus is the most common causal agent of aflatoxin contamination of food and feed. However, aflatoxin-producing potential varies widely among A. flavus genotypes with many producing no aflatoxins. Some non-aflatoxigenic genotypes are used as biocontrol agents to prevent contamination. Aflatoxin biosynthesis genes are tightly clustered in a highly conserved order. Gene deletions and presence of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in aflatoxin biosynthesis genes are often associated with A. flavus inability to produce aflatoxins. In order to identify mechanisms of non-aflatoxigenicity in non-aflatoxigenic genotypes of value in aflatoxin biocontrol, complete cluster sequences of 35 A. flavus genotypes from Africa and North America were analyzed. Inability of some genotypes to produce aflatoxin resulted from deletion of biosynthesis genes. In other genotypes, non-aflatoxigenicity originated from SNP formation. The process of degeneration differed across the gene cluster; genes involved in early biosynthesis stages were more likely to be deleted while genes involved in later stages displayed high frequencies of SNPs. Comparative analyses of aflatoxin gene clusters provides insight into the diversity of mechanisms of non-aflatoxigenicity in A. flavus genotypes used as biological control agents. The sequences provide resources for both diagnosis of non-aflatoxigenicity and monitoring of biocontrol genotypes during biopesticide manufacture and in the environment.	1
Title: Transcriptional and bioinformatic analysis of the 56.8 kb DNA region amplified in tandem repeats containing the penicillin gene cluster in Penicillium chrysogenum Abstract: High penicillin-producing strains of Penicillium chrysogenum contain 6-14 copies of the three clustered structural biosynthetic genes, pcbAB, pcbC, and penDE [Barredo, J.L., Díez, B., Alvarez, E., Martín, J.F., 1989. Large amplification of a 35-kb DNA fragment carrying two penicillin biosynthetic genes in high penicillin producing strains of Penicillium chrysogenum. Curr. Genet. 16, 453-459; Smith, D.J., Bull, J.H., Edwards, J., Turner, G., 1989. Amplification of the isopenicillin N synthetase gene in a strain of Penicillium chrysogenum producing high levels of penicillin. Mol. Gen. Genet. 216, 492-497.] . The cluster is located in a 56.8 kb DNA region bounded by a conserved TGTAAA/T hexanucleotide that undergoes amplification in tandem repeats [Fierro, F., Barredo, J.L., Díez, B., Gutiérrez, S., Fernández, F.J., Martín, J.F., 1995. The penicillin gene cluster is amplified in tandem repeats linked by conserved hexanucleotide sequences. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 92, 6200-6204; Newbert, R.W., Barton, B., Greaves, P., Harper, J., Turner, G., 1997. Analysis of a commercially improved Penicillium chrysogenum strain series: involvement of recombinogenic regions in amplification and deletion of the penicillin biosynthesis gene cluster. J. Ind. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 19, 18-27]. Transcriptional analysis of this amplified region (AR) revealed the presence of at least eight transcripts expressed in penicillin producing conditions. Three of them correspond to the known penicillin biosynthetic genes, pcbAB, pcbC, and penDE. To locate genes related to penicillin precursor formation, or penicillin transport and regulation we have sequenced and analyzed the 56.8 kb amplified region of P. chrysogenum AS-P-78, finding a total of 16 open reading frames. Two of these ORFs have orthologues of known function in the databases. Other ORFs showed similarities to specific domains occurring in different proteins and superfamilies which allowed to infer their probable function. ORF11 encodes a D-amino acid oxidase that might be responsible for the conversion of D-amino acids in the tripeptide L-alpha-aminoadipyl-L-cysteinyl-D-valine or other beta-lactam intermediates to deaminated by-products. ORF12 encodes a predicted protein with similarity to saccharopine dehydrogenases that seems to be related to biosynthesis of the penicillin precursor alpha-aminoadipic acid. A deletion mutant, P. chrysogenum npe10 lacking the entire AR including ORF12, shows a partial requirement of L-lysine for growth. ORF13 encodes a putative protein containing a Zn(II)2-Cys6 fungal-type DNA-binding domain, probably a transcriptional regulator. Although some of the ORFs in the AR may play roles in increasing penicillin production, none of the 13 ORFs other than pcbAB, pcbC, and penDE seem to be strictly indispensable for penicillin biosynthesis. The genes located in the P. chrysogenum AR have been compared with those found in the Aspergillus nidulans 50 kb DNA region adjacent to the penicillin gene cluster, showing no conservation between these two fungi.	1
Title: Identification and organization of genes for diutan polysaccharide synthesis from Sphingomonas sp. ATCC 53159 Abstract: A cluster of genes for diutan polysaccharide synthesis was isolated from a library of Sphingomonas sp. ATCC 53159 genomic DNA by complementation of glucosyl-isoprenylphosphate transferase-deficient mutants of Sphingomonas elodea ATCC 31461 (producing gellan) and Xanthomonas campestris (producing xanthan). The synthesis of polysaccharide in these strains shares a common first step, transfer of glucose-1-phosphate from UDP-glucose to the isoprenylphosphate lipid. The cluster of 24 genes was compared to genes for biosynthesis of gellan, and S-88 sphingan from Sphingomonas sp. ATCC 31554. Diutan, gellan and S-88 sphingan have a common four-sugar backbone but different side chains, one rhamnose for S-88 sphingan, a two-rhamnose side chain for diutan and no side chain for gellan. The genes for biosynthesis of diutan, gellan and S-88 sphingan were similar in general organization but differed in location of some genes, in particular, dpsG (putative polymerase), dpsR (putative lyase) and dpsS (putative repeat unit transporter). An unidentified reading frame urf31, present in the gene clusters for diutan and S-88 sphingan but not gellan, had similarity to glycosyl transferase group 2 proteins, and was detrimental when cloned in Sphingomonas elodea producing gellan that lacks a side chain, but not in Sphingomonas ATCC 31554 producing S-88 sphingan with a rhamnose side chain. Gene urf31 could possibly encode a side-chain rhamnosyl transferase. Another gene urf31.4 was unique to the diutan gene cluster. A plasmid containing 20 of the 24 genes resulted in a slight increase in the amount of diutan produced, but a significant increase in the rheological properties of diutan.	1
Title: Biosynthesis of the antitumor agent chartreusin involves the oxidative rearrangement of an anthracyclic polyketide Abstract: Chartreusin is a potent antitumor agent with a mixed polyketide-carbohydrate structure produced by Streptomyces chartreusis. Three type II polyketide synthase (PKS) gene clusters were identified from an S. chartreusis HKI-249 genomic cosmid library, one of which encodes chartreusin (cha) biosynthesis, as confirmed by heterologous expression of the entire cha gene cluster in Streptomyces albus. Molecular analysis of the approximately 37 kb locus and structure elucidation of a linear pathway intermediate from an engineered mutant reveal that the unusual bis-lactone aglycone chartarin is derived from an anthracycline-type polyketide. A revised biosynthetic model involving an oxidative rearrangement is presented.	1
Title: Regulatory and biosynthetic effects of the bkd gene clusters on the production of daptomycin and its analogs A21978C1-3 Abstract: Daptomycin is a cyclic lipopeptide antibiotic produced by Streptomyces roseosporus in an acidic peptide complex A21978C. In this complex, A21978C1-3 is most abundant and contains branched-chain fatty acyl groups, while daptomycin has a straight decanoic acyl group. The branched-chain α-keto acid dehydrogenase complex (BCDH complex), encoded by bkd gene clusters in Streptomyces, is responsible for the early step of converting branched-chain amino acids into branched-chain fatty acids. In a daptomycin industrial producer S. roseosporus L30, two alleles of bkd gene clusters, bkdA1B1C1/bkdA2B2C2, and a regulatory gene bkdR located upstream of bkdA2B2C2 are identified. We show that BkdR positively regulated bkdA2B2C2 expression and was negatively auto-regulated, but is not directly involved in regulation of daptomycin gene cluster expression. However, BkdR is required for both daptomycin and A21978C1-3 production. Furthermore, deletion of bkdA2B2C2 only led to partial reduction of A21978C1-3 production, while the ΔbkdA1B1C1 mutant shows very weak production of A21978C1-3, and the double bkd mutant has a similar production profile as the single ΔbkdA1B1C1 mutant, suggesting that bkdA1B1C1 gene cluster plays a dominant role in branched-chain fatty acid biosynthesis. So we reveal a unique regulatory function of BkdR and genetic engineered a bkd null strain for daptomycin production with reduced impurities.	1
Title: Practical Synthesis of Amides via Copper/ABNO-Catalyzed Aerobic Oxidative Coupling of Alcohols and Amines Abstract: A modular Cu/ABNO catalyst system has been identified that enables efficient aerobic oxidative coupling of alcohols and amines to amides. All four permutations of benzylic/aliphatic alcohols and primary/secondary amines are viable in this reaction, enabling broad access to secondary and tertiary amides. The reactions exhibit excellent functional group compatibility and are complete within 30 min-3 h at rt. All components of the catalyst system are commercially available.	0
Title: Total synthesis of (+/-)-strychnine via a [4 + 2]-cycloaddition/rearrangement cascade Abstract: A new strategy for the synthesis of the Strychnos alkaloid (+/-)-strychnine has been developed and is based on an intramolecular [4 + 2]-cycloaddition/rearrangement cascade of an indolyl-substituted amidofuran. The critical D-ring was assembled by an intramolecular palladium-catalyzed enolate-driven cross-coupling of an N-tethered vinyl iodide. [reaction: see text].	0
Title: Delineating the biosynthesis of gentamicin x2, the common precursor of the gentamicin C antibiotic complex Abstract: Gentamicin C complex is a mixture of aminoglycoside antibiotics used worldwide to treat severe Gram-negative bacterial infections. Despite its clinical importance, the enzymology of its biosynthetic pathway has remained obscure. We report here insights into the four enzyme-catalyzed steps that lead from the first-formed pseudotrisaccharide gentamicin A2 to gentamicin X2, the last common intermediate for all components of the C complex. We have used both targeted mutations of individual genes and reconstitution of portions of the pathway in vitro to show that the secondary alcohol function at C-3″ of A2 is first converted to an amine, catalyzed by the tandem operation of oxidoreductase GenD2 and transaminase GenS2. The amine is then specifically methylated by the S-adenosyl-l-methionine (SAM)-dependent N-methyltransferase GenN to form gentamicin A. Finally, C-methylation at C-4″ to form gentamicin X2 is catalyzed by the radical SAM-dependent and cobalamin-dependent enzyme GenD1.	1
Title: Palladium-Catalyzed Fluorosulfonylvinylation of Organic Iodides Abstract: A palladium-catalyzed fluorosulfonylvinylation reaction of organic iodides is described. Catalytic Pd(OAc)2 with a stoichiometric amount of silver(I) trifluoroacetate enables the coupling process between either an (hetero)aryl or alkenyl iodide with ethenesulfonyl fluoride (ESF). The method is demonstrated in the successful syntheses of eighty-eight otherwise difficult to access compounds, in up to 99 % yields, including the unprecedented 2-heteroarylethenesulfonyl fluorides and 1,3-dienylsulfonyl fluorides.	0
Title: Rapid screening for freshwater bacterial groups by using reverse line blot hybridization Abstract: The identification of phylogenetic clusters of bacteria that are common in freshwater has provided a basis for probe design to target important freshwater groups. We present a set of 16S ribosomal RNA gene-based oligonucleotide probes specific for 15 of these freshwater clusters. The probes were applied in reverse line blot hybridization, a simple method that enables the rapid screening of PCR products from many samples against an array of probes. The optimized assay was made stringent to discriminate at approximately the single-mismatch level. This made 10 of the probes highly specific, with at least two mismatches to the closest noncluster member in the global database. Screening of PCR products from bacterioplankton of 81 diverse lakes from Belgium, The Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden, and Norway showed that the respective probes were reactive against 5 to 100% of the lake samples. Positive reactivity of six highly specific probes showed that bacteria from actinobacterial clusters ACK-M1 and Sta2-30 and from verrucomicrobial cluster CLO-14 occurred in at least 90% of the investigated lakes. Furthermore, bacteria from alpha-proteobacterial cluster LD12 (closely related to the marine SAR11 cluster), beta-proteobacterial cluster LD28 and cyanobacterial cluster Synechococcus 6b occurred in more than 70% of the lakes. Reverse line blot hybridization is a new tool in microbial ecology that will facilitate research on distribution and habitat specificity of target species at relatively low costs.	0
Title: Fungal indole alkaloid biosynthesis: genetic and biochemical investigation of the tryptoquialanine pathway in Penicillium aethiopicum Abstract: Tremorgenic mycotoxins are a group of indole alkaloids which include the quinazoline-containing tryptoquivaline (2) that are capable of eliciting intermittent or sustained tremors in vertebrate animals. The biosynthesis of this group of bioactive compounds, which are characterized by an acetylated quinazoline ring connected to a 6-5-5 imidazoindolone ring system via a 5-membered spirolactone, has remained uncharacterized. Here, we report the identification of a gene cluster (tqa) from P. aethiopicum that is involved in the biosynthesis of tryptoquialanine (1), which is structurally similar to 2. The pathway has been confirmed to go through an intermediate common to the fumiquinazoline pathway, fumiquinazoline F, which originates from a fungal trimodular nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS). By systematically inactivating every biosynthetic gene in the cluster, followed by isolation and characterization of the intermediates, we were able to establish the biosynthetic sequence of the pathway. An unusual oxidative opening of the pyrazinone ring by an FAD-dependent berberine bridge enzyme-like oxidoreductase has been proposed based on genetic knockout studies. Notably, a 2-aminoisobutyric acid (AIB)-utilizing NRPS module has been identified and reconstituted in vitro, along with two putative enzymes of unknown functions that are involved in the synthesis of the unnatural amino acid by genetic analysis. This work provides new genetic and biochemical insights into the biosynthesis of this group of fungal alkaloids, including the tremorgens related to 2.	1
Title: The KtrA and KtrE subunits are required for Na+-dependent K+ uptake by KtrB across the plasma membrane in Synechocystis sp. strain PCC 6803 Abstract: The Na+-dependent K+ uptake KtrABE system is essential for the adaptation of Synechocystis to salinity stress and high osmolality. While KtrB forms the K+-translocating pore, the role of the subunits KtrA and KtrE for Ktr function remains elusive. Here, we characterized the role of KtrA and KtrE in Ktr-mediated K+ uptake and in modulating Na+ dependency. Expression of KtrB alone in a K+ uptake-deficient Escherichia coli strain conferred low K+ uptake activity that was not stimulated by Na+. Coexpression of both KtrA and KtrE with KtrB increased the K+ transport activity in a Na+-dependent manner. KtrA and KtrE were found to be localized to the plasma membrane in Synechocystis. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to analyze the role of single charged residues in KtrB for Ktr function. Replacing negatively charged residues facing the extracellular space with residues of the opposite charge increased the apparent Km for K+ in all cases. However, none of the mutations eliminated the Na+ dependency of Ktr-mediated K+ transport. Mutations of residues on the cytoplasmic side had larger effects on K+ uptake activity than those of residues on the extracellular side. Further analysis revealed that replacement of R262, which is well conserved among Ktr/Trk/HKT transporters in the third extracellular loop, by Glu abolished transport activity. The atomic-scale homology model indicated that R262 might interact with E247 and D261. Based on these data, interaction of KtrA and KtrE with KtrB increased the K+ uptake rate and conferred Na+ dependency.	0
Title: Cytochalasin B: effect on lysosomal enzyme release from human leukocytes Abstract: The morphological and biochemical consequences of treatment of human peripheral blood leukocytes with cytochalasin B were studied. Incubation of human polymorphs with cytochalasin B resulted in nuclear and cytoplasmic spreading, but not in spontaneous release of lysosomal enzymes. Cytochalasin B inhibited particle uptake. Consequently, phagocytic vacuoles were not observed; instead, granule contents were discharged directly into the surrounding medium when cytochalasin B-treated cells were challenged with zymosan particles. Cytochalasin B enhanced the release of lysosomal enzymes from human polymorphonuclear leukocytes whether these encountered zymosan particles or immune complexes on a nonphagocytosable Millipore filter. Cytochalasin B-treated leukocytes thus constitute a model system for quantitative study of lysosome fusion. Augmented enzyme release was blocked by prior treatment of cells with pharmacological doses of agents that influence the accumulation of cyclic nucleotides (cyclic nucleotides themselves, prostaglandin E(1)) or by compounds that interfere with microtubule function (e.g., colchicine, vinblastine). These observations suggest that one action of cytochalasin B on phagocytic cells is to remove the normal constraints to merger of granules, either with each other or with the plasma membrane, and that intact microtubule function is required for translocation of lysosomes.	0
Title: Catalytic asymmetric γ-alkylation of carbonyl compounds via stereoconvergent Suzuki cross-couplings Abstract: With the aid of a chiral nickel catalyst, enantioselective γ- (and δ-) alkylations of carbonyl compounds can be achieved through the coupling of γ-haloamides with alkylboranes. In addition to primary alkyl nucleophiles, for the first time for an asymmetric cross-coupling of an unactivated alkyl electrophile, an arylmetal, a boronate ester, and a secondary (cyclopropyl) alkylmetal compound are shown to couple with significant enantioselectivity. A mechanistic study indicates that cleavage of the carbon-halogen bond of the electrophile is irreversible under the conditions for asymmetric carbon-carbon bond formation.	0
Title: Two Fis regulators directly repress the expression of numerous effector-encoding genes in Legionella pneumophila Abstract: Legionella pneumophila is an intracellular human pathogen that utilizes the Icm/Dot type IVB secretion system to translocate a large repertoire of effectors into host cells. For most of these effectors, there is no information regarding their regulation. Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine the involvement of the three L. pneumophila Fis homologs in the regulation of effector-encoding genes. Deletion mutants constructed in the genes encoding the three Fis regulators revealed that Fis1 (lpg0542 gene) and Fis3 (lpg1743) but not Fis2 (lpg1370) are partially required for intracellular growth of L. pneumophila in Acanthamoeba castellanii. To identify pathogenesis-related genes directly regulated by Fis, we established a novel in vivo system which resulted in the discovery of numerous effector-encoding genes directly regulated by Fis. Further examination of these genes revealed that Fis1 and Fis3 repress the level of expression of effector-encoding genes during exponential phase. Three groups of effector-encoding genes were identified: (i) effectors regulated mainly by Fis1, (ii) effectors regulated mainly by Fis3, and (iii) effectors regulated by both Fis1 and Fis3. Examination of the upstream regulatory region of all of these effector-encoding genes revealed multiple putative Fis regulatory elements, and site-directed mutagenesis confirmed that a few of these sites constitute part of a repressor binding element. Furthermore, gel mobility shift assays demonstrated the direct relation between the Fis1 and Fis3 regulators and these regulatory elements. Collectively, our results demonstrate for the first time that two of the three L. pneumophila Fis regulators directly repress the expression of Icm/Dot effector-encoding genes.	0
Title: The mineral weathering ability of Collimonas pratensis PMB3(1) involves a Malleobactin-mediated iron acquisition system Abstract: Mineral weathering by microorganisms is considered to occur through a succession of mechanisms based on acidification and chelation. While the role of acidification is established, the role of siderophores is difficult to disentangle from the effect of the acidification. We took advantage of the ability of strain Collimonas pratensis PMB3(1) to weather minerals but not to acidify depending on the carbon source to address the role of siderophores in mineral weathering. We identified a single non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) responsible for siderophore biosynthesis in the PMB3(1) genome. By combining iron-chelating assays, targeted mutagenesis and chemical analyses (HPLC and LC-ESI-HRMS), we identified the siderophore produced as malleobactin X and how its production depends on the concentration of available iron. Comparison with the genome sequences of other collimonads evidenced that malleobactin production seems to be a relatively conserved functional trait, though some collimonads harboured other siderophore synthesis systems. We also revealed by comparing the wild-type strain and its mutant impaired in the production of malleobactin that the ability to produce this siderophore is essential to allow the dissolution of hematite under non-acidifying conditions. This study represents the first characterization of the siderophore produced by collimonads and its role in mineral weathering.	1
Title: Heterologous expression and genetic engineering of the phenalinolactone biosynthetic gene cluster by using red/ET recombineering Abstract: The heterologous expression of natural product biosynthetic pathways is of increasing interest in biotechnology and drug discovery. This approach enables the production of complex metabolites in more amenable host organisms and provides the basis for the generation of novel analogues through genetic engineering. Here we describe a straightforward strategy for the heterologous expression of the highly complex phenalinolactone biosynthetic pathway, which was recently cloned from Streptomyces sp. Tü6071. The biosynthetic gene cluster comprises at least 11 transcriptional units that harbor 35 genes, which together catalyze the assembly of structurally unique tricyclic terpene glycosides with antibacterial activity. By using Red/ET recombineering, the phenalinolactone pathway was reconstituted from two cosmids and heterologously expressed in several Streptomyces strains. The established expression system now provides a convenient platform for functional investigations of the biosynthetic genes and the generation of novel analogues, by genetic engineering of the pathway in Escherichia coli. Deletion of a modifying gene from the expression construct resulted in a novel, unglycosylated phenalinolactone derivative; this demonstrates the promise of this methodology.	1
Title: A yeast chemical genetic screen identifies inhibitors of human telomerase Abstract: Telomerase comprises a reverse transcriptase and an internal RNA template that maintains telomeres in many eukaryotes, and it is a well-validated cancer target. However, there is a dearth of small molecules with efficacy against human telomerase in vivo. We developed a surrogate yeast high-throughput assay to identify human telomerase inhibitors. The reversibility of growth arrest induced by active human telomerase was assessed against a library of 678 compounds preselected for bioactivity in S. cerevisiae. Four of eight compounds identified reproducibly restored growth to strains expressing active human telomerase, and three of these four compounds also specifically inhibited purified human telomerase in vitro. These compounds represent probes for human telomerase function, and potential entry points for development of lead compounds against telomerase-positive cancers.	0
Title: Cell-Free Protein Synthesis: Pros and Cons of Prokaryotic and Eukaryotic Systems Abstract: From its start as a small-scale in vitro system to study fundamental translation processes, cell-free protein synthesis quickly rose to become a potent platform for the high-yield production of proteins. In contrast to classical in vivo protein expression, cell-free systems do not need time-consuming cloning steps, and the open nature provides easy manipulation of reaction conditions as well as high-throughput potential. Especially for the synthesis of difficult to express proteins, such as toxic and transmembrane proteins, cell-free systems are of enormous interest. The modification of the genetic code to incorporate non-canonical amino acids into the target protein in particular provides enormous potential in biotechnology and pharmaceutical research and is in the focus of many cell-free projects. Many sophisticated cell-free systems for manifold applications have been established. This review describes the recent advances in cell-free protein synthesis and details the expanding applications in this field.	0
Title: Antibacterial Paramagnetic Quinones from Actinoallomurus Abstract: Four metabolites, designated paramagnetoquinone A, B, C, and D (1-4), were isolated from three strains belonging to the actinomycete genus Actinoallomurus. Compounds 1 and 2 showed potent antibacterial activity with MIC values lower than 0.015 μg/mL against Gram-positive pathogens, including antibiotic-resistant strains. Since compounds 1 and 2 were NMR-silent due to the presence of an oxygen radical, structure elucidation was achieved through a combination of derivatizations, oxidations, and analysis of 13C-labeled compounds. The paramagnetoquinones share the same carbon scaffold as tetracenomycin but carry two quinones and a five-membered lactone fused to the aromatic system. Compounds 2 and 1 are identical except for an unprecedented replacement of a methoxy in 2 by a methylamino group in 1. Related compounds devoid of methyl group(s) and of antibacterial activity were isolated from a different Actinoallomurus strain. The likely pmq biosynthetic gene cluster was identified from strain ID145113. While the cluster encodes many of the expected enzymes involved in the formation of aromatic polyketides, it also encodes a dedicated ketoacid dehydrogenase complex and an unusual acyl carrier protein transacylase, suggesting that an unusual starter unit might prime the polyketide synthase.	1
Title: SUMO-mimicking peptides inhibiting protein SUMOylation Abstract: The ubiquitin-like protein SUMO is transferred through a core E1-E2 cascade composed of the SUMO-activating enzyme (SAE) and Ubc9 to modify cellular proteins and transmit important biological signals. SAE primarily recognizes the C-terminal tail of SUMO and catalyzes ATP condensation with the SUMO C-terminal carboxylate to activate its transfer through the cascade. Here, we used phage display to show that a broad profile of SUMO C-terminal sequences could be activated by SAE. Based on this, we developed heptamer peptides that could 1) form thioester conjugates with SAE, 2) be transferred from SAE to Ubc9, and 3) be further transferred to the SUMOylation target protein RanGAP1. As these peptides recapitulate the action of SUMO in protein modification, we refer to them as "SUMO-mimicking peptides". We found that, once the peptides were conjugated to SAE and Ubc9, they blocked full-length SUMO from entering the cascade. These peptides can thus function as mechanism-based inhibitors of the protein SUMOylation reaction.	0
Title: A ring-like nucleoid is not necessary for radioresistance in the Deinococcaceae Abstract: Background:                       Transmission electron microscopy images of Deinococcus radiodurans R1 suggest that the nucleoid of this species exists as a "ring-like" body, and have led to speculation that this structure contributes to the radioresistance of the species. Since extreme radioresistance is characteristic of six other species of Deinococcus, we have attempted to correlate nucleoid morphology and radioresistance by determining whether the genomic DNA of each of these species exhibit similar structures.                  Results:                       The nucleoid morphologies of seven recognized species of Deinococcus, the radioresistant bacterium Rubrobacter radiotolerans, and the more radiosensitive deinococcal relative Thermus aquaticus were evaluated using epifluorescence and deconvolution techniques. Although the nucleoids of Deinococcus murrayi, Deinococcus proteolyticus, Deinococcus radiophilus, and Deinococcus grandis have structures similar to D. radiodurans, the majority of nucleoids found in Deinococcus radiopugnans and Deinococcus geothermalis lack any specific organization. The nucleoid of R. radiotolerans consists of multiple highly condensed spheres of DNA scattered throughout the cell. The genomic DNA of Thermus aquaticus is uniformly distributed throughout the cell.                  Conclusion:                       There is no obvious relationship between the shape of a species' nucleoid and extreme radioresistance. However, the genomes of all extremely radioresistance species examined are highly condensed relative to more radiosensitive species. Whether DNA in this tightly packed configuration contributes to the radioresistance of these bacteria remains unknown, but this common structural feature appears to limit diffusion of fragments generated post-irradiation even in cells incapable of repairing strand breaks.	0
Title: Diversity Indices of Plant Communities and Their Rhizosphere Microbiomes: An Attempt to Find the Connection Abstract: The rhizosphere community represents an "ecological interface" between plant and soil, providing the plant with a number of advantages. Despite close connection and mutual influence in this system, the knowledge about the connection of plant and rhizosphere diversity is still controversial. One of the most valuable factors of this uncertainty is a rough estimation of plant diversity. NGS sequencing can make the estimations of the plant community more precise than classical geobotanical methods. We investigate fallow and crop sites, which are similar in terms of environmental conditions and soil legacy, yet at the same time are significantly different in terms of plant diversity. We explored amplicons of both the plant root mass (ITS1 DNA) and the microbial communities (16S rDNA); determined alpha- and beta-diversity indices and their correlation, and performed differential abundance analysis. In the analysis, there is no correlation between the alpha-diversity indices of plants and the rhizosphere microbial communities. The beta-diversity between rhizosphere microbial communities and plant communities is highly correlated (R = 0.866, p = 0.01). ITS1 sequencing is effective for the description of plant root communities. There is a connection between rhizosphere communities and the composition of plants, but on the alpha-diversity level we found no correlation. In the future, the connection of alpha-diversities should be explored using ITS1 sequencing, even in more similar plant communities-for example, in different synusia.	0
Title: Probing Labdane-Related Diterpenoid Biosynthesis in the Fungal Genus Aspergillus Abstract: While terpenoid production is generally associated with plants, a variety of fungi contain operons predicted to lead to such biosynthesis. Notably, fungi contain a number of cyclases characteristic of labdane-related diterpenoid metabolism, which have not been much explored. These also are often found near cytochrome P450 (CYP) mono-oxygenases that presumably further decorate the ensuing diterpene, suggesting that these fungi might produce more elaborate diterpenoids. To probe the functional diversity of such biosynthetic capacity, an investigation of the phylogenetically diverse cyclases and associated CYPs from the fungal genus Aspergillus was undertaken, revealing their ability to produce isopimaradiene-derived diterpenoids. Intriguingly, labdane-related diterpenoid biosynthetic genes are largely found in plant-associated fungi, hinting that these natural products may play a role in such interactions. Accordingly, it is hypothesized here that isopimarane production may assist the plant-saprophytic lifestyle of Aspergillus fungi.	0
Title: Biosynthesis of 2-deoxystreptamine-containing antibiotics in Streptoalloteichus hindustanus JCM 3268: characterization of 2-deoxy-scyllo-inosose synthase Abstract: A part of the new biosynthetic gene cluster for 2-deoxystreptamine-containing antibiotics was identified from Streptoalloteichus hindustanus. The alloH gene in the gene cluster was deduced to encode 2-deoxy-scyllo-inosose synthase and the expressed protein AlloH was confirmed to have this enzyme activity. Furthermore, biochemical properties of AlloH were studied.	1
Title: Butirosin-biosynthetic gene cluster from Bacillus circulans Abstract: Butirosin is an interesting 2-deoxystreptamine (DOS)-containing aminoglycoside antibiotic produced by non-actinomycete Bacilli. Recently we were successful in purification of 2-deoxy-scyllo-inosose synthase from butirosin-producer Bacillus circulans as the key enzyme for the biosynthesis of DOS, in cloning of the responsible gene (btrC), and in its overexpression in Escherichia coli. The present study involved gene-walking approach, which allowed us to find a gene cluster around btrC. The function of each gene was further investigated by gene disruption, and the disruptants of btrB, btrC, btrD and btrM showed no antibiotic producing activity. Therefore, the gene cluster found so far was determined to be a part of the butirosin biosynthetic gene cluster. Functions of some ORFs are also discussed in terms of butirosin biosynthesis on the basis of database search.	1
Title: The structural gene for microcin H47 encodes a peptide precursor with antibiotic activity Abstract: Microcin H47 is a bactericidal antibiotic produced by a naturally occurring Escherichia coli strain isolated in Uruguay. The microcin genetic system is located in the chromosome and extends over a 10-kb DNA segment containing the genes required for microcin synthesis, secretion, and immunity. The smallest microcin synthesis gene, mchB, was sequenced and shown to encode a highly hydrophobic peptide. An mchB-phoA gene fusion, which directed the synthesis of a hybrid bifunctional protein with both PhoA and microcin H47-like activities, was isolated. The results presented herein lead us to propose that microcin H47 is indeed a ribosomally synthesized peptide antibiotic and that its peptide precursor already has antibiotic activity of the same specificity as that of mature microcin.	1
Title: A polyketide synthase is required for fungal virulence and production of the polyketide T-toxin Abstract: Race T of the fungal pathogen Cochliobolus heterostrophus is highly virulent toward Texas male sterile (T) maize and differs from its relative, race O, at a locus (Tox1) that is responsible for the production of T-toxin, a family of linear long-chain (C35 to E41) polyketides. In a previous study, the restriction enzyme-mediated integration procedure was used to mutagenize and tag Tox1. Here, we report that the DNA recovered from the insertion site of one mutant encodes a 7.6-kb open reading frame (2530 amino acids) that identifies a multifunctional polyketide synthase (PKS)-encoding gene (PKS1) with six catalytic domains arranged in the following order, starting at the N terminus: beta-ketoacyl synthase, acyltransferase, dehydratase, enoyl reductase, beta-ketoacyl reductase, and acyl carrier protein. PKS1 is interrupted by four apparent introns (74, 57, 49, and 41 bp) and exists in the genome as a single copy surrounded by highly repetitive, A + T-rich DNA. When PKS1 in race T was inactivated by targeted gene disruption, T-toxin production and high virulence were eliminated, indicating that this PKS is required for fungal virulence. Race O strains, which do not produce T-toxin, lack a detectable homolog of PKS1, suggesting that race T may have acquired PKS1 by horizontal transfer of DNA rather than by vertical inheritance from an ancestral strain.	1
Title: A biosynthetic gene cluster for a secreted cellobiose lipid with antifungal activity from Ustilago maydis Abstract: The phytopathogenic basidiomycetous fungus Ustilago maydis secretes large amounts of the glycolipid biosurfactant ustilagic acid (UA). UA consists of 15,16-dihydroxypalmitic or 2,15,16-trihydroxypalmitic acid, which is O-glycosidically linked to cellobiose at its terminal hydroxyl group. In addition, the cellobiose moiety is acetylated and acylated with a short-chain hydroxy fatty acid. We have identified a 58 kb spanning gene cluster that contains 12 open reading frames coding for most, if not all, enzymes needed for UA biosynthesis. Using a combination of genetic and mass spectrometric analysis we were able to assign functional roles to three of the proteins encoded by the gene cluster. This allowed us to propose a biosynthesis route for UA. The Ahd1 protein belongs to the family of non-haem diiron reductases and is required for alpha-hydroxylation of palmitic acid. Two P450 monooxygenases, Cyp1 and Cyp2, catalyse terminal and subterminal hydroxylation of palmitic acid. We could demonstrate that infection of tomato leaves by the plant pathogenic fungus Botrytis cinerea is prevented by co-inoculation with wild-type U. maydis sporidia. U. maydis mutants defective in UA biosynthesis were unable to inhibit B. cinerea infection indicating that UA secretion is critical for antagonistic activity.	1
Title: Activation of silent biosynthetic gene clusters using transcription factor decoys Abstract: Here we report a transcription factor decoy strategy for targeted activation of eight large silent polyketide synthase and non-ribosomal peptide synthetase gene clusters, ranging from 50 to 134 kilobases (kb) in multiple streptomycetes, and characterization of a novel oxazole family compound produced by a 98-kb biosynthetic gene cluster. Owing to its simplicity and ease of use, this strategy can be scaled up readily for discovery of natural products in streptomycetes.	1
Title: Perspectives of mitochondrial medicine Abstract: Mitochondrial medicine was established more than 50 years ago after discovery of the very first pathology caused by impaired mitochondria. Since then, more than 100 mitochondrial pathologies have been discovered. However, the number may be significantly higher if we interpret the term "mitochondrial medicine" more widely and include in these pathologies not only those determined by the genetic apparatus of the nucleus and mitochondria, but also acquired mitochondrial defects of non-genetic nature. Now the main problems of mitochondriology arise from methodology, this being due to studies of mitochondrial activities under different models and conditions that are far from the functioning of mitochondria in a cell, organ, or organism. Controversial behavior of mitochondria ("friends and foes") to some extent might be explained by their bacterial origin with possible preservation of "egoistic" features peculiar to bacteria. Apparently, for normal mitochondrial functioning it is essential to maintain homeostasis of a number of mitochondrial elements such as mitochondrial DNA structure, membrane potential, and the system of mitochondrial quality control. Abrogation of these elements can cause a number of pathologies that have become subjects of mitochondrial medicine. Some approaches to therapy of mitochondrial pathologies are discussed.	0
Title: DNA-scaffolded multivalent ligands to modulate cell function Abstract: We report a simple, versatile, multivalent ligand system that is capable of specifically and efficiently modulating cell-surface receptor clustering and function. The multivalent ligand is made of a polymeric DNA scaffold decorated with biorecognition ligands (i.e., antibodies) to interrogate and modulate cell receptor signaling and function. Using CD20 clustering-mediated apoptosis in B-cell cancer cells as a model system, we demonstrated that our multivalent ligand is significantly more effective at inducing apoptosis of target cancer cells than its monovalent counterpart. This multivalent DNA material approach represents a new chemical biology tool to interrogate cell receptor signaling and functions and to potentially manipulate such functions for the development of therapeutics.	0
Title: Effects of methanogenic inhibitors on methane production and abundances of methanogens and cellulolytic bacteria in in vitro ruminal cultures Abstract: The objective of this study was to systematically evaluate and compare the effects of select antimethanogen compounds on methane production, feed digestion and fermentation, and populations of ruminal bacteria and methanogens using in vitro cultures. Seven compounds, including 2-bromoethanesulphonate (BES), propynoic acid (PA), nitroethane (NE), ethyl trans-2-butenoate (ETB), 2-nitroethanol (2NEOH), sodium nitrate (SN), and ethyl-2-butynote (EB), were tested at a final concentration of 12 mM. Ground alfalfa hay was included as the only substrate to simulate daily forage intake. Compared to no-inhibitor controls, PA, 2NEOH, and SN greatly reduced the production of methane (70 to 99%), volatile fatty acids (VFAs; 46 to 66%), acetate (30 to 60%), and propionate (79 to 82%), with 2NEOH reducing the most. EB reduced methane production by 23% without a significant effect on total VFAs, acetate, or propionate. BES significantly reduced the propionate concentration but not the production of methane, total VFAs, or acetate. ETB or NE had no significant effect on any of the above-mentioned measurements. Specific quantitative-PCR (qPCR) assays showed that none of the inhibitors significantly affected total bacterial populations but that they did reduce the Fibrobacter succinogenes population. SN reduced the Ruminococcus albus population, while PA and 2NEOH increased the populations of both R. albus and Ruminococcus flavefaciens. Archaeon-specific PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) showed that all the inhibitors affected the methanogen population structure, while archaeon-specific qPCR revealed a significant decrease in methanogen population in all treatments. These results showed that EB, ETB, NE, and BES can effectively reduce the total population of methanogens but that they reduce methane production to a lesser extent. The results may guide future in vivo studies to develop effective mitigation of methane emission from ruminants.	0
Title: Deciphering the biosynthetic codes for the potent anti-SARS-CoV cyclodepsipeptide valinomycin in Streptomyces tsusimaensis ATCC 15141 Abstract: Valinomycin was recently reported to be the most potent agent against severe acute respiratory-syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in infected Vero E6 cells. Aimed at generating analogues by metabolic engineering, the valinomycin biosynthetic gene cluster has been cloned from Streptomyces tsusimaensis ATCC 15141. Targeted disruption of a nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) gene abolishes valinomycin production, which confirms its predicted nonribosomal-peptide origin. Sequence analysis of the NRPS system reveals four distinctive modules, two of which contain unusual domain organizations that are presumably involved in the generation of biosynthetic precursors D-alpha-hydroxyisovaleric acid and L-lactic acid. The respective adenylation domains in these two modules contain novel substrate-specificity-conferring codes that might specify for a class of hydroxyl acids for the biosynthesis of the depsipeptide natural products.	1
Title: Birth and migration of neurons in the central posterior/prepacemaker nucleus during adulthood in weakly electric knifefish (Eigenmannia sp.) Abstract: In contrast to mammals, fish maintain their capacity to generate neurons in the central nervous system even during adulthood for prolonged periods of life. By employing immunohistochemical, autoradiographic, and electron microscopic techniques, we studied such a postnatal neurogenesis within the complex of the central posterior/prepacemaker nucleus (CP/PPn) in knifefish (Eigenmannia sp.), a weakly electric teleost. The CP/PPn is a bilateral cluster of neurons in the thalamus. It controls frequency modulations of the electric organ discharge as they are used during social interactions. In the CP/PPn region adjacent to the wall of the third ventricle ("ventricular zone"), cells are born continuously and at high rates. They undergo multiple cell divisions before differentiating into neurons. Concomitant with this development, the newborn neurons migrate toward lateral regions of the CP/PPn. In the course of this lateral migration, they appear to acquire immunological and morphological characteristics that are typical for mature CP/PPn neurons. We hypothesize that at least some of the newly generated cells develop finally into functional CP/PPn neurons.	0
Title: Nine post-translational modifications during the biosynthesis of cinnamycin Abstract: Lantibiotics are ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified antimicrobial peptides that are characterized by the thioether cross-linked amino acids lanthionine (Lan) and methyllanthionine (MeLan). Cinnamycin is a 19 amino acid lantibiotic that contains one Lan and two MeLan. Cinnamycin also contains an unusual lysinoalanine (Lal) bridge formed from the ε-amino group of lysine 19 and a serine residue at position 6, and an erythro-3-hydroxy-L-aspartic acid resulting from the hydroxylation of L-aspartate at position 15. These modifications are critical in mediating the interactions of cinnamycin with its target, phosphatidylethanolamine. Recently, the cinnamycin biosynthetic gene cluster (cin) from Streptomyces cinnamoneus cinnamoneus DSM 40005 was reported. Herein, we investigated the biosynthetic machinery using both in vitro studies and heterologous expression in Escherichia coli. CinX is an α-ketoglutarate/iron(II)-dependent hydroxylase that carries out the hydroxylation of aspartate 15 of the precursor peptide CinA. In addition, CinM catalyzes dehydration of four Ser and Thr residues and subsequent cyclization of Cys residues to form the three (Me)Lan bridges. The order of the post-translational modifications catalyzed by CinM and CinX is interchangeable in vitro. CinX did not require the leader sequence at the N-terminus of CinA for activity, but the leader peptide was necessary for CinM function. Although CinM dehydrated serine 6, it did not catalyze the formation of Lal. A small protein encoded by cinorf7 is critical for the formation of the cross-link between Lys19 and dehydroalanine 6 as shown by coexpression studies of CinA, CinM, CinX, and Cinorf7 in E. coli.	1
Title: An asparagine oxygenase (AsnO) and a 3-hydroxyasparaginyl phosphotransferase (HasP) are involved in the biosynthesis of calcium-dependent lipopeptide antibiotics Abstract: Nonribosomal peptides contain a wide range of unusual non-proteinogenic amino acid residues. As a result, these complex natural products are amongst the most structurally diverse secondary metabolites in nature, and possess a broad spectrum of biological activities. beta-Hydroxylation of amino acid precursors or peptidyl residues and their subsequent processing by downstream tailoring enzymes are some of the most common themes in the biosynthetic diversification of these therapeutically important peptides. Identification and characterization of the biosynthetic intermediates and enzymes involved in these processes are thus pivotal in understanding nonribosomal peptide assembly and modification. To this end, the putative asparaginyl oxygenase- and 3-hydroxyasparaginyl phosphotransferase-encoding genes hasP and asnO were separately deleted from the calcium-dependent antibiotic (CDA) biosynthetic gene cluster of Streptomyces coelicolor. Whilst the parent strains produce a number of 3-hydroxyasparagine- and 3-phosphohydroxyasparagine-containing CDAs, the DeltahasP mutants produce exclusively non-phosphorylated CDAs. On the other hand, DeltaasnO mutants produce several new Asn-containing CDAs not present in the wild-type, which retain calcium-dependent antimicrobial activity. This confirms that AsnO and HasP are required for the beta-hydroxylation and phosphorylation of the Asn residue within CDA.	1
Title: Nickel-catalyzed cross-couplings of benzylic pivalates with arylboroxines: stereospecific formation of diarylalkanes and triarylmethanes Abstract: We have developed a stereospecific nickel-catalyzed cross-coupling of benzylic pivalates with arylboroxines. The success of this reaction relies on the use of Ni(cod)2 as the catalyst and NaOMe as a uniquely effective base. This reaction has broad scope with respect to the arylboroxine and benzylic pivalate, enabling the synthesis of a variety of diarylalkanes and triarylmethanes in good to excellent yields and ee's.	0
Title: Yak lactate dehydgogenase A4: purification, properties, and cDNA cloning Abstract: Lactate dehydrogenase A4 (LDH-A4) was purified for yak skeletal muscle. Michaelis constant (Km) analysis showed that yak LDH-A4 for pyruvate was significantly higher than that of cattle. cDNA cloning of LDH-A revealed two amino acid substitutions between yak and cattle. We suggest that the higher Km of yak LDH-A4 might be a result of molecular adaptation to a hypoxic environment.	0
Title: Ratiometric Detection of Glutathione Based on Disulfide Linkage Rupture between a FRET Coumarin Donor and a Rhodamine Acceptor Abstract: Abnormal levels of glutathione, a cellular antioxidant, can lead to a variety of diseases. We have constructed a near-infrared ratiometric fluorescent probe to detect glutathione concentrations in biological samples. The probe consists of a coumarin donor, which is connected through a disulfide-tethered linker to a rhodamine acceptor. Under the excitation of the coumarin donor at 405 nm, the probe shows weak visible fluorescence of the coumarin donor at 470 nm and strong near-infrared fluorescence of the rhodamine acceptor at 652 nm due to efficient Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) from the donor to the acceptor. Glutathione breaks the disulfide bond through reduction, which results in a dramatic increase in coumarin fluorescence and a corresponding decrease in rhodamine fluorescence. The probe possesses excellent cell permeability, biocompatibility, and good ratiometric fluorescence responses to glutathione and cysteine with a self-calibration capability. The probe was utilized to ratiometrically visualize glutathione concentration alterations in HeLa cells and Drosophila melanogaster larvae.	0
Title: Overexpression, purification and characterization of SimL, an amide synthetase involved in simocyclinone biosynthesis Abstract: Simocyclinone D8 is a potent inhibitor of bacterial gyrase, produced by Streptomyces antibioticus Tu 6040. It contains an aminocoumarin moiety, similar to that of novobiocin, which is linked by an amide bond to a structurally complex acyl moiety, consisting of an aromatic angucycline polyketide nucleus, the deoxysugar olivose and a tetraene dicarboxylic acid. We have now investigated the enzyme SimL, responsible for the formation of the amide bond of simocyclinone. The gene was cloned, expressed in S. lividans T7, and the protein was purified to near homogeneity, and characterized. The 60 kDa protein catalyzed both the ATP-dependent activation of the acyl component as well as its transfer to the amino group of the aminocoumarin ring, with no requirement for a 4'-phosphopantetheinyl cofactor. Besides its natural substrate, simocyclinone C4, SimL also accepted a range of cinnamic and benzoic acid derivatives and several other, structurally very diverse acids. These findings make SimL a possible tool for the creation of new aminocoumarin antibiotics.	1
Title: All-optical coherent population trapping with defect spin ensembles in silicon carbide Abstract: Divacancy defects in silicon carbide have long-lived electronic spin states and sharp optical transitions. Because of the various polytypes of SiC, hundreds of unique divacancies exist, many with spin properties comparable to the nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond. If ensembles of such spins can be all-optically manipulated, they make compelling candidate systems for quantum-enhanced memory, communication, and sensing applications. We report here direct all-optical addressing of basal plane-oriented divacancy spins in 4H-SiC. By means of magneto-spectroscopy, we fully identify the spin triplet structure of both the ground and the excited state, and use this for tuning of transition dipole moments between particular spin levels. We also identify a role for relaxation via intersystem crossing. Building on these results, we demonstrate coherent population trapping -a key effect for quantum state transfer between spins and photons- for divacancy sub-ensembles along particular crystal axes. These results, combined with the flexibility of SiC polytypes and device processing, put SiC at the forefront of quantum information science in the solid state.	0
Title: A control strategy to investigate the relationship between specific productivity and high-mannose glycoforms in CHO cells Abstract: The integration of physiological knowledge into process control strategies is a cornerstone for the improvement of biopharmaceutical cell culture technologies. The present contribution investigates the applicability of specific productivity as a physiological control parameter in a cell culture process producing a monoclonal antibody (mAb) in CHO cells. In order to characterize cell physiology, the on-line oxygen uptake rate (OUR) was monitored and the time-resolved specific productivity was calculated as physiological parameters. This characterization enabled to identify the tight link between the deprivation of tyrosine and the decrease in cell respiration and in specific productivity. Subsequently, this link was used to control specific productivity by applying different feeding profiles. The maintenance of specific productivity at various levels enabled to identify a correlation between the rate of product formation and the relative abundance of high-mannose glycoforms. An increase in high mannose content was assumed to be the result of high specific productivity. Furthermore, the high mannose content as a function of cultivation pH and specific productivity was investigated in a design of experiment approach. This study demonstrated how physiological parameters could be used to understand interactions between process parameters, physiological parameters, and product quality attributes.	0
Title: Structure and biosynthetic assembly of gulmirecins, macrolide antibiotics from the predatory bacterium Pyxidicoccus fallax Abstract: The gulmirecins constitute a new class of glycosylated macrolides that were isolated from the predatory bacterium Pyxidicoccus fallax HKI 727. Their structures were solved by a combination of NMR spectroscopic experiments and chemical derivatization. Analysis of the annotated gulmirecin gene cluster complemented the configurational assignment and provided insights into the stereochemical course of the biosynthetic assembly. The gulmirecins exhibit strong activity against staphylococci, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, but no cytotoxic effects on human cells.	1
Title: Free-Energy-Based Protein Design: Re-Engineering Cellular Retinoic Acid Binding Protein II Assisted by the Moveable-Type Approach Abstract: How to fine-tune the binding free energy of a small-molecule to a receptor site by altering the amino acid residue composition is a key question in protein engineering. Indeed, the ultimate solution to this problem, to chemical accuracy (±1 kcal/mol), will result in profound and wide-ranging applications in protein design. Numerous tools have been developed to address this question using knowledge-based models to more computationally intensive molecular dynamics simulations-based free energy calculations, but while some success has been achieved there remains room for improvement in terms of overall accuracy and in the speed of the methodology. Here we report a fast, knowledge-based movable-type (MT)-based approach to estimate the absolute and relative free energy of binding as influenced by mutations in a small-molecule binding site in a protein. We retrospectively validate our approach using mutagenesis data for retinoic acid binding to the Cellular Retinoic Acid Binding Protein II (CRABPII) system and then make prospective predictions that are borne out experimentally. The overall performance of our approach is supported by its success in identifying mutants that show high or even sub-nano-molar binding affinities of retinoic acid to the CRABPII system.	0
Title: Genome-based characterization of two prenylation steps in the assembly of the stephacidin and notoamide anticancer agents in a marine-derived Aspergillus sp Abstract: Stephacidin and notoamide natural products belong to a group of prenylated indole alkaloids containing a core bicyclo[2.2.2]diazaoctane ring system. These bioactive fungal secondary metabolites have a range of unusual structural and stereochemical features but their biosynthesis has remained uncharacterized. Herein, we report the first biosynthetic gene cluster for this class of fungal alkaloids based on whole genome sequencing of a marine-derived Aspergillus sp. Two central pathway enzymes catalyzing both normal and reverse prenyltransfer reactions were characterized in detail. Our results establish the early steps for creation of the prenylated indole alkaloid structure and suggest a scheme for the biosynthesis of stephacidin and notoamide metabolites. The work provides the first genetic and biochemical insights for understanding the structural diversity of this important family of fungal alkaloids.	1
Title: Dissecting the PhoP regulatory network of Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica Abstract: Genetic and genomic approaches have been successfully used to assign genes to distinct regulatory networks. However, the present challenge of distinguishing differentially regulated genes within a network is particularly hard because members of a given network tend to have similar regulatory features. We have addressed this challenge by developing a method, termed Gene Promoter Scan, that discriminates coregulated promoters by simultaneously considering both multiple cis promoter features and gene expression. Here, we apply this method to probe the regulatory networks governed by the PhoP/PhoQ two-component system in the enteric bacteria Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica. Our analysis uncovered members of the PhoP regulon and interactions with other regulatory systems that were not discovered in previous approaches. The predictions made by Gene Promoter Scan were experimentally validated to establish that the PhoP protein uses multiple mechanisms to control gene transcription, regulates acid resistance determinants, and is a central element in a highly connected network.	0
Title: DNA polymerase delta isolated from Schizosaccharomyces pombe contains five subunits Abstract: DNA polymerase delta (pol delta) plays an essential role in DNA replication, repair, and recombination. We have purified pol delta from Schizosaccharomyces pombe more than 10(3)-fold and demonstrated that the polymerase activity of purified S. pombe pol delta is completely dependent on proliferating cell nuclear antigen and replication factor C. SDS/PAGE analysis of the purified fraction indicated that the pol delta complex consists of five subunits that migrate with apparent molecular masses of 125, 55, 54, 42, and 22 kDa. Western blot analysis indicated that the 125, 55, and 54 kDa proteins are the large catalytic subunit (Pol3), Cdc1, and Cdc27, respectively. The identity of the other two subunits, p42 and p22, was determined following proteolytic digestion and sequence analysis of the resulting peptides. The peptide sequences derived from the p22 subunit indicated that this subunit is identical to Cdm1, previously identified as a multicopy suppressor of the temperature-sensitive cdc1-P13 mutant, whereas peptide sequences derived from the p42 subunit were identical to a previously uncharacterized ORF located on S. pombe chromosome 1.	0
Title: Cloning and characterization of a polyketide synthase gene from Streptomyces fradiae Tü2717, which carries the genes for biosynthesis of the angucycline antibiotic urdamycin A and a gene probably involved in its oxygenation Abstract: A DNA fragment was cloned as cosmid purd8, which encodes a polyketide synthase involved in the production of the angucycline antibiotic urdamycin from Streptomyces fradiae Tü2717. Deletion of the polyketide synthase genes from the chromosome abolished urdamycin production. In addition, purd8 conferred urdamycin resistance on introduction into Streptomyces lividans TK24. Sequence analysis of 5.7 kb of purd8 revealed six open reading frames transcribed in the same direction. The deduced amino acid sequences of the six open reading frames strongly resemble proteins from known type II polyketide synthase gene clusters: a ketoacyl synthase, a chain length factor, an acyl carrier protein, a ketoreductase, a cyclase, and an oxygenase. Heterologous expression of the urdamycin genes encoding a ketoacyl synthase and a chain length factor in Streptomyces glaucescens tetracenomycin C-nonproducing mutants impaired in either the TcmK ketoacyl synthase or TcmL chain length factor resulted in the production of tetracenomycin C. Heterologous expression of a putative oxygenase gene from the urdamycin gene cluster in S. glaucescens GLA.O caused production of the hybrid antibiotic 6-hydroxy tetracenomycin C.	1
Title: An antifungal polyketide associated with horizontally acquired genes supports symbiont-mediated defense in Lagria villosa beetles Abstract: Microbial symbionts are often a source of chemical novelty and can contribute to host defense against antagonists. However, the ecological relevance of chemical mediators remains unclear for most systems. Lagria beetles live in symbiosis with multiple strains of Burkholderia bacteria that protect their offspring against pathogens. Here, we describe the antifungal polyketide lagriamide, and provide evidence supporting that it is produced by an uncultured symbiont, Burkholderia gladioli Lv-StB, which is dominant in field-collected Lagria villosa. Interestingly, lagriamide is structurally similar to bistramides, defensive compounds found in marine tunicates. We identify a gene cluster that is probably involved in lagriamide biosynthesis, provide evidence for horizontal acquisition of these genes, and show that the naturally occurring symbiont strains on the egg are protective in the soil environment. Our findings highlight the potential of microbial symbionts and horizontal gene transfer as influential sources of ecological innovation.	1
Title: A novel lantibiotic acting on bacterial cell wall synthesis produced by the uncommon actinomycete Planomonospora sp Abstract: Important classes of antibiotics acting on bacterial cell wall biosynthesis, such as beta-lactams and glycopeptides, are used extensively in therapy and are now faced with a challenge because of the progressive spread of resistant pathogens. A discovery program was devised to target novel peptidoglycan biosynthesis inhibitors capable of overcoming these resistance mechanisms. The microbial products were first screened according to their differential activity against Staphylococcus aureus and its L-form. Then, activities insensitive to the addition of a beta-lactamase cocktail or d-alanyl-d-alanine affinity resin were selected. Thirty-five lantibiotics were identified from a library of broth extracts produced by 40,000 uncommon actinomycetes. Five of them showed structural characteristics that did not match with any known microbial metabolite. In this study, we report on the production, structure determination, and biological activity of one of these novel lantibiotics, namely, planosporicin, which is produced by the uncommon actinomycete Planomonospora sp. Planosporicin is a 2194 Da polypeptide originating from 24 proteinogenic amino acids. It contains lanthionine and methyllanthionine amino acids generating five intramolecular thioether bridges. Planosporicin selectively blocks peptidoglycan biosynthesis and causes accumulation of UDP-linked peptidoglycan precursors in growing bacterial cells. On the basis of its mode of action and globular structure, planosporicin can be assigned to the mersacidin (20 amino acids, 1825 Da) and the actagardine (19 amino acids, 1890 Da) subgroup of type B lantibiotics. Considering its spectrum of activity against Gram-positive pathogens of medical importance, including multi-resistant clinical isolates, and its efficacy in vivo, planosporicin represents a potentially new antibiotic to treat emerging pathogens.	1
Title: Competition for delivery of profilin-actin to barbed ends limits the rate of formin-mediated actin filament elongation Abstract: Formins direct the elongation of unbranched actin filaments by binding their barbed ends and processively stepping onto incoming actin monomers to incorporate them into the filament. Binding of profilin to actin monomers creates profilin-actin complexes, which then bind polyproline tracts located in formin homology 1 (FH1) domains. Diffusion of these natively disordered domains enables direct delivery of profilin-actin to the barbed end, speeding the rate of filament elongation. In this study, we investigated the mechanism of coordinated actin delivery from the multiple polyproline tracts in formin FH1 domains. We found that each polyproline tract can efficiently mediate polymerization, but that all tracts do not generate the same rate of elongation. In WT FH1 domains, the multiple polyproline tracts compete to deliver profilin-actin to the barbed end. This competition ultimately limits the rate of formin-mediated elongation. We propose that intrinsic properties of the filament-binding FH2 domain tune the efficiency of FH1-mediated elongation by directly regulating the rate of monomer incorporation at the barbed end. A strong correlation between competitive FH1-mediated profilin-actin delivery and FH2-regulated gating of the barbed end effectively limits the elongation rate, thereby obviating the need for evolutionary optimization of FH1 domain sequences.	0
Title: Catalytic Enantioselective Carbon-Oxygen Bond Formation: Phosphine-Catalyzed Synthesis of Benzylic Ethers via the Oxidation of Benzylic C-H Bonds Abstract: Benzylic alcohols and ethers are common subunits in bioactive molecules, as well as useful intermediates in organic chemistry. In this Communication, we describe a new approach to the enantioselective synthesis of benzylic ethers through the chiral phosphine-catalyzed coupling of two readily available partners, γ-aryl-substituted alkynoates and alcohols, under mild conditions. In this process, the alkynoate partner undergoes an internal redox reaction. Specifically, the benzylic position is oxidized with good enantioselectivity, and the alkyne is reduced to the alkene.	0
Title: Deciphering indolocarbazole and enediyne aminodideoxypentose biosynthesis through comparative genomics: insights from the AT2433 biosynthetic locus Abstract: AT2433, an indolocarbazole antitumor antibiotic, is structurally distinguished by its aminodideoxypentose-containing disaccharide and asymmetrically halogenated N-methylated aglycon. Cloning and sequence analysis of AT2433 gene cluster and comparison of this locus with that encoding for rebeccamycin and the gene cluster encoding calicheamicin present an opportunity to study the aminodideoxypentose biosynthesis via comparative genomics. The locus was confirmed via in vitro biochemical characterization of two methyltransferases--one common to AT2433 and rebeccamycin, the other unique to AT2433--as well as via heterologous expression and in vivo bioconversion experiments using the AT2433 N-glycosyltransferase. Preliminary studies of substrate tolerance for these three enzymes reveal the potential to expand upon the enzymatic diversification of indolocarbazoles. Moreover, this work sets the stage for future studies regarding the origins of the indolocarbazole maleimide nitrogen and indolocarbazole asymmetry.	1
Title: Nickel-catalyzed carbon-carbon bond-forming reactions of unactivated tertiary alkyl halides: Suzuki arylations Abstract: The first Suzuki cross-couplings of unactivated tertiary alkyl electrophiles are described. The method employs a readily accessible catalyst (NiBr(2)·diglyme/4,4'-di-tert-butyl-2,2'-bipyridine, both commercially available) and represents the initial example of the use of a group 10 catalyst to cross-couple unactivated tertiary electrophiles to form C-C bonds. This approach to the synthesis of all-carbon quaternary carbon centers does not suffer from isomerization of the alkyl group, in contrast with the umpolung strategy for this bond construction (cross-coupling of a tertiary alkylmetal with an aryl electrophile). Preliminary mechanistic studies are consistent with the generation of a radical intermediate along the reaction pathway.	0
Title: A novel photoredox-active group for the generation of fluorinated radicals from difluorostyrenes Abstract: A 4-tetrafluoropyridinylthio group was suggested as a new photoredox-active moiety. The group can be directly installed on difluorostyrenes in a single step by the thiolene click reaction. It proceeds upon visible light catalysis with 9-phenylacridine providing various difluorinated sulfides as radical precursors. Single electron reduction of the C-S bond with the formation of fluoroalkyl radicals is enabled by the electron-poor azine ring. The intermediate difluorinated sulfides were involved in a series of photoredox reactions with silyl enol ethers, alkenes, nitrones and an alkenyl trifluoroborate.	0
Title: Electron paramagnetic resonance measurements of free radicals in the intact beating heart: a technique for detection and characterization of free radicals in whole biological tissues Abstract: Free radicals have been hypothesized to be important mediators of disease in a variety of organs and tissues. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy can be applied to directly measure free radicals; however, it has not been possible to measure important biological radicals in situ because conventional spectrometer designs are not suitable for the performance of measurements on whole organs or tissues. We report the development of an EPR spectrometer designed for optimum performance in measuring free radicals in intact biological organs or tissues. This spectrometer consists of a 1- to 2-GHz microwave bridge with the source locked to the resonant frequency of a recessed gap loop-gap resonator. With this spectrometer, radical concentrations as low as 0.4 microM can be measured. Isolated beating hearts were studied in which simultaneous real time measurements of free radicals and cardiac contractile function were performed. This in vivo EPR technique was applied to study the kinetics of free radical uptake and metabolism in normally perfused and globally ischemic hearts. In addition, we show that this technique can be used to noninvasively measure tissue oxygen consumption. Thus, it is demonstrated that EPR spectroscopy can be applied to directly measure in vivo free radical metabolism and tissue oxygen consumption. This technique offers great promise in the study of in vivo free radical generation and the effects of this radical generation on whole biological tissues.	0
Title: Syntheses of chloroisosulochrin and isosulochrin and biomimetic elaboration to maldoxin, maldoxone, dihydromaldoxin, and dechlorodihydromaldoxin Abstract: An efficient synthesis of chloroisosulochrin was accomplished using a novel ortho-selective chlorination of a phenol with sulfuryl chloride and 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine as the key step. Further elaboration by a biomimetic route converted chloroisosulochrin to dihydromaldoxin, maldoxone (lactone formed by dehydration of dihydromaldoxin), and maldoxin and isosulochrin to dechlorodihydromaldoxin and dechloromaldoxin.	0
Title: AL072, a novel anti-Legionella antibiotic produced by Streptomyces sp Abstract: AL072 is a potent anti-Legionella antibiotic produced by Streptomyces strain AL91. The compound was isolated from the fermentation broth with 1 volume of isopropyl alcohol, followed by an ethyl acetate extraction and subsequent concentration under reduced pressure. Purification was performed on an octadecyl silica gel column followed by preparative HPLC. AL072 purified as mentioned above showed extremely specific activity only towards Legionella pneumophila. No antibacterial activity against any other bacteria tested was demonstrable. Its molecular weight was determined by FAB-MS (m/z 648) and the compound was identified as a novel 1,3-diacyl glycerol with the molecular formula C41H76O5. One of the two acyl groups is linoleyl and the other is 3,5-dimethyl octadecanoyl.	0
Title: Orthogonal Peptide-Templated Labeling Elucidates Lateral ETA R/ETB R Proximity and Reveals Altered Downstream Signaling Abstract: Fine-tuning of G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling is important to maintain cellular homeostasis. Recent studies demonstrated that lateral GPCR interactions in the cell membrane can impact signaling profiles. Here, we report on a one-step labeling method of multiple membrane-embedded GPCRs. Based on short peptide tags, complementary probes transfer the cargo (e. g. a fluorescent dye) by an acyl transfer reaction with high spatial and temporal resolution within 5 min. We applied this approach to four receptors of the cardiovascular system: the endothelin receptor A and B (ETA R and ETB R), angiotensin II receptor type 1, and apelin. Wild type-like G protein activation after N-terminal modification was demonstrated for all receptor species. Using FRET-competent dyes, a constitutive proximity between hetero-receptors was limited to ETA R/ETB R. Further, we demonstrate, that ETA R expression regulates the signaling of co-expressed ETB R. Our orthogonal peptide-templated labeling of different GPCRs provides novel insight into the regulation of GPCR signaling.	0
Title: Formicamycins, antibacterial polyketides produced by Streptomyces formicae isolated from African Tetraponera plant-ants Abstract: We report a new Streptomyces species named S. formicae that was isolated from the African fungus-growing plant-ant Tetraponera penzigi and show that it produces novel pentacyclic polyketides that are active against MRSA and VRE. The chemical scaffold of these compounds, which we have called the formicamycins, is similar to the fasamycins identified from the heterologous expression of clones isolated from environmental DNA, but has significant differences that allow the scaffold to be decorated with up to four halogen atoms. We report the structures and bioactivities of 16 new molecules and show, using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing, that biosynthesis of these compounds is encoded by a single type 2 polyketide synthase biosynthetic gene cluster in the S. formicae genome. Our work has identified the first antibiotic from the Tetraponera system and highlights the benefits of exploring unusual ecological niches for new actinomycete strains and novel natural products.	1
Title: Measurement of superoxide-derived free radicals in the reperfused heart. Evidence for a free radical mechanism of reperfusion injury Abstract: There has been considerable controversy regarding the role of oxygen free radicals as important mediators of cell damage in reperfused myocardium. This controversy regards whether superoxide and hydroxyl free radicals are generated on reperfusion and if these radicals actually cause impaired contractile function. In this study, EPR studies using the spin trap 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyroline-n-oxide (DMPO) demonstrate the formation of .OH and R. free radicals in the reperfused heart. EPR signals of DMPO-OH, aN = aH = 14.9 G, and DMPO-R aN = 15.8 G aH = 22.8 G are observed, with peak concentrations during the first minute of reperfusion. It is demonstrated that these radicals are derived from .O2- since reperfusion in the presence of enzymatically active recombinant human superoxide dismutase markedly reduced the formation of these signals while inactive recombinant human superoxide dismutase had no effect. On reperfusion with perfusate pretreated to remove adventitial iron, the concentration of the DMPO-OH signal was increased 2-fold and a 4-fold decrease in the DMPO-R signal was observed demonstrating that iron-mediated Fenton chemistry occurs. Hearts reperfused with recombinant human superoxide dismutase exhibited improved contractile function in parallel with the marked reduction in measured free radicals. In order to determine if the reperfusion free radical burst results in impaired contractile function, simultaneous measurements of free radical generation and contractile function were performed. A direct relationship between free radical generation and subsequent impaired contractile function was observed. These studies suggest that superoxide derived .OH and R. free radicals are generated in the reperfused heart via Fenton chemistry. These radicals appear to be key mediators of myocardial reperfusion injury.	0
Title: Ribosomally derived lipopeptides containing distinct fatty acyl moieties Abstract: Lipopeptides represent a large group of microbial natural products that include important antibacterial and antifungal drugs and some of the most-powerful known biosurfactants. The vast majority of lipopeptides comprise cyclic peptide backbones N-terminally equipped with various fatty acyl moieties. The known compounds of this type are biosynthesized by nonribosomal peptide synthetases, giant enzyme complexes that assemble their products in a non-gene-encoded manner. Here, we report the genome-guided discovery of ribosomally derived, fatty-acylated lipopeptides, termed selidamides. Heterologous reconstitution of three pathways, two from cyanobacteria and one from an arctic, ocean-derived alphaproteobacterium, allowed structural characterization of the probable natural products and suggest that selidamides are widespread over various bacterial phyla. The identified representatives feature cyclic peptide moieties and fatty acyl units attached to (hydroxy)ornithine or lysine side chains by maturases of the GCN5-related N-acetyltransferase superfamily. In contrast to nonribosomal lipopeptides that are usually produced as congener mixtures, the three selidamides are selectively fatty acylated with C10, C12, or C16 fatty acids, respectively. These results highlight the ability of ribosomal pathways to emulate products with diverse, nonribosomal-like features and add to the biocatalytic toolbox for peptide drug improvement and targeted discovery.	1
Title: Mannitol is essential for the development of stress-resistant ascospores in Neosartorya fischeri (Aspergillus fischeri) Abstract: The polyol mannitol is one of the main compatible solutes in Neosartorya fischeri and accumulates in conidia and ascospores. Here, it is shown that biosynthesis of mannitol in N. fischeri mainly depends on mannitol 1-phosphate dehydrogenase (MpdA). Reporter studies and qPCR analysis demonstrated that mpdA is moderately expressed in vegetative hyphae and conidiophores, while it is highly expressed during development of ascospores. Deletion of mpdA reduced mannitol in whole cultures as much as 85% of the wild type, while trehalose levels had increased more than 4-fold. Decreased mannitol accumulation had no effect on mycelial growth irrespective of heat- or oxidative stress. Notably, conidia of the ΔmpdA strain had higher mannitol and lower trehalose levels. They were more sensitive to heat stress. The most distinct phenotype of mpdA deletion was the absence of full development of ascospores. Formation of cleistothecia, and asci was not affected. The ascus cell wall, however, did not dissolve and asci contained incompletely formed or aborted ascospores. Addition of the Mpd inhibitor nitrophenide to the wild type strain also resulted in disturbed ascospore formation. Taken together, these results show that mannitol has a role in sexual development of N. fischeri and in stress resistance of conidia.	0
Title: Genome sequence of the human- and animal-pathogenic strain Nocardia cyriacigeorgica GUH-2 Abstract: The pathogenic strain Nocardia cyriacigeorgica GUH-2 was isolated from a fatal human nocardiosis case, and its genome was sequenced. The complete genomic sequence of this strain contains 6,194,645 bp, an average G+C content of 68.37%, and no plasmids. We also identified several protein-coding genes to which N. cyriacigeorgica's virulence can potentially be attributed.	0
Title: A gut-to-brain signal of fluid osmolarity controls thirst satiation Abstract: Satiation is the process by which eating and drinking reduce appetite. For thirst, oropharyngeal cues have a critical role in driving satiation by reporting to the brain the volume of fluid that has been ingested1-12. By contrast, the mechanisms that relay the osmolarity of ingested fluids remain poorly understood. Here we show that the water and salt content of the gastrointestinal tract are precisely measured and then rapidly communicated to the brain to control drinking behaviour in mice. We demonstrate that this osmosensory signal is necessary and sufficient for satiation during normal drinking, involves the vagus nerve and is transmitted to key forebrain neurons that control thirst and vasopressin secretion. Using microendoscopic imaging, we show that individual neurons compute homeostatic need by integrating this gastrointestinal osmosensory information with oropharyngeal and blood-borne signals. These findings reveal how the fluid homeostasis system monitors the osmolarity of ingested fluids to dynamically control drinking behaviour.	0
Title: Enduracidin analogues with altered halogenation patterns produced by genetically engineered strains of Streptomyces fungicidicus Abstract: Enduracidins (1, 2) and ramoplanin (3) are structurally and functionally closely related lipodepsipeptide antibiotics. They are active against multi-drug-resistant Gram-positive pathogens, including MRSA. Each peptide contains one chlorinated non-proteinogenic amino acid residue, Cl(2)-Hpg or Cl-Hpg. To investigate the timing of halogenation and the importance of chlorination on bioactivity and bioavailability of enduracidin, and to probe the substrate specificity and portability of the ramoplanin halogenase, we constructed the mutant strain SfDelta30 in which the enduracidin halogenase gene orf30 had been deleted and complemented it with the ramoplanin counterpart orf20. We also expressed orf20 in the enduracidin wild-type producer. Metabolite analysis revealed SfDelta30 produced the novel analogues dideschloroenduracidins A (4) and B (5), while the recombinant strains SfDelta30R20 and SfR20 produced monodeschloroenduracidins A (6) and B (7) and a trichlorinated enduracidin (8), respectively. In addition, orf30 self-complementation yielded the strain SfDelta30E30, which is capable of producing six peptides including 6 and 7. MS/MS analysis positioned the single chlorine atom in 6 at Hpg(13) and localized the third chlorine atom in 8 to Hpg(11). Biological evaluation of these enduracidin analogues indicated that all retained activity against Staphylococcus aureus. Our findings lay the foundation for further utilization of enduracidin and ramoplanin halogenases in combinatorial biosynthesis.	0
Title: Characterization of CmaA, an adenylation-thiolation didomain enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of coronatine Abstract: Several pathovars of Pseudomonas syringae produce the phytotoxin coronatine (COR), which contains an unusual amino acid, the 1-amino-2-ethylcyclopropane carboxylic acid called coronamic acid (CMA), which is covalently linked to a polyketide-derived carboxylic acid, coronafacic acid, by an amide bond. The region of the COR biosynthetic gene cluster proposed to be responsible for CMA biosynthesis was resequenced, and errors in previously deposited cmaA sequences were corrected. These efforts allowed overproduction of P. syringae pv. glycinea PG4180 CmaA in P. syringae pv. syringae FF5 as a FLAG-tagged protein and overproduction of P. syringae pv. tomato CmaA in Escherichia coli as a His-tagged protein; both proteins were in an enzymatically active form. Sequence analysis of CmaA indicated that there were two domains, an adenylation domain (A domain) and a thiolation domain (T domain). ATP-(32)PP(i) exchange assays showed that the A domain of CmaA catalyzes the conversion of branched-chain L-amino acids and ATP into the corresponding aminoacyl-AMP derivatives, with a kinetic preference for L-allo-isoleucine. Additional experiments demonstrated that the T domain of CmaA, which is posttranslationally modified with a 4'-phosphopantetheinyl group, reacts with the AMP derivative of L-allo-isoleucine to produce an aminoacyl thiolester intermediate. This covalent species was detected by incubating CmaA with ATP and L-[G-(3)H]allo-isoleucine, followed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis. It is postulated that the L-allo-isoleucine covalently tethered to CmaA serves as the substrate for additional enzymes in the CMA biosynthetic pathway that catalyze cyclopropane ring formation, which is followed by thiolester hydrolysis, yielding free CMA. The availability of catalytically active CmaA should facilitate elucidation of the details of the subsequent steps in the formation of this novel cyclopropyl amino acid.	1
Title: Genomics-driven discovery of PKS-NRPS hybrid metabolites from Aspergillus nidulans Abstract: In the postgenomic era it has become increasingly apparent that the vast number of predicted biosynthesis genes of microorganisms is not reflected by the metabolic profile observed under standard fermentation conditions. In the absence of a particular (in most cases unknown) trigger these gene loci remain silent. Because these cryptic gene clusters may code for the biosynthesis of important virulence factors, toxins, or even drug candidates, new strategies for their activation are urgently needed to make use of this largely untapped reservoir of potentially bioactive compounds. The discovery of new microbial metabolites through genome mining has proven to be a very promising approach. Even so, the investigation of silent gene clusters is still a substantial challenge, particularly in fungi. Here we report a new strategy for the successful induction of a silent metabolic pathway in the important model organism Aspergillus nidulans, which led to the discovery of novel PKS-NRPS hybrid metabolites.	1
Title: Quantification of uncultured Ruminococcus obeum-like bacteria in human fecal samples by fluorescent in situ hybridization and flow cytometry using 16S rRNA-targeted probes Abstract: A 16S rRNA-targeted probe was designed and validated in order to quantify the number of uncultured Ruminococcus obeum-like bacteria by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH). These bacteria have frequently been found in 16S ribosomal DNA clone libraries prepared from bacterial communities in the human intestine. Thirty-two reference strains from the human intestine, including a phylogenetically related strain and strains of some other Ruminococcus species, were used as negative controls and did not hybridize with the new probe. Microscopic and flow cytometric analyses revealed that a group of morphologically similar bacteria in feces did hybridize with this probe. Moreover, it was found that all hybridizing cells also hybridized with a probe specific for the Clostridium coccoides-Eubacterium rectale group, a group that includes the uncultured R. obeum-like bacteria. Quantification of the uncultured R. obeum-like bacteria and the C. coccoides-E. rectale group by flow cytometry and microscopy revealed that these groups comprised approximately 2.5 and 16% of the total community in fecal samples, respectively. The uncultured R. obeum-like bacteria comprise about 16% of the C. coccoides-E. rectale group. These results indicate that the uncultured R. obeum-like bacteria are numerically important in human feces. Statistical analysis revealed no significant difference between the microscopic and flow cytometric counts and the different feces sampling times, while a significant host-specific effect on the counts was observed. Our data demonstrate that the combination of FISH and flow cytometry is a useful approach for studying the ecology of uncultured bacteria in the human gastrointestinal tract.	0
Title: The Biosynthesis of Rare Homo-Amino Acid Containing Variants of Microcystin by a Benthic Cyanobacterium Abstract: Microcystins are a family of chemically diverse hepatotoxins produced by distantly related cyanobacteria and are potent inhibitors of eukaryotic protein phosphatases 1 and 2A. Here we provide evidence for the biosynthesis of rare variants of microcystin that contain a selection of homo-amino acids by the benthic strain Phormidium sp. LP904c. This strain produces at least 16 microcystin chemical variants many of which contain homophenylalanine or homotyrosine. We retrieved the complete 54.2 kb microcystin (mcy) gene cluster from a draft genome assembly. Analysis of the substrate specificity of McyB1 and McyC adenylation domain binding pockets revealed divergent substrate specificity sequences, which could explain the activation of homo-amino acids which were present in 31% of the microcystins detected and included variants such as MC-LHty, MC-HphHty, MC-LHph and MC-HphHph. The mcy gene cluster did not encode enzymes for the synthesis of homo-amino acids but may instead activate homo-amino acids produced during the synthesis of anabaenopeptins. We observed the loss of microcystin during cultivation of a closely related strain, Phormidium sp. DVL1003c. This study increases the knowledge of benthic cyanobacterial strains that produce microcystin variants and broadens the structural diversity of known microcystins.	1
Title: Dual control of subtilin biosynthesis and immunity in Bacillus subtilis Abstract: The production of the peptide antibiotic (lantibiotic) subtilin in Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6633 is highly regulated. Transcriptional organization and regulation of the subtilin gene cluster encompassing 11 genes was characterized. Two polycistronic mRNAs encoding transcript spaBTC (6.8 kb) and encoding transcript spaIFEG (3.5 kb) as well as the monocistronic spaS (0.3 kb) mRNA were shown by Northern hybridization. Primer extension experiments and beta-galactosidase fusions confirmed three independent promoter sites preceding genes spaB, spaS and spaI. beta-Galactosidase expression of spaB, spaS and spaI promoter lacZ fusions initiated in mid-exponential growth. Maximal activities were reached at the transition to stationary growth and were collinear with subtilin production. The lacZ activity was dependent on co-expression with the two-component regulatory system spaRK. The presence of subtilin was needed for efficient expression of all three promoter lacZ fusions. This suggests a transcriptional autoregulation according to a quorum-sensing mechanism with subtilin as autoinducer and signal transduction via SpaRK. Additionally, spaR expression was found to be under positive control of the alternative sigma factor H. Deletion of sigma H strongly decreased subtilin production. Full subtilin production could be restored after in-trans complementation of spaR. Deletion of the major B. subtilis transition state regulator AbrB strongly increased subtilin production. These results show that the spaRK two-component regulatory system, and hence subtilin biosynthesis and immunity, is under dual control of two independent regulatory systems: autoinduction via subtilin and transcriptional regulation via sigma factor H.	1
Title: Identification of micromonolactam, a new polyene macrocyclic lactam from two marine Micromonospora strains using chemical and molecular methods: clarification of the biosynthetic pathway from a glutamate starter unit Abstract: Through a combination of chemical and molecular analysis, a new polyene macrolactam named micromonolactam was obtained from two marine-derived Micromonospora species. This new polyene metabolite is a constitutional isomer of salinilactam A but contains a different polyene pattern and one cis double bond, in contrast to the all trans structure reported for salinilactam A. The molecular analysis data also established that micromonolactam is a hybrid polyketide derived from 11 polyketide units and a modified glutamate starter unit.	1
Title: High-level genomic integration, epigenetic changes, and expression of sleeping beauty transgene Abstract: Sleeping Beauty transposon (SB-Tn) has emerged as an important nonviral vector for integrating transgenes into mammalian genomes. We report here a novel dual fluorescent reporter cis SB-Tn system that permitted nonselective fluorescent-activated cell sorting for SB-Tn-transduced K562 erythroid cells. Using an internal ribosome entry site element, the green fluorescent protein (eGFP) was linked to the SB10 transposase gene as an indirect marker for the robust expression of SB10 transposase. Flourescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) by eGFP resulted in significant enrichment (>60%) of cells exhibiting SB-Tn-mediated genomic insertions and long-term expression of a DsRed transgene. The hybrid erythroid-specific promoter of DsRed transgene was verified in erythroid or megakaryocyte differentiation of K562 cells. Bisulfite-mediated genomic analyses identified different DNA methylation patterns between DsRed(+) and DsRed(-) cell clones, suggesting a critical role in transgene expression. Moreover, although the host genomic copy of the promoter element showed no CpG methylation, the same sequence carried by the transgene was markedly hypermethylated. Additional evidence also suggested a role for histone deacetylation in the regulation of DsRed transgene. The presence of SB transgene affected the expression of neighboring host genes at distances >45 kb. Our data suggested that a fluorescent reporter cis SB-Tn system can be used to enrich mammalian cells harboring SB-mediated transgene insertions. The observed epigenetic changes also demonstrated that transgenes inserted by SB could be selectively modified by endogenous factors. In addition, long-range activation of host genes must now be recognized as a potential consequence of an inserted transgene cassette containing enhancer elements.	0
Title: The developmentally regulated Aspergillus nidulans wA gene encodes a polypeptide homologous to polyketide and fatty acid synthases Abstract: The Aspergillus nidulans wA gene is required for synthesis of a green pigment present in the walls of mature asexual spores (conidia); wA mutants produce colorless (white) conidia. We determined the transcriptional structure and DNA sequence of the wA gene. wA consists of 5 exons separated by short (40-60 bp) introns. The processed transcript has the potential to encode a protein consisting of 1986 amino acid residues. The predicted WA polypeptide showed extensive sequence similarities with bacterial and fungal polyketide synthases and vertebrate fatty acid synthases, particularly within conserved active sites. Properties of the yellow conidial wall pigment intermediate suggest that it is a polyketide rather than a fatty acid. It is therefore likely that wA encodes all or part of a polyketide synthase involved in the formation of this pigment intermediate.	1
Title: Evernimicin binds exclusively to the 50S ribosomal subunit and inhibits translation in cell-free systems derived from both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria Abstract: Evernimicin (SCH 27899) is a new antibiotic with activity against a wide spectrum of gram-positive bacteria and activity against some gram-negative bacteria. Previous metabolic labeling studies indicated that evernimicin specifically inhibited protein synthesis in Staphylococcus aureus. Using a susceptible Escherichia coli strain, we demonstrated that evernimicin also inhibited protein synthesis in E. coli. In cell-free translation assays with extracts from either E. coli or S. aureus, evernimicin had a 50% inhibitory concentration of approximately 125 nM. In contrast, cell-free systems derived from wheat germ and rabbit reticulocytes were inhibited only by very high levels of evernimicin. Evernimicin did not promote transcript misreading. [(14)C]evernimicin specifically bound to the 50S subunit from E. coli. Nonlinear regression analysis of binding data generated with 70S ribosomes from E. coli and S. aureus and 50S subunits from E. coli returned dissociation constants of 84, 86, and 160 nM, respectively. In binding experiments, performed in the presence of excess quantities of a selection of antibiotics known to bind to the 50S subunit, only the structurally similar drug avilamycin blocked binding of [(14)C]evernimicin to ribosomes.	1
Title: Discovery of a two-component monooxygenase SnoaW/SnoaL2 involved in nogalamycin biosynthesis Abstract: Nogalamycin is an anthracycline polyketide antibiotic that contains two deoxysugars, at positions C-1 and C-7. Previous biosynthetic studies conducted in vivo affiliated snoaL2 with an unusual C-1 hydroxylation reaction, but in vitro activity was not established. Here, we demonstrate that inactivation of either snoaL2 or snoaW resulted in accumulation of two nonhydroxylated metabolites, nogalamycinone and a novel anthracycline 3',4'-demethoxy-nogalose-nogalamycinone. The C-1 hydroxylation activity was successfully reconstructed in vitro in the presence of the two enzymes, NAD(P)H and the substrates. Based on relative reaction efficiencies, 3',4'-demethoxy-nogalose-nogalamycinone was identified as the likely natural substrate. A biosynthetic model was established where the atypical short-chain alcohol dehydrogenase SnoaW reduces the anthraquinone to a dihydroquinone using NADPH, which enables activation of oxygen and formation of a hydroperoxy intermediate. Finally, protonation of the intermediate by SnoaL2 yields the 1-hydroxylated product.	1
Title: Deciphering tuberactinomycin biosynthesis: isolation, sequencing, and annotation of the viomycin biosynthetic gene cluster Abstract: The tuberactinomycin antibiotics are essential components in the drug arsenal against Mycobacterium tuberculosis infections and are specifically used for the treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. These antibiotics are also being investigated for their targeting of the catalytic RNAs involved in viral replication and for the treatment of bacterial infections caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains and vancomycin-resistant enterococci. We report on the isolation, sequencing, and annotation of the biosynthetic gene cluster for one member of this antibiotic family, viomycin, from Streptomyces sp. strain ATCC 11861. This is the first gene cluster for a member of the tuberactinomycin family of antibiotics sequenced, and the information gained can be extrapolated to all members of this family. The gene cluster covers 36.3 kb of DNA and encodes 20 open reading frames that we propose are involved in the biosynthesis, regulation, export, and activation of viomycin, in addition to self-resistance to the antibiotic. These results enable us to predict the metabolic logic of tuberactinomycin production and begin steps toward the combinatorial biosynthesis of these antibiotics to complement existing chemical modification techniques to produce novel tuberactinomycin derivatives.	1
Title: Simultaneous determination of the total number of aquatic bacteria and the number thereof involved in respiration Abstract: The electron transport system of respiring organisms reduces 2-(p-iodophenyl)-3-(p-nitrophenyl)-5-phenyl tetrazolium chloride (INT) to INT-formazan. Respiring bacteria deposit accumulated INT-formazan intracellularly as dark red spots. Corresponding to electron transport system activity, these deposits attain a size and a degree of optical density which allows them to be examined by light microscopy. If polycarbonate filters and epifluorescence microscopy are applied to analyze an INT-treated water sample, it is possible to differentiate between respiring and apparently nonrespiring bacteria. This differentiation, which permits determinations of the total number of bacteria and the proportion thereof involved in respiration, is realized directly within one and the same microscopic image. Initial applications of the present method for hydrobiological purposes showed that the proportion of respiring aquatic bacteria ranged between 6 to 12% (samples taken from coastal areas of the Baltic Sea) and 5 to 36% (samples taken from freshwater lakes and ponds). Cells of 1.6 to 2.4 micrometer (freshwater) and 0.4 micrometer (Baltic Sea) account for the highest proportion of respiring bacteria.	0
Title: New WS9326A Derivatives and One New Annimycin Derivative with Antimalarial Activity are Produced by Streptomyces asterosporus DSM 41452 and Its Mutant Abstract: In this study, we report that Streptomyces asterosporus DSM 41452 is a producer of new molecules related to the nonribosomal cyclodepsipeptide WS9326A and the polyketide annimycin. S. asterosporus DSM 41452 is shown to produce six cyclodepsipeptides and peptides, WS9326A to G. Notably, the compounds WS9326F and WS9326G have not been described before. The genome of S. asterosporus DSM 41452 was sequenced, and a putative WS9326A gene cluster was identified. Gene-deletion experiments confirmed that this cluster was responsible for the biosynthesis of WS9326A to G. Additionally, a gene-deletion experiment demonstrated that sas16 encoding a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase was involved in the synthesis of the novel (E)-2,3-dehydrotyrosine residue found in WS9326A and its derivatives. An insertion mutation within the putative annimycin gene cluster led to the production of a new annimycin derivative, annimycin B, which exhibited modest inhibitory activity against Plasmodium falciparum.	0
Title: Interspecies recombination, and phylogenetic distortions, within the glutamine synthetase and shikimate dehydrogenase genes of Neisseria meningitidis and commensal Neisseria species Abstract: Visual inspection showed clear evidence of a history of intraspecies recombinational exchanges within the neighbouring meningococcal shikimate dehydrogenase (aroE) and glutamine synthetase (glnA) genes, which was supported by the non-congruence of the trees constructed from the sequences of these genes from different meningococcal strains, and by statistical tests for mosaic structure. Many examples were also found of highly localized interspecies recombinational exchanges between the meningococcal aroE and glnA genes and those of commensal Neisseria species. These exchanges appear to have inflated the sequence variation at these loci, and have resulted in major distortions of the phylogenetic trees constructed from the sequences of the aroE and glnA genes of human pathogenic and commensal Neisseria species. Statistical tests for sequence mosaicism, and for anomalies within the Neisseria species trees, strongly supported the view that frequent interspecies recombination has occurred within aroE and glnA. The high levels of sequence variation, and intra- and interspecies recombination, within aroE and glnA did not appear to be due to a 'hitch-hiking' effect caused by positive selection for variation at a neighbouring gene. Our results suggest that interspecies recombinational exchanges with commensal Neisseria occur frequently in some meningococcal 'housekeeping' genes as they can be observed readily even when there appears to be no obvious selection for the recombinant phenotypes.	0
Title: Analysis of protease-sensitive regions in the skeletal muscle sodium channel in vitro and implications for channel tertiary structure Abstract: The tertiary structure of the rat skeletal muscle sodium channel was probed in vitro by determining regions of sensitivity to V-8 protease, trypsin, and chymotrypsin. Resultant channel fragments were identified with antibodies to defined sequences distributed along the primary structure. The temporal pattern of proteolysis was followed with channel protein in either detergent-phospholipid micelles or membrane fragments as well as with channel exposed to sodium dodecyl sulfate. Proteolysis in micelles and membranes occurred in discrete, reproducible steps that were similar in both systems. Although the size of intermediates varied slightly, their sequence of appearance was similar for all enzymes, suggesting that the observed pattern was determined by the relative accessibility of selected sites in the tertiary structure. No major change in channel organization appeared to occur after solubilization of membranes in nonionic detergents. Highly accessible sites in the native structure included the carboxyl terminus and the region linking the second and third internal repeat domains, while the amino terminus and the repeat domains themselves were relatively resistant to proteolysis unless the protein was denatured. Kinetically, interdomain II-III was the most readily cleaved; interdomains I-II and especially III-IV were less easily accessible. While domains I and IV appeared to remain intact throughout our experiments, limit fragments for epitopes associated with domains II and III suggest that cleavage eventually occurs at sites between the putative S5 and S6 helices in these domains.	0
Title: Lasso Peptide Benenodin-1 Is a Thermally Actuated [1]Rotaxane Switch Abstract: Mechanically interlocked molecules that change their conformation in response to stimuli have been developed by synthetic chemists as building blocks for molecular machines. Here we describe a natural product, the lasso peptide benenodin-1, which exhibits conformational switching between two distinct threaded conformers upon actuation by heat. We have determined the structures of both conformers and have characterized the kinetics and energetics of the conformational switch. Single amino acid substitutions to benenodin-1 generate peptides that are biased to a single conformer, showing that the switching behavior is potentially an evolvable trait in these peptides. Lasso peptides such as benenodin-1 can be recognized and cleaved by enzymes called lasso peptide isopeptidases. We show that only the native conformer of benenodin-1 is cleaved by its cognate isopeptidase. Thus, thermally induced conformational switching of benenodin-1 may also be relevant to the biological function of these molecules.	0
Title: Microplastics provide new microbial niches in aquatic environments Abstract: Microplastics in the biosphere are currently of great environmental concern because of their potential toxicity for aquatic biota and human health and association with pathogenic microbiota. Microplastics can occur in high abundance in all aquatic environments, including oceans, rivers and lakes. Recent findings have highlighted the role of microplastics as important vectors for microorganisms, which can form fully developed biofilms on this artificial substrate. Microplastics therefore provide new microbial niches in the aquatic environment, and the developing biofilms may significantly differ in microbial composition compared to natural free-living or particle-associated microbial populations in the surrounding water. In this article, we discuss the composition and ecological function of the microbial communities found in microplastic biofilms. The potential factors that influence the richness and diversity of such microbial microplastic communities are also evaluated. Microbe-microbe and microbe-substrate interactions in microplastic biofilms have been little studied and are not well understood. Multiomics tools together with morphological, physiological and biochemical analyses should be combined to provide a more comprehensive overview on the ecological role of microplastic biofilms. These new microbial niches have so far unknown consequences for microbial ecology and environmental processes in aquatic ecosystems. More knowledge is required on the microbial community composition of microplastic biofilms and their ecological functions in order to better evaluate consequences for the environment and animal health, including humans, especially since the worldwide abundance of microplastics is predicted to dramatically increase. Key Points • Bacteria are mainly studied in community analyses: fungi are neglected. • Microbial colonization of microplastics depends on substrate, location and time. • Community ecology is a promising approach to investigate microbial colonization. • Biodegradable plastics, and ecological roles of microplastic biofilms, need analysis.	0
Title: Antagonizing the Androgen Receptor with a Biomimetic Acyltransferase Abstract: The Androgen Receptor (AR) remains the leading target of advanced prostate cancer therapies. Thiosalicylamide analogs have previously been shown to act in cells as acyltransfer catalysts that are capable of transferring cellular acetate, presumably from acetyl-CoA, to HIV NCp7. Here we explore if the cellular acetyl-transfer activity of thiosalicylamides can be redirected to other cellular targets guided by ligands for AR. We constructed conjugates of thiosalicylamides and the AR-binding small molecule tolfenamic acid, which binds the BF-3 site of AR, proximal to the coactivator "FXXLF" binding surface. The thiosalicylamide-tolfenamic acid conjugate, YZ03, but not the separate thiosalicylamide plus tolfenamic acid, significantly enhanced acetylation of endogenous AR in CWR22Rv1 cells. Further analysis confirms that Lys720, a residue critical to FXXLF coactivator peptide binding, is a site of acyl-YZ03 acetylation. Under acyl-transfer conditions, YZ03 significantly enhances the ability of BF-3 site binding ligands to inhibit AR-coactivator peptide association. These data suggest that biomimetic acyltransferases can enhance protein-protein interaction inhibitors through covalent modification of critical interfacial residues.	0
Title: Bioenergetic consequences of cardiac phosphocreatine depletion induced by creatine analogue feeding Abstract: To further evaluate the bioenergetic role of phosphocreatine, we assessed several parameters in normal and depleted rat hearts. Rats were fed (8 weeks) a diet containing either 1% beta-guanidinoproprionic acid or 2% beta-guanidinobutyric acid (beta-GBA), resulting in an 80% phosphocreatine depletion compared to controls. Left ventricular pressure-volume curves were obtained to determine contractile function. At any volume, the developed pressure in depleted hearts was lower than in controls. At the plateau, the rate-pressure product was between 37-45% lower: 34,000 (beta-GBA), 30,174 (beta-guanidinoproprionic acid) versus 54,400 (control). 31P NMR spectroscopy on beta-GBA-treated hearts obtained the [ATP] and [phosphocreatine], which with saturation transfer estimated the rates of creatine kinase and ATP production. In depleted hearts, the rate constant for ATP synthesis from phosphocreatine was increased 33%. However, the flux was 72% lower. ATP production from ADP and Pi were similar under normal conditions, in spite of higher rates of oxygen consumption in the depleted hearts. The addition of 50 mM creatine to control perfusate had no effect on function or high energy phosphates. In contrast, a 28% increase in function and a 52% increase in [phosphocreatine] was seen in beta-GBA hearts. There was a marked increase in free [ADP] in beta-GBA hearts, resulting in a lower estimated ATP phosphorylation potential. Overall, the results suggest that phosphocreatine may play an important function by optimizing the thermodynamics of cardiac high energy phosphate utilization.	0
Title: Otoancorin, an inner ear protein restricted to the interface between the apical surface of sensory epithelia and their overlying acellular gels, is defective in autosomal recessive deafness DFNB22 Abstract: A 3,673-bp murine cDNA predicted to encode a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored protein of 1,088 amino acids was isolated during a study aimed at identifying transcripts specifically expressed in the inner ear. This inner ear-specific protein, otoancorin, shares weak homology with megakaryocyte potentiating factor/mesothelin precursor. Otoancorin is located at the interface between the apical surface of the inner ear sensory epithelia and their overlying acellular gels. In the cochlea, otoancorin is detected at two attachment zones of the tectorial membrane, a permanent one along the top of the spiral limbus and a transient one on the surface of the developing greater epithelial ridge. In the vestibule, otoancorin is present on the apical surface of nonsensory cells, where they contact the otoconial membranes and cupulae. The identification of the mutation (IVS12+2T>C) in the corresponding gene OTOA in one consanguineous Palestinian family affected by nonsyndromic recessive deafness DFNB22 assigns an essential function to otoancorin. We propose that otoancorin ensures the attachment of the inner ear acellular gels to the apical surface of the underlying nonsensory cells.	0
Title: Genomic and transcriptomic comparison of Aspergillus oryzae strains: a case study in soy sauce koji fermentation Abstract: The filamentous fungus Aspergillus oryzae is used in soy sauce koji making due to its high productivity of hydrolytic enzymes. In this study, we compared the genomes and transcriptomes of an industrial strain RD2 and a strain with decreased fermentation performance TS2, aiming to explain their phenotypic differences at the molecular level. Under the regulation of conidiation and fermentation conditions, the enhanced hydrolytic enzyme production and flavor precursor formation in RD2 described a complete expression profile necessary to maintain desirable fermentation performance. By contrast, central carbon metabolism was up-regulated in TS2 for fast growth, suggesting a conflicting relationship between mycelium growth and fermentation performance. Accumulation of mutations also lowered the fermentation performance of TS2. Our study has deepened the understanding of the metabolism and related regulatory mechanisms in desirable koji fermentation. A list of potential molecular markers identified here could facilitate targeted strain maintenance and improvement for better koji fermentation.	0
Title: Discovery of McbB, an enzyme catalyzing the β-carboline skeleton construction in the marinacarboline biosynthetic pathway Abstract: Three genes, mcbABC, that drive the biosynthesis of marinacarbolines, have been elucidated through genome mining, gene inactivation, heterologous expression, feeding, and site-directed mutagenesis experiments. McbB is highlighted as a novel enzyme for the β-carboline core construction, which involves a Pictet-Spengler cyclization process and requiring E97 for biochemical activity.	1
Title: Identification and characterization of pltZ, a gene involved in the repression of pyoluteorin biosynthesis in Pseudomonas sp. M18 Abstract: A new regulator gene named pltZ, which is located downstream of the plt gene cluster in the genome of Pseudomonas sp. M18, was identified, sequenced and characterized in this report. The deduced amino acid sequence of PltZ shares significant homology with other bacterial regulators in the TetR family. The chromosomal pltZ disruption mutant gave rise to 4.4-fold enhancement of pyoluteorin biosynthesis but did not exert significant influence on the accumulation of phenazine-1-carboxylic acid compared with the wild-type M18. The negative regulation of pltZ on pyoluteorin biosynthesis was further confirmed by multiplied pltZ gene dosage experiments and pltA'-'lacZ translational fusion analyses.	1
Title: Purine and pyrimidine transport by cultured Novikoff cells. Specificities and mechanism of transport and relationship to phosphoribosylation Abstract: Adenine, guanine, and hypoxanthine were rapidly incorporated into the acid-soluble nucleotide pool and nucleic acids by wild type Novikoff cells. Incorporation followed normal Michaelis-Menten kinetics, but the following evidence indicates that specific transport processes precede the phosphoribosyltransferase reactions and are the rate-limiting step in purine incorporation by whole cells. Cells of an azaguanine-resistant subline of Novikoff cells which lacked hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase activity and failed to incorporate guanine or hypoxanthine into the nucleotide pool, exhibited uptake of guanine and hypoxanthine by a saturable process. Similarly, wild type cells which had been preincubated in a glucose-free basal medium containing KCN and iodoacetate transported guanine and hypoxanthine normally, although a conversion of these purines to nucleotides did not occur in these cells. The mutant and KCN-iodoacetate treated wild type cells also exhibited countertransport of guanine and hypoxanthine when preloaded with various purines, uracil, and pyrimidine nucleosides. The cells also possess a saturable transport system for uracil although they lack phosphoribosyltransferase activity for uracil. In the absence of phosphoribosylation, none of the substrates was accumulated against a concentration gradient. Thus transport is by facilitated diffusion (nonconcentrative transport). Furthermore, the apparent Km values for purine uptake by untreated wild type and azaguanine-resistant cells were higher and the apparent Vmax values were lower than those for the corresponding phosphoribosyltransferases...	0
Title: Modeling of the bacterial growth curve Abstract: Several sigmoidal functions (logistic, Gompertz, Richards, Schnute, and Stannard) were compared to describe a bacterial growth curve. They were compared statistically by using the model of Schnute, which is a comprehensive model, encompassing all other models. The t test and the F test were used. With the t test, confidence intervals for parameters can be calculated and can be used to distinguish between models. In the F test, the lack of fit of the models is compared with the measuring error. Moreover, the models were compared with respect to their ease of use. All sigmoidal functions were modified so that they contained biologically relevant parameters. The models of Richards, Schnute, and Stannard appeared to be basically the same equation. In the cases tested, the modified Gompertz equation was statistically sufficient to describe the growth data of Lactobacillus plantarum and was easy to use.	0
Title: Nucleotide sequence and deduced functions of a set of cotranscribed genes of Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) including the polyketide synthase for the antibiotic actinorhodin Abstract: A 5.3-kb region of the Streptomyces coelicolor actinorhodin gene cluster, including the genes for polyketide biosynthesis, was sequenced. Six identified open reading frames (ORF1-6) were related to genetically characterized mutations of classes actI, VII, IV, and VB by complementation analysis. ORF1-6 run divergently from the adjacent actIII gene, which encodes the polyketide synthase (PKS) ketoreductase, and appear to form an operon. The deduced gene products of ORF1-3 are similar to fatty acid synthases (FAS) of different organisms and PKS genes from other polyketide producers. The predicted ORF5 gene product is similar to type II beta-lactamases of Bacillus cereus and Bacteroides fragilis. The ORF6 product does not resemble other known proteins. Combining the genetical, biochemical, and similarity data, the potential activities of the products of the six genes can be postulated as: 1) condensing enzyme/acyl transferase (ORF1 + ORF2); 2) acyl carrier protein (ORF3); 3) putative cyclase/dehydrase (ORF4); 4) dehydrase (ORF5); and 5) "dimerase" (ORF6). The data show that the actinorhodin PKS consists of discrete monofunctional components, like that of the Escherichia coli (Type II) FAS, rather than the multifunctional polypeptides for the macrolide PKSs and vertebrate FASs (Type I).	1
Title: Amino-group carrier-protein-mediated secondary metabolite biosynthesis in Streptomyces Abstract: Amino-group carrier proteins (AmCPs) mediate the biosynthesis of lysine and arginine in some bacteria and archaea. Here we demonstrate that an uncharacterized AmCP-mediated biosynthetic system functions to biosynthesize the previously uncharacterized and nonproteinogenic amino acid (2S,6R)-diamino-(5R,7)-dihydroxy-heptanoic acid (DADH) in Streptomyces sp. SANK 60404. DADH is incorporated into a novel peptide metabolite, vazabitide A, featuring an azabicyclo-ring structure, by nonribosomal peptide synthetases and successive modification enzymes in this bacterium. As the AmCP-mediated machinery for DADH biosynthesis is widely distributed in bacteria, further analysis of uncharacterized AmCP-containing gene clusters will lead to the discovery of novel bioactive compounds and novel biosynthetic enzymes.	1
Title: Expression of the genes for guanyl-specific ribonucleases from Bacillus intermedius and Bacillus pumilus is regulated by the two component signal transduction system PhoP-PhoR in B. subtilis Abstract: Promoters of the genes for guanyl-specific ribonucleases, secreted by B. intermedius (binase) and B. pumilus (Rnase Bp) in phosphate deficient conditions, contain regions similar to appropriate consensus sequences in promoters of the PHO regulated genes of B. subtilis. A number of genes expressed in response to phosphate starvation in B. subtilis are regulated by the two component signal transduction system PhoP-PhoR. Expression of recombinant genes for binase and RNase Bp in B. subtilis strains with mutations in the regulatory protein genes of the PHO regulon was studied. Their expression is strongly regulated by the regulatory proteins of the B. subtilis PHO regulon.	0
Title: Identification and characterization of a welwitindolinone alkaloid biosynthetic gene cluster in the stigonematalean Cyanobacterium Hapalosiphon welwitschii Abstract: The identification of a 36 kb welwitindolinone (wel) biosynthetic gene cluster in Hapalosiphon welwitschii UTEX B1830 is reported. Characterization of the enzymes responsible for assembling the early biosynthetic intermediates geranyl pyrophosphate and 3-((Z)-2′-isocyanoethenyl)indole as well as a dedicated N-methyltransferase in the maturation of N-methylwelwitindolinone C isothiocyanate solidified the link between the wel pathway and welwitindolinone biosynthesis. Comparative analysis of the ambiguine and welwitindolinone biosynthetic pathways in two different organisms provided insights into the origins of diverse structures within hapalindole-type molecules.	1
Title: Differential Microbial Composition of Monovarietal and Blended Extra Virgin Olive Oils Determines Oil Quality During Storage Abstract: Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) contains a biotic fraction, which is characterized by various microorganisms, including yeasts. The colonization of microorganisms in the freshly produced EVOO is determined by the physicochemical characteristics of the product. The production of blended EVOO with balanced taste, which is obtained by blending several monovarietal EVOOs, modifies the original microbiota of each oil due to the differential physico-chemical characteristics of the blended oil. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of microbial composition on the stability of the quality indices of the monovarietal and blended EVOOs derived from Leccino, Peranzana, Coratina, and Ravece olive varieties after six months of storage. The yeasts survived only in the monovarietal EVOOs during six months of storage. Barnettozyma californica, Candida adriatica, Candida diddensiae, and Yamadazyma terventina were the predominant yeast species, whose abundance varied in the four monovarietal EVOOs. However, the number of yeasts markedly decreased during the first three months of storage in all blended EVOOs. Thus, all blended EVOOs were more stable than the monovarietal EVOOs as the abundance and activity of microorganisms were limited during storage.	0
Title: Imaging mass spectrometry and genome mining via short sequence tagging identified the anti-infective agent arylomycin in Streptomyces roseosporus Abstract: Here, we described the discovery of anti-infective agent arylomycin and its biosynthetic gene cluster in an industrial daptomycin producing strain Streptomyces roseosporus. This was accomplished via the use of MALDI imaging mass spectrometry (IMS) along with peptidogenomic approach in which we have expanded to short sequence tagging (SST) described herein. Using IMS, we observed that prior to the production of daptomycin, a cluster of ions (1-3) was produced by S. roseosporus and correlated well with the decreased staphylococcal cell growth. With a further adopted SST peptidogenomics approach, which relies on the generation of sequence tags from tandem mass spectrometric data and query against genomes to identify the biosynthetic genes, we were able to identify these three molecules (1-3) to arylomycins, a class of broad-spectrum antibiotics that target type I signal peptidase. The gene cluster was then identified. This highlights the strength of IMS and MS guided genome mining approaches in effectively bridging the gap between phenotypes, chemotypes, and genotypes.	1
Title: Electron paramagnetic resonance evidence that cellular oxygen toxicity is caused by the generation of superoxide and hydroxyl free radicals Abstract: Cells require molecular oxygen for the generation of energy through mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation; however, high concentrations of oxygen are toxic and can cause cell death. A number of different mechanisms have been proposed to cause cellular oxygen toxicity. One hypothesis is that reactive oxygen free radicals may be generated; however free radical generation in hyperoxic cells has never been directly measured and the mechanism of this radical generation is unknown. In order to determine if cellular oxygen toxicity is free radical mediated, we applied electron paramagnetic resonance, EPR, spectroscopy using the spin trap 5,5'-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide, DMPO, to measure free radical generation in hyperoxic pulmonary endothelial cells. Cells in air did not give rise to any detectable signal. However, cells exposed to 100% O2 for 30 min exhibited a prominent signal of trapped hydroxyl radical, DMPO-OH, while cell free buffer did not give rise to any detectable radical generation. This cellular radical generation was demonstrated to be derived from the superoxide radical since the observed signal was totally quenched by superoxide dismutase, but not by equal concentrations of the denatured enzyme. It was confirmed that the hydroxyl radical was generated since in the presence of ethanol the CH3 CH(OH) radical was formed. Loss of cell viability as measured by uptake of trypan blue dye was observed paralleling the measured free radical generation. Thus, superoxide and hydroxyl radicals are generated in hyperoxic pulmonary endothelial cells and this appears to be an important mechanism of cellular oxygen toxicity.	0
Title: Biosynthesis of antinutritional alkaloids in solanaceous crops is mediated by clustered genes Abstract: Steroidal glycoalkaloids (SGAs) such as α-solanine found in solanaceous food plants--as, for example, potato--are antinutritional factors for humans. Comparative coexpression analysis between tomato and potato coupled with chemical profiling revealed an array of 10 genes that partake in SGA biosynthesis. We discovered that six of them exist as a cluster on chromosome 7, whereas an additional two are adjacent in a duplicated genomic region on chromosome 12. Following systematic functional analysis, we suggest a revised SGA biosynthetic pathway starting from cholesterol up to the tetrasaccharide moiety linked to the tomato SGA aglycone. Silencing GLYCOALKALOID METABOLISM 4 prevented accumulation of SGAs in potato tubers and tomato fruit. This may provide a means for removal of unsafe, antinutritional substances present in these widely used food crops.	1
Title: Mini-review: Brazilian fungi diversity for biomass degradation Abstract: Brazil houses over 10% of the total number of known species on Earth, with a great diversity of plants and fungi. The collection, isolation, identification and conservation of filamentous fungi with relevance to agriculture, pharmaceutical, food and biotechnological industries in Biological Resource Centers (CRBs) is very important to the development of a nation's scientific and technological infrastructure. In Brazil, 36 fungal collections are registered in the database of International Collections. Several federal and state programs have encouraged the formation of a researcher's network in order to study natural resources and the nation's biodiversity. In this context, Brazilian researchers have been on the frontiers of knowledge, investigating the enzymatic systems from native filamentous fungi with potential for biomass degradation and biotechnological application. In this review, we address recent progress in Brazilian fungal research, focusing on the identification and study of fungi and enzymes with potential for biomass degradation and application in bioenergy.	0
Title: Mixing and matching siderophore clusters: structure and biosynthesis of serratiochelins from Serratia sp. V4 Abstract: Interrogation of the evolutionary history underlying the remarkable structures and biological activities of natural products has been complicated by not knowing the functions they have evolved to fulfill. Siderophores-soluble, low molecular weight compounds-have an easily understood and measured function: acquiring iron from the environment. Bacteria engage in a fierce competition to acquire iron, which rewards the production of siderophores that bind iron tightly and cannot be used or pirated by competitors. The structures and biosyntheses of "odd" siderophores can reveal the evolutionary strategy that led to their creation. We report a new Serratia strain that produces serratiochelin and an analog of serratiochelin. A genetic approach located the serratiochelin gene cluster, and targeted mutations in several genes implicated in serratiochelin biosynthesis were generated. Bioinformatic analyses and mutagenesis results demonstrate that genes from two well-known siderophore clusters, the Escherichia coli enterobactin cluster and the Vibrio cholera vibriobactin cluster, were shuffled to produce a new siderophore biosynthetic pathway. These results highlight how modular siderophore gene clusters can be mixed and matched during evolution to generate structural diversity in siderophores.	1
Title: Nucleotide sequence of the leader region of the phenylalanine operon of Escherichia coli Abstract: The pheA structural gene of the phenylalanine operon of Escherichia coli is preceded by a transcribed leader region of about 170 nucleotide pairs. In vitro transcription of plasmids and restriction fragments containing the phe promoter and leader region yields a major RNA transcript about 140 nucleotides in length. This transcript, pheA leader RNA, has the following features: (i) a potential ribosome binding site and AUG translation start codon about 20 nucleotides from its 5' end; (ii) 14 additional in phase amino acid codons and a UGA stop codon after the AUG; 7 of these 14 are Phe codons; (iii) a 3'-OH terminus about 140 nucleotides from the 5' end (transcription termination occurs in an A.T-rich region which is subsequent to a G.C-rich region; just beyond the site of transcription termination there is a sequence corresponding to a ribosome binding site and the AUG translation start codon of the pheA structural gene); (iv) a sequence which would permit extensive intrastrand stable hydrogen bonding. In addition to G.C-rich stem structures, highly analogous to those proposed for the leader RNAs of the tryptophan operons of E. coli and Salmonella typhimurium [Lee, F. & Yanofsky, C. (1977) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 74, 4365-4369], there is also extensive base-pairing possible between the phe codon region and a more distal region of the leader transcript. The roles of synthesis of the Phe-rich leader peptide and secondary structure of the leader transcript in the regulation of transcription termination at the attenuator of the phe operon are discussed.	0
Title: Identification of a 14-3-3 protein from Lentinus edodes that interacts with CAP (adenylyl cyclase-associated protein), and conservation of this interaction in fission yeast Abstract: We previously identified a gene encoding a CAP (adenylyl cyclase-associated protein) homologue from the edible Basidiomycete Lentinus edodes. To further discover the cellular functions of the CAP protein, we searched for CAP-interacting proteins using a yeast two-hybrid system. Among the candidates thus obtained, many clones encoded the C-terminal half of an L. edodes 14-3-3 homologue (designated cip3). Southern blot analysis indicated that L. edodes contains only one 14-3-3 gene. Overexpression of the L. edodes 14-3-3 protein in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe rad24 null cells complemented the loss of endogenous 14-3-3 protein functions in cell morphology and UV sensitivity, suggesting functional conservation of 14-3-3 proteins between L. edodes and S. pombe. The interaction between L. edodes CAP and 14-3-3 protein was restricted to the N-terminal domain of CAP and was confirmed by in vitro co-precipitation. Results from both the two-hybrid system and in vivo co-precipitation experiments showed the conservation of this interaction in S. pombe. The observation that a 14-3-3 protein interacts with the N-terminal portion of CAP but not with full-length CAP in L. edodes and S. pombe suggests that the C-terminal region of CAP may have a negative effect on the interaction between CAP and 14-3-3 proteins, and 14-3-3 proteins may play a role in regulation of CAP function.	0
Title: Leader peptide and a membrane protein scaffold guide the biosynthesis of the tricyclic peptide microviridin Abstract: Microviridins are unique protease inhibitors from bloom-forming cyanobacteria that have both ecological and pharmacological relevance. Their peptide backbones are produced ribosomally, and ATP grasp ligases introduce ω-ester and ω-amide bonds to yield rare cage-like structures. Bioinformatic analysis of the microviridin biosynthesis gene cluster suggests a novel type of processing machinery, which could rationalize the challenging in vivo/in vitro reconstitution of the pathway. In this work, we report the establishment of a minimal expression system for microviridins. Through bioinformatics and mutational analysis of the MdnA leader peptide we identified and characterized a strictly conserved binding motif that is specific for microviridin ligases. Furthermore, we showed that the ABC transporter MdnE is crucial for cyclization and processing of microviridins and demonstrated that MdnE is essential for stability of the microviridin biosynthesis complex.	1
Title: Identification of a Polyketide Synthase Involved in Sorbicillin Biosynthesis by Penicillium chrysogenum Abstract: Secondary metabolism in Penicillium chrysogenum was intensively subjected to classical strain improvement (CSI), the resulting industrial strains producing high levels of β-lactams. During this process, the production of yellow pigments, including sorbicillinoids, was eliminated as part of a strategy to enable the rapid purification of β-lactams. Here we report the identification of the polyketide synthase (PKS) gene essential for sorbicillinoid biosynthesis in P. chrysogenum We demonstrate that the production of polyketide precursors like sorbicillinol and dihydrosorbicillinol as well as their derivatives bisorbicillinoids requires the function of a highly reducing PKS encoded by the gene Pc21g05080 (pks13). This gene belongs to the cluster that was mutated and transcriptionally silenced during the strain improvement program. Using an improved β-lactam-producing strain, repair of the mutation in pks13 led to the restoration of sorbicillinoid production. This now enables genetic studies on the mechanism of sorbicillinoid biosynthesis in P. chrysogenum and opens new perspectives for pathway engineering.                  Importance:                       Sorbicillinoids are secondary metabolites with antiviral, anti-inflammatory, and antimicrobial activities produced by filamentous fungi. This study identified the gene cluster responsible for sorbicillinoid formation in Penicillium chrysogenum, which now allows engineering of this diverse group of compounds.	1
Title: Gold(I)-Catalyzed Enantioselective Desymmetrization of 1,3-Diols through Intramolecular Hydroalkoxylation of Allenes Abstract: A gold(I)-catalyzed enantioselective desymmetrization of 1,3-diols was achieved by intramolecular hydroalkoxylation of allenes. The catalyst system 3-F-dppe(AuCl)2/(R)-C8-TRIPAg proved to be specifically efficient to promote the desymmetrizing cyclization of 2-aryl-1,3-diols, which have proven challenging substrates in previous reports. Multisubstituted tetrahydrofurans were prepared in good yield with good enantioselectivity and diastereoselectivity by this method.	0
Title: Identification of late-stage glycosylation steps in the biosynthetic pathway of the anthracycline nogalamycin Abstract: Nogalamycin is an anthracycline antibiotic that has been shown to exhibit significant cytotoxicity. Its biological activity requires two deoxysugar moieties: nogalose and nogalamine, which are attached at C7 and C1, respectively, of the aromatic polyketide aglycone. Curiously, the aminosugar nogalamine is also connected through a C-C bond between C2 and C5''. Despite extensive molecular genetic characterization of early biosynthetic steps, nogalamycin glycosylation has not been investigated in detail. Here we show that expression of the majority of the gene cluster in Streptomyces albus led to accumulation of three new anthracyclines, which unexpectedly included nogalamycin derivatives in which nogalamine was replaced either by rhodosamine with the C-C bond intact (nogalamycin R) or by 2-deoxyfucose without the C-C bond (nogalamycin F). In addition, a monoglycosylated intermediate-3',4'-demethoxynogalose-1-hydroxynogalamycinone-was isolated. Importantly, when the remaining biosynthetic genes were introduced into the heterologous host by using a two-plasmid system, nogalamycin could be isolated from the cultures, thus indicating that the whole gene cluster had been identified. We further show that one of the three glycosyltransferases (GTs) residing in the cluster-snogZ-appears to be redundant, whereas gene inactivation experiments revealed that snogE and snogD act as nogalose and nogalamine transferases, respectively. The substrate specificity of the nogalamine transferase SnogD was demonstrated in vitro: the enzyme was able to remove 2deoxyfucose from nogalamycin F. All of the new compounds were found to inhibit human topoisomerase I in activity measurements, whereas only nogalamycin R showed minor activity against topoisomerase II.	1
Title: In Situ Activation and Heterologous Production of a Cryptic Lantibiotic from an African Plant Ant-Derived Saccharopolyspora Species Abstract: Most clinical antibiotics are derived from actinomycete natural products discovered at least 60 years ago. However, the repeated rediscovery of known compounds led the pharmaceutical industry to largely discard microbial natural products (NPs) as a source of new chemical diversity. Recent advances in genome sequencing have revealed that these organisms have the potential to make many more NPs than previously thought. Approaches to unlock NP biosynthesis by genetic manipulation of strains, by the application of chemical genetics, or by microbial cocultivation have resulted in the identification of new antibacterial compounds. Concomitantly, intensive exploration of coevolved ecological niches, such as insect-microbe defensive symbioses, has revealed these to be a rich source of chemical novelty. Here, we report the new lanthipeptide antibiotic kyamicin, which was generated through the activation of a cryptic biosynthetic gene cluster identified by genome mining Saccharopolyspora species found in the obligate domatium-dwelling ant Tetraponera penzigi of the ant plant Vachellia drepanolobium Transcriptional activation of this silent gene cluster was achieved by ectopic expression of a pathway-specific activator under the control of a constitutive promoter. Subsequently, a heterologous production platform was developed which enabled the purification of kyamicin for structural characterization and bioactivity determination. This strategy was also successful for the production of lantibiotics from other genera, paving the way for a synthetic heterologous expression platform for the discovery of lanthipeptides that are not detected under laboratory conditions or that are new to nature.IMPORTANCE The discovery of novel antibiotics to tackle the growing threat of antimicrobial resistance is impeded by difficulties in accessing the full biosynthetic potential of microorganisms. The development of new tools to unlock the biosynthesis of cryptic bacterial natural products will greatly increase the repertoire of natural product scaffolds. Here, we report a strategy for the ectopic expression of pathway-specific positive regulators that can be rapidly applied to activate the biosynthesis of cryptic lanthipeptide biosynthetic gene clusters. This allowed the discovery of a new lanthipeptide antibiotic directly from the native host and via heterologous expression.	1
Title: Ethambutol Partitioning in Tuberculous Pulmonary Lesions Explains Its Clinical Efficacy Abstract: Clinical trials and practice have shown that ethambutol is an important component of the first-line tuberculosis (TB) regime. This contrasts the drug's rather modest potency and lack of activity against nongrowing persister mycobacteria. The standard plasma-based pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic profile of ethambutol suggests that the drug may be of limited clinical value. Here, we hypothesized that this apparent contradiction may be explained by favorable penetration of the drug into TB lesions. First, we utilized novel in vitro lesion pharmacokinetic assays and predicted good penetration of the drug into lesions. We then employed mass spectrometry imaging and laser capture microdissection coupled to liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry (LCM and LC/MS-MS, respectively) to show that ethambutol, indeed, accumulates in diseased tissues and penetrates the major human-like lesion types represented in the rabbit model of TB disease with a lesion-to-plasma exposure ratio ranging from 9 to 12. In addition, ethambutol exhibits slow but sustained passive diffusion into caseum to reach concentrations markedly higher than those measured in plasma at steady state. The results explain why ethambutol has retained its place in the first-line regimen, validate our in vitro lesion penetration assays, and demonstrate the critical importance of effective lesion penetration for anti-TB drugs. Our findings suggest that in vitro and in vivo lesion penetration evaluation should be included in TB drug discovery programs. Finally, this is the first time that LCM with LC-MS/MS has been used to quantify a small molecule at high spatial resolution in infected tissues, a method that can easily be extended to other infectious diseases.	0
Title: Eliciting the silent lucensomycin biosynthetic pathway in Streptomyces cyanogenus S136 via manipulation of the global regulatory gene adpA Abstract: Actinobacteria are among the most prolific sources of medically and agriculturally important compounds, derived from their biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) for specialized (secondary) pathways of metabolism. Genomics witnesses that the majority of actinobacterial BGCs are silent, most likely due to their low or zero transcription. Much effort is put into the search for approaches towards activation of silent BGCs, as this is believed to revitalize the discovery of novel natural products. We hypothesized that the global transcriptional factor AdpA, due to its highly degenerate operator sequence, could be used to upregulate the expression of silent BGCs. Using Streptomyces cyanogenus S136 as a test case, we showed that plasmids expressing either full-length adpA or its DNA-binding domain led to significant changes in the metabolome. These were evident as changes in the accumulation of colored compounds, bioactivity, as well as the emergence of a new pattern of secondary metabolites as revealed by HPLC-ESI-mass spectrometry. We further focused on the most abundant secondary metabolite and identified it as the polyene antibiotic lucensomycin. Finally, we uncovered the entire gene cluster for lucensomycin biosynthesis (lcm), that remained elusive for five decades until now, and outlined an evidence-based scenario for its adpA-mediated activation.	1
Title: Iterative Mechanism of Macrodiolide Formation in the Anticancer Compound Conglobatin Abstract: Conglobatin is an unusual C2-symmetrical macrodiolide from the bacterium Streptomyces conglobatus with promising antitumor activity. Insights into the genes and enzymes that govern both the assembly-line production of the conglobatin polyketide and its dimerization are essential to allow rational alterations to be made to the conglobatin structure. We have used a rapid, direct in vitro cloning method to obtain the entire cluster on a 41-kbp fragment, encoding a modular polyketide synthase assembly line. The cloned cluster directs conglobatin biosynthesis in a heterologous host strain. Using a model substrate to mimic the conglobatin monomer, we also show that the conglobatin cyclase/thioesterase acts iteratively, ligating two monomers head-to-tail then re-binding the dimer product and cyclizing it. Incubation of two different monomers with the cyclase produces hybrid dimers and trimers, providing the first evidence that conglobatin analogs may in future become accessible through engineering of the polyketide synthase.	1
Title: Characterization of the lacticin 481 operon: the Lactococcus lactis genes lctF, lctE, and lctG encode a putative ABC transporter involved in bacteriocin immunity Abstract: The lantibiotic lacticin 481 is a bacteriocin produced by Lactococcus lactis strains. The genetic determinants of lacticin 481 production are organized as an operon encoded by a 70-kb plasmid. We previously reported the first three genes of this operon, lctA, lctM, and lctT, which are involved in the bacteriocin biosynthesis and export (A. Rincé, A. Dufour, S. Le Pogam, D. Thuault, C. M. Bourgeois, and J.-P. Le Pennec, Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 60:1652-1657, 1994). The operon contains three additional open reading frames: lctF, lctE, and lctG. The hydrophobicity profiles and sequence similarities strongly suggest that the three gene products associate to form an ABC transporter. When the three genes were coexpressed into a lacticin 481-sensitive L. lactis strain, the strain became resistant to the bacteriocin. This protection could not be obtained when any of the three genes was deleted, confirming that lctF, lctE, and lctG are all necessary to provide immunity to lacticin 481. The quantification of the levels of immunity showed that lctF, lctE, and lctG could account for at least 6% and up to 100% of the immunity of the wild-type lacticin 481 producer strain, depending on the gene expression regulation. The lacticin 481 biosynthesis and immunity systems are discussed and compared to other lantibiotic systems.	1
Title: Laser printing of silicon nanoparticles with resonant optical electric and magnetic responses Abstract: Silicon nanoparticles with sizes of a few hundred nanometres exhibit unique optical properties due to their strong electric and magnetic dipole responses in the visible range. Here we demonstrate a novel laser printing technique for the controlled fabrication and precise deposition of silicon nanoparticles. Using femtosecond laser pulses it is possible to vary the size of Si nanoparticles and their crystallographic phase. Si nanoparticles produced by femtosecond laser printing are initially in an amorphous phase (a-Si). They can be converted into the crystalline phase (c-Si) by irradiating them with a second femtosecond laser pulse. The resonance-scattering spectrum of c-Si nanoparticles, compared with that of a-Si nanoparticles, is blue shifted and its peak intensity is about three times higher. Resonant optical responses of dielectric nanoparticles are characterized by accumulation of electromagnetic energy in the excited modes, which can be used for the realization of nanoantennas, nanolasers and metamaterials.	0
Title: Functional effects of increased copy number of the gene encoding proclavaminate amidino hydrolase on clavulanic acid production in Streptomyces clavuligerus ATCC 27064 Abstract: The effect of increasing levels of proclavaminate amidino hydrolase (Pah) on the rate of clavulanic acid production in Streptomyces clavuligerus ATCC 27064 was evaluated by knock-in a gene (pah2) encoding Pah. A strain (SMF5703) harboring a multicopy plasmid containing the pah2 gene showed significantly retarded cell growth and reduced clavulanic acid production, possibly attributable to the deleterious effects of the multicopy plasmid. In contrast, a strain (SMF5704) carrying a single additional copy of pah2 introduced into chromosome via an integrative plasmid showed enhanced production of clavulanic acid and increased levels of pah2 transcripts. Analysis of transcripts of other genes involved in the clavulanic acid biosynthetic pathway revealed a pattern similar to that seen in the parent. From these results, it appears that clavulanic acid production can be enhanced by duplication of pah2 through integration of a second copy of the gene into chromosome. However, increasing the copy number of only one gene, such as pah2, does not affect the expression of other pathway genes, and so only modest improvements in clavulanic acid production can be expected. Flux controlled by Pah did increase when the copy number of pah2 was doubled, suggesting that under these growth conditions, Pah levels may be a limiting factor regulating the rate of clavulanic acid biosynthesis in S. clavuligerus.	1
Title: Expanding our understanding of sequence-function relationships of type II polyketide biosynthetic gene clusters: bioinformatics-guided identification of Frankiamicin A from Frankia sp. EAN1pec Abstract: A large and rapidly increasing number of unstudied "orphan" natural product biosynthetic gene clusters are being uncovered in sequenced microbial genomes. An important goal of modern natural products research is to be able to accurately predict natural product structures and biosynthetic pathways from these gene cluster sequences. This requires both development of bioinformatic methods for global analysis of these gene clusters and experimental characterization of select products produced by gene clusters with divergent sequence characteristics. Here, we conduct global bioinformatic analysis of all available type II polyketide gene cluster sequences and identify a conserved set of gene clusters with unique ketosynthase α/β sequence characteristics in the genomes of Frankia species, a group of Actinobacteria with underexploited natural product biosynthetic potential. Through LC-MS profiling of extracts from several Frankia species grown under various conditions, we identified Frankia sp. EAN1pec as producing a compound with spectral characteristics consistent with the type II polyketide produced by this gene cluster. We isolated the compound, a pentangular polyketide which we named frankiamicin A, and elucidated its structure by NMR and labeled precursor feeding. We also propose biosynthetic and regulatory pathways for frankiamicin A based on comparative genomic analysis and literature precedent, and conduct bioactivity assays of the compound. Our findings provide new information linking this set of Frankia gene clusters with the compound they produce, and our approach has implications for accurate functional prediction of the many other type II polyketide clusters present in bacterial genomes.	1
Title: Structures of OA-6129D and E, new carbapenam antibiotics Abstract: The structures and stereochemistry of OA- 6129D and E, new carbapenam compounds produced by Streptomyces sp. OA-6129, were determined by spectroscopic analysis and chemical transformation.	0
Title: Facile synthesis of the trans-fused azabicyclo[3.3.0]octane core of the palau'amines and the tricyclic core of the axinellamines from a common intermediate Abstract: A facile synthesis of the trans-fused azabicyclo[3.3.0]octane core of palau'amine and related pyrrole-imidazole alkaloids is described. Following gamma-lactam cleavage with concomitant epimerization at C12 of a previously reported tricycle, a facile intramolecular Mitsunobu reaction delivered the fully functionalized tricyclic core common to several members of the oroidin-derived alkaloids including palau'amine. An alternative cyclization of a related intermediate provides the tricyclic "aza-angular triquinane" core of the axinellamines.	0
Title: Biotransformation of 2-benzoxazolinone and 2-hydroxy-1,4-benzoxazin-3-one by endophytic fungi isolated from Aphelandra tetragona Abstract: The biotransformation of the phytoanticipins 2-benzoxazolinone (BOA) and 2-hydroxy-1,4-benzoxazin-3-one (HBOA) by four endophytic fungi isolated from Aphelandra tetragona was studied. Using high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, several new products of acylation, oxidation, reduction, hydrolysis, and nitration were identified. Fusarium sambucinum detoxified BOA and HBOA to N-(2-hydroxyphenyl)malonamic acid. Plectosporium tabacinum, Gliocladium cibotii, and Chaetosphaeria sp. transformed HBOA to 2-hydroxy-N-(2-hydroxyphenyl)acetamide, N-(2-hydroxyphenyl)acetamide, N-(2-hydroxy-5-nitrophenyl)acetamide, N-(2-hydroxy-3-nitrophenyl)acetamide, 2-amino-3H-phenoxazin-3-one, 2-acetylamino-3H-phenoxazin-3-one, and 2-(N-hydroxy)acetylamino-3H-phenoxazin-3-one. BOA was not degraded by these three fungal isolates. Using 2-hydroxy-N-(2-hydroxyphenyl)[(13)C(2)]acetamide, it was shown that the metabolic pathway for HBOA and BOA degradation leads to o-aminophenol as a key intermediate.	0
Title: Structure of full-length Drosophila cryptochrome Abstract: The cryptochrome/photolyase (CRY/PL) family of photoreceptors mediates adaptive responses to ultraviolet and blue light exposure in all kingdoms of life. Whereas PLs function predominantly in DNA repair of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) and 6-4 photolesions caused by ultraviolet radiation, CRYs transduce signals important for growth, development, magnetosensitivity and circadian clocks. Despite these diverse functions, PLs/CRYs preserve a common structural fold, a dependence on flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) and an internal photoactivation mechanism. However, members of the CRY/PL family differ in the substrates recognized (protein or DNA), photochemical reactions catalysed and involvement of an antenna cofactor. It is largely unknown how the animal CRYs that regulate circadian rhythms act on their substrates. CRYs contain a variable carboxy-terminal tail that appends the conserved PL homology domain (PHD) and is important for function. Here, we report a 2.3-Å resolution crystal structure of Drosophila CRY with an intact C terminus. The C-terminal helix docks in the analogous groove that binds DNA substrates in PLs. Conserved Trp 536 juts into the CRY catalytic centre to mimic PL recognition of DNA photolesions. The FAD anionic semiquinone found in the crystals assumes a conformation to facilitate restructuring of the tail helix. These results help reconcile the diverse functions of the CRY/PL family by demonstrating how conserved protein architecture and photochemistry can be elaborated into a range of light-driven functions.	0
Title: Identification and transcriptional organization of a gene cluster involved in biosynthesis and transport of acinetobactin, a siderophore produced by Acinetobacter baumannii ATCC 19606T Abstract: In order to assimilate iron, Acinetobacter baumannii ATCC 19606(T) produces a siderophore named acinetobactin (Ab) that is composed of equimolar quantities of 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid (DHBA), L-threonine and N-hydroxyhistamine. Application of the Fur titration assay system to A. baumannii genomic libraries, followed by further cloning of the regions surrounding the candidate genes, led to the identification of the Ab cluster, which harbours the genetic determinants necessary for the biosynthesis and transport of the siderophore. However, an entA homologue essential for DHBA biosynthesis was not found in this cluster. Functions of potential biosynthetic genes inferred by homology studies suggested that the precursors, DHBA, l-threonine and N-hydroxyhistamine, are linked in steps resembling those of bacterial non-ribosomal peptide synthesis to form Ab. Genes responsible for the two-step biosynthesis of N-hydroxyhistamine from histidine were also identified in this cluster. Their genetic organization suggests that five genes involved in the transport system of ferric Ab into the cell cytosol form an operon. Construction of disruptants of some selected genes followed by phenotypic analysis supported their predicted biological functions. Interestingly, three additional genes probably involved in the intracellular release of iron from ferric Ab and the secretion of nascent Ab are contained in this cluster. Primer extension and RT-PCR analyses suggested that the Ab cluster, which includes 18 genes, is organized in seven transcriptional units originating from respective Fur-regulated promoter-operator regions.	1
Title: Cystobactamids: myxobacterial topoisomerase inhibitors exhibiting potent antibacterial activity Abstract: The development of new antibiotics faces a severe crisis inter alia owing to a lack of innovative chemical scaffolds with activities against Gram-negative and multiresistant pathogens. Herein, we report highly potent novel antibacterial compounds, the myxobacteria-derived cystobactamids 1-3, which were isolated from Cystobacter sp. and show minimum inhibitory concentrations in the low μg mL(-1) range. We describe the isolation and structure elucidation of three congeners as well as the identification and annotation of their biosynthetic gene cluster. By studying the self-resistance mechanism in the natural producer organism, the molecular targets were identified as bacterial type IIa topoisomerases. As quinolones are largely exhausted as a template for new type II topoisomerase inhibitors, the cystobactamids offer exciting alternatives to generate novel antibiotics using medicinal chemistry and biosynthetic engineering.	1
Title: Non-traditional roles of G protein-coupled receptors in basic cell biology Abstract: G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are key signaling proteins that regulate how cells interact with their environment. Traditional signaling cascades involving GPCRs have been well described and are well established and very important clinical targets. With the development of more recent technologies, hints about the involvement of GPCRs in fundamental cell biological processes are beginning to emerge. In this review, we give a basic introduction to GPCR signaling and highlight some less well described roles of GPCRs, including in cell division and membrane trafficking, which may occur through canonical and non-canonical signaling pathways.	0
Title: Real-time PCR assay to differentiate Listeriolysin S-positive and -negative strains of Listeria monocytogenes Abstract: Due to the severity of the food-borne infection listeriosis, strict legislation governs the detectable and permissible limits at which Listeria monocytogenes is permitted in foods. These requirements, coupled with the ubiquitous nature of L. monocytogenes strains and the potential for epidemic outbreaks, mean that the pathogen can devastate affected sectors of the food industry. Although almost all L. monocytogenes strains have the potential to cause listeriosis, those implicated in the vast majority of epidemics belong to a subset of strains belonging to evolutionary lineage I. It has been established that a significant proportion of these strains, including those implicated in the majority of outbreaks, produce an additional hemolysin, designated listeriolysin S (LLS), which may be responsible for the enhanced virulence of these strains. In order to ultimately establish this definitively, it is important to first be able to rapidly discriminate between LLS-positive and -negative strains. Here, after essential genes within the LLS-encoding cluster, Listeria pathogenicity island 3, were identified by deletion mutagenesis, a real-time PCR assay which targets one such gene, llsX, was developed as a means of identifying LLS-positive L. monocytogenes. The specificity of the assay was validated against a panel of 40 L. monocytogenes strains (20 of which were LLS positive) and 25 strains representative of other Listeria species. Furthermore, 1 CFU of an LLS-positive strain per 25 g/ml of spiked foods was detected in less than 30 h when the assay was coupled with culture enrichment. The detection limit of this assay was 10 genome equivalents.	1
Title: Structural characterization of the surface-associated heteropolysaccharide of Lactobacillus plantarum TMW 1.1478 and genetic analysis of its putative biosynthesis cluster Abstract: Microbial exopolysaccharides (EPS) like xanthan are widely exploited as natural biopolymers in diverse industrial sectors. In foods, in-situ EPS formation by starter cultures allows the manufacturing of "clean labeled" products with improved textural and nutritional properties. We performed structural analyses of the cell surface-associated EPS produced by Lactobacillus plantarum TMW 1.1478, which is a promising starter culture for fermented foods. Chromatographic analyses and NMR experiments suggested an acetylated heptameric repeating unit comprised of glucose, rhamnose and galactose as major components, whereas analysis of the macromolecular HePS structure suggested an apparent molecular mass of Mr ∼2 × 106 and a root mean square (RMS) radius of ca. 60 nm. Genetic analyses enabled the identification of the respective EPS biosynthesis cluster, and its modular organization supports the chemically identified, novel EPS structure. The obtained results broaden the understanding of complex EPS formation from activated sugar nucleotides by Lactobacillus plantarum.	1
Title: Identification of the Scopularide Biosynthetic Gene Cluster in Scopulariopsis brevicaulis Abstract: Scopularide A is a promising potent anticancer lipopeptide isolated from a marine derived Scopulariopsis brevicaulis strain. The compound consists of a reduced carbon chain (3-hydroxy-methyldecanoyl) attached to five amino acids (glycine, l-valine, d-leucine, l-alanine, and l-phenylalanine). Using the newly sequenced S. brevicaulis genome we were able to identify the putative biosynthetic gene cluster using genetic information from the structurally related emericellamide A from Aspergillus nidulans and W493-B from Fusarium pseudograminearum. The scopularide A gene cluster includes a nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS1), a polyketide synthase (PKS2), a CoA ligase, an acyltransferase, and a transcription factor. Homologous recombination was low in S. brevicaulis so the local transcription factor was integrated randomly under a constitutive promoter, which led to a three to four-fold increase in scopularide A production. This indirectly verifies the identity of the proposed biosynthetic gene cluster.	1
Title: Nickel-Catalyzed Chemo- and Enantioselective Coupling between Cyclobutanones and Allenes: Rapid Synthesis of [3.2.2] Bicycles Abstract: Herein an intramolecular nickel-catalyzed (4+2) coupling between cyclobutanones and allenes, by C-C cleavage, is reported. The reaction provides a distinct approach for accessing [3.2.2] bicyclic scaffolds which are challenging to prepare through conventional approaches. The reaction is efficient, chemoselective, and pH/redox neutral. Room temperature conditions and low catalyst loadings can be adopted. Excellent enantioselectivity is also achieved.	0
Title: Migratory Insertion of Carbenes into Au(III)-C Bonds Abstract: Migratory insertion of carbon-based species into transition-metal-carbon bonds is a mechanistic manifold of vast significance: it underlies the Fischer-Tropsch process, Mizoroki-Heck reaction, Ziegler-Natta and analogous late-transition-metal-catalyzed olefin polymerizations, and a number of carbonylative methods for the synthesis of ketones and esters, among others. Although this type of reactivity is well-precedented for most transition metals, gold constitutes a notable exception, with virtually no well-characterized examples known to date. Yet, the complementary reactivity of gold to numerous other transition metals would offer new synthetic opportunities for migratory insertion of carbon-based species into gold-carbon bonds. Here we report the discovery of well-defined Au(III) complexes that participate in rapid migratory insertion of carbenes derived from silyl- or carbonyl-stabilized diazoalkanes into Au-C bonds at temperatures ≥ -40 °C. Through a combined theoretical and experimental approach, key kinetic, thermodynamic, and structural details of this reaction manifold were elucidated. This study paves the way for homogeneous gold-catalyzed processes incorporating carbene migratory insertion steps.	0
Title: Fatty acids synthesized by oral treponemes in chemically defined media Abstract: OMIZ-W68, a chemically defined medium that contains no long-chain fatty acids and yet supports in vitro proliferation of a wide range of fastidious oral anaerobes, is described. The type strains of Treponema denticola, Treponema lecithinolyticum, Treponema maltophilum, Treponema pectinovorum, Treponema socranskii, and an as yet unpublished canine Treponema species could be propagated indefinitely in this medium with sugar supplements for the saccharolytic species. Analysis of the cellular fatty acids (CFA) of these treponemes by gas chromatography demonstrated the synthesis of C14, C15, C16, and C17 fatty acids (linear-, iso-, and anteiso-forms) in various proportions, but neither hydroxy- nor unsaturated fatty acids. However, between 0% and 40% of the eluted material could not be identified. The proportions of CFAs differed not only between species but also between the eight strains of Treponema denticola investigated. Replacing OMIZ-W68 by a derivative minimal essential medium (OMIZ-M/TDCDK) developed for Treponema denticola had little effect on the CFA profiles. In contrast, the CFA profiles of treponemes grown in OMIZ-W68 showed at best minor similarity to the strains from the Moore library of the Virginia Polytechnic Institute, which had been grown in media containing serum, peptones, and yeast extract.	0
Title: Isolation and structure determination of a new lantibiotic cinnamycin B from Actinomadura atramentaria based on genome mining Abstract: New lantibiotic cinnamycin B was isolated from the extract of Actinomadura atramentaria NBRC 14695(T), based on genome mining and chemical investigation. The partial structure of cinnamycin B was established by 2D NMR experiments, which indicated that cinnamycin B had same methyl lanthionine bridging pattern with cinnamycin. The reduction with NaBH4-NiCl2 afforded the reduced cinnamycin B, and MS/MS experiment indicated the presence of hydroxy asparatic acid in the molecule. Cinnamycin B showed an antibacterial activity against Streptomyces antibioticus with dosage of 5 μg (0.5μL, 10 mg/mL solution) at spot-on-lawn testing method. The gene cluster of cinnamycin B on the genome of A. atramentaria was identified and discussed in comparison with that of cinnamycin.	1
Title: The Biosynthesis of Lipooligosaccharide from Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron Abstract: Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a cell-associated glycolipid that makes up the outer leaflet of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria, is a canonical mediator of microbe-host interactions. The most prevalent Gram-negative gut bacterial taxon, Bacteroides, makes up around 50% of the cells in a typical Western gut; these cells harbor ~300 mg of LPS, making it one of the highest-abundance molecules in the intestine. As a starting point for understanding the biological function of Bacteroides LPS, we have identified genes in Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron VPI 5482 involved in the biosynthesis of its lipid A core and glycan, generated mutants that elaborate altered forms of LPS, and used matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry to interrogate the molecular features of these variants. We demonstrate, inter alia, that the glycan does not appear to have a repeating unit, and so this strain produces lipooligosaccharide (LOS) rather than LPS. This result contrasts with Bacteroides vulgatus ATCC 8482, which by SDS-PAGE analysis appears to produce LPS with a repeating unit. Additionally, our identification of the B. thetaiotaomicron LOS oligosaccharide gene cluster allowed us to identify similar clusters in other Bacteroides species. Our work lays the foundation for developing a structure-function relationship for Bacteroides LPS/LOS in the context of host colonization.IMPORTANCE Much is known about the bacterial species and genes that make up the human microbiome, but remarkably little is known about the molecular mechanisms through which the microbiota influences host biology. A well-known mechanism by which bacteria influence the host centers around lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a component of the Gram-negative bacterial outer membrane. Pathogen-derived LPS is a potent ligand for host receptor Toll-like receptor 4, which plays an important role in sensing bacteria as part of the innate immune response. Puzzlingly, the most common genus of human gut bacteria, Bacteroides, produces LPS but does not elicit a potent proinflammatory response. Previous work showing that Bacteroides LPS differs structurally from pathogen-derived LPS suggested the outlines of an explanation. Here, we take the next step, elucidating the biosynthetic pathway for Bacteroides LPS and generating mutants in the process that will be of great use in understanding how this molecule modulates the host immune response.	1
Title: Natural Occurrence of Hybrid Polyketides from Two Distinct Biosynthetic Pathways in Streptomyces pactum Abstract: Nature has always been seemingly limitless in its ability to create new chemical entities. It provides vastly diverse natural compounds through a biomanufacturing process that involves myriads of biosynthetic machineries. Here we report a case of unusual formations of hybrid natural products that are derived from two distinct polyketide biosynthetic pathways, the NFAT-133 and conglobatin pathways, in Streptomyces pactum ATCC 27456. Their chemical structures were determined by NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, and chemical synthesis. Genome sequence analysis and gene inactivation experiments uncovered the biosynthetic gene cluster of conglobatin in S. pactum. Biochemical studies of the recombinant thioesterase (TE) domain of the conglobatin polyketide synthase (PKS) as well as its S74A mutant revealed that the formation of these hybrid compounds requires an active TE domain. We propose that NFAT-133 can interfere with conglobatin biosynthesis by reacting with the TE-domain-bound intermediates in the conglobatin PKS assembly line to form hybrid NFAT-133/conglobatin products.	0
Title: Targeting mitochondrial DNA with a platinum-based anticancer agent Abstract: An analog of the anticancer drug cisplatin (mtPt) was delivered to mitochondria of human cells using a peptide specifically targeting this organelle. mtPt induces apoptosis without damaging nuclear DNA, indicating that mtDNA damage is sufficient to mediate the activity of a platinum-based chemotherapeutic. This study demonstrates the specific delivery of a platinum drug to mitochondria and investigates the effects of directing this agent outside the nucleus.	0
Title: Cycloaspeptides F and G, Cyclic Pentapeptides from a Cordyceps-colonizing isolate of Isaria farinosa Abstract: Cycloaspeptides F (1) and G (2), two new cyclic pentapeptides, and the known cycloaspeptides A (3), C (4), and bisdethiodi(methylthio)hyalodendrin (5) have been isolated from the crude extract of the fungus Isaria farinosa that colonizes Cordyceps sinensis. The structures of 1 and 2 were elucidated primarily by NMR and MS methods. The absolute configuration of 1 was assigned using Marfey's method on its acid hydrolysate. Compounds 1 and 2 showed cytotoxic effects against HeLa and MCF7 cell lines, displaying the same magnitude of activity toward the MCF7 cells as the positive control 5-fluorouracil.	0
Title: Role of MbtH-like proteins in the adenylation of tyrosine during aminocoumarin and vancomycin biosynthesis Abstract: MbtH-like proteins consist of ∼70 amino acids and are encoded in the biosynthetic gene clusters of non-ribosomally formed peptides and other secondary metabolites derived from amino acids. Recently, several MbtH-like proteins have been shown to be required for the adenylation of amino acid in non-ribosomal peptide synthesis. We now investigated the role of MbtH-like proteins in the biosynthesis of the aminocoumarin antibiotics novobiocin, clorobiocin, and simocyclinone D8 and of the glycopeptide antibiotic vancomycin. The tyrosine-adenylating enzymes CloH, SimH, and Pcza361.18, involved in the biosynthesis of clorobiocin, simocyclinone D8, and vancomycin, respectively, required the presence of MbtH-like proteins in a 1:1 molar ratio, forming heterotetrameric complexes. In contrast, NovH, involved in novobiocin biosynthesis, showed activity in the absence of MbtH-like proteins. Comparison of the active centers of CloH and NovH showed only one amino acid to be different, i.e. Leu-383 versus Met-383. Mutation of this amino acid in CloH (L383M) indeed led to MbtH-independent adenylating activity. All investigated tyrosine-adenylating enzymes exhibited remarkable promiscuity for MbtH-like proteins from different pathways and organisms. YbdZ, the MbtH-like protein from the expression host Escherichia coli, was found to bind to adenylating enzymes during expression and to influence their biochemical properties markedly. Therefore, the use of ybdZ-deficient expression hosts is important in biochemical studies of adenylating enzymes.	1
Title: Mammalian target of Rapamycin inhibition and mycobacterial survival are uncoupled in murine macrophages Abstract: Background:                       Autophagy is a cellular response to intracellular pathogens including mycobacteria and is induced by the direct inhibitors of mammalian target of Rapamycin (mTOR), a major negative regulator of autophagy. Autophagy induction by mTOR inhibition (mTOR dependent autophagy), through chemical means or starvation, leads to mycobacterial killing in infected cells. However, previous work by our group has shown that mycobacterial infection of macrophages naturally induces both autophagy and mammalian target of Rapamycin (mTOR) activity (mTOR independent autophagy). In the current work, we further explore the relationship between mTOR activity and mycobacterial killing in macrophages.                  Results:                       While low concentrations of the mTOR inhibitors, Rapamycin, Torin 1, and Torin 2, can effectively reduce or block mTOR activity in response to lipopolysaccharides (LPS) or mycobacteria, higher concentrations (10 uM) are required to observe Mycobacterium smegmatis killing. The growth of M. smegmatis was also inhibited by high concentrations of Rapamycin in LC3B and ATG5 deficient bone marrow derived macrophages, suggesting that non-autophagic mechanisms might contribute to killing at high doses. Since mycobacterial killing could be observed only at fairly high concentrations of the mTOR inhibitors, exceeding doses necessary to inhibit mTOR, we hypothesized that high doses of Rapamycin, the most commonly utilized mTOR inhibitor for inducing autophagic killing, may exert a direct bactericidal effect on the mycobacteria. Although a short-term treatment of mycobacteria with Rapamycin did not substantially affect mycobacterial growth, a long-term exposure to Rapamycin could impact mycobacterial growth in vitro in select species.                  Conclusions:                       This data, coupled with previous work from our laboratory, further indicates that autophagy induction by mTOR inhibition is an artificial means to increase mycobacterial killing and masks more relevant endogenous autophagic biochemistry that needs to be understood.	0
Title: Constructing de novo H2O2 signaling via induced protein proximity Abstract: A new chemical strategy has been developed to generate de novo signaling pathways that link a signaling molecule, H2O2, to different downstream cellular events in mammalian cells. This approach combines the reactivity-based H2O2 sensing with the chemically induced protein proximity technology. By chemically modifying abscisic acid with an H2O2-sensitive boronate ester probe, novel H2O2 signaling pathways can be engineered to induce transcription, protein translocation and membrane ruffle formation upon exogenous or endogenous H2O2 stimulation. This strategy has also been successfully applied to gibberellic acid, which provides the potential to build signaling networks based on orthogonal cell stimuli.	0
Title: The electrophilic and leaving group phosphates in the catalytic mechanism of yeast pyrophosphatase Abstract: Binding of pyrophosphate or two phosphate molecules to the pyrophosphatase (PPase) active site occurs at two subsites, P1 and P2. Mutations at P2 subsite residues (Y93F and K56R) caused a much greater decrease in phosphate binding affinity of yeast PPase in the presence of Mn(2+) or Co(2+) than mutations at P1 subsite residues (R78K and K193R). Phosphate binding was estimated in these experiments from the inhibition of ATP hydrolysis at a sub-K(m) concentration of ATP. Tight phosphate binding required four Mn(2+) ions/active site. These data identify P2 as the high affinity subsite and P1 as the low affinity subsite, the difference in the affinities being at least 250-fold. The time course of five "isotopomers" of phosphate that have from zero to four (18)O during [(18)O]P(i)-[(16)O]H(2)O oxygen exchange indicated that the phosphate containing added water is released after the leaving group phosphate during pyrophosphate hydrolysis. These findings provide support for the structure-based mechanism in which pyrophosphate hydrolysis involves water attack on the phosphorus atom located at the P2 subsite of PPase.	0
Title: Penetration of beta-lactam antibiotics into their target enzymes in Pseudomonas aeruginosa: comparison of a highly sensitive mutant with its parent strain Abstract: Pseudomonas aeruginosa K 799/WT and a mutant of this strain, P. aeruginosa K 799/61 ("mutant 61"), that is very sensitive to most beta-lactam antibiotics tested were used to assess the importance of penetration barriers in the resistance of P. aeruginosa to penicillins and cephalosporins. The affinities of various beta-lactams to the penicillin-binding proteins found in membranes prepared from both strains were compared by measuring their competition for the binding of benzyl[14C] penicillin to each of these proteins. Only minor differences between the wild type and the mutant 61 were found. The high sensitivity of the mutant therefore cannot be attributed to drastic alterations of these target proteins, nor can the resistance of the wild type be ascribed to penicillin-binding proteins with low affinities for beta-lactams. Experiments in which the ease of penetration of beta-lactams into the penicillin-binding proteins was measured with exponentially growing intact cells instead of membranes, however, clearly demonstrated an easy access of beta-lactam antibiotics to these proteins in the mutant and an efficient exclusion from the same targets in the wild type.	0
Title: Characterization of Histidine Functionalization and Its Timing in the Biosynthesis of Ribosomally Synthesized and Posttranslationally Modified Thioamitides Abstract: Thioamitides are ribosomally synthesized and posttranslationally modified peptide (RiPP) natural products that hold great potential in anticancer drug development. Members in this RiPP family feature a thioamidated peptidyl chain conjugated with a macrocyclic ring system that contains two nonproteinogenic residues, 2-aminovinyl-cysteine (AviCys) and β-hydroxy-N,N-dimethyl-l-histidine (hdmHis). Focusing on the hdmHis residue that is unique to thioamitides, we report the enzymatic process for His functionalization and, more importantly, the timing of its related reactions with the other posttranslational modifications (PTMs) involved in thioamitide biosynthesis. His functionalization involves the activities of an S-adenosyl-l-methionine-dependent protein and a 2-oxoglutarate-Fe(II) monooxygenase for His bis-N-dimethylation and subsequent β-hydroxylation in a highly ordered manner. This process relies on the leader peptide sequence of the precursor peptide and on the establishment of the AviCys-containing, C-terminal macrocyclic ring system in particular. In contrast, prior peptide thioamidation is not required. Knowledge gained from the catalytic logic, specificity, and compatibility of His functionalization greatly furthers our understanding of the process through which nature develops thioamitides from a ribosomally synthesized peptide precursor.	1
Title: A natural short pathway synthesizes roquefortine C but not meleagrin in three different Penicillium roqueforti strains Abstract: The production of mycotoxins and other secondary metabolites in Penicillium roqueforti is of great interest because of its long history of use in blue-veined cheese manufacture. In this article, we report the cloning and characterization of the roquefortine gene cluster in three different P. roqueforti strains isolated from blue cheese in the USA (the type strain), France, and the UK (Cheshire cheese). All three strains showed an identical roquefortine gene cluster organization and almost identical (98-99%) gene nucleotide sequences in the entire 16.6-kb cluster region. When compared with the Penicillium chrysogenum roquefortine/meleagrin seven-gene cluster, the P. roqueforti roquefortine cluster contains only four genes (rds, rdh, rpt, and gmt) encoding the roquefortine dipeptide synthetase, roquefortine D dehydrogenase, roquefortine prenyltransferase, and a methyltransferase, respectively. Silencing of the rds or rpt genes by the RNAi strategy reduced roquefortine C production by 50% confirming the involvement of these two key genes in roquefortine biosynthesis. An additional putative gene, orthologous of the MFS transporter roqT, is rearranged in all three strains as a pseudogene. The same four genes and a complete (not rearranged) roqT, encoding a MFS transporter containing 12 TMS domains, occur in the seven-gene cluster in P. chrysogenum although organized differently. Interestingly, the two "late" genes of the P. chrysogenum roquefortine/meleagrin gene cluster that convert roquefortine C to glandicoline B and meleagrin are absent in the P. roqueforti four-gene cluster. No meleagrin production was detected in P. roqueforti cultures grown in YES medium, while P. chrysogenum produces meleagrin in these conditions. No orthologous genes of the two missing meleagrin synthesizing genes were found elsewhere in the recently released P. roqueforti genome. Our data suggest that during evolution, the seven-gene cluster present in P. chrysogenum, and probably also in other glandicoline/meleagrin producing fungi, has been trimmed down to a short cluster in P. roqueforti leading to the synthesis of roquefortine C rather than meleagrin as a final product.	1
Title: Structural specificity for biological activity of trichostatin A, a specific inhibitor of mammalian cell cycle with potent differentiation-inducing activity in Friend leukemia cells Abstract: Biological activities of four chemically synthesized trichostatin-related compounds, (R)-trichostatin A, (S)-trichostatin A, (R)-trichostatic acid, and (S)-trichostatic acid, were investigated. Assays of differentiation-inducing activity in Friend leukemia cells and G2-arresting activity in the cell cycle of normal rat fibroblast cells were used as monitoring systems for comparing the bioactivities of these compounds. The results clearly showed that both of the enantiomers of trichostatic acid had no activity in both the assay systems. In the case of (S)-trichostatin A, the antipode of naturally occurring trichostatin A, 50% effective concentrations were determined to be 50-70-fold higher than those of (R)-trichostatin A. The relationship between this ratio and the value of enantiomeric excess strongly suggests that (S)-trichostatin A is also biologically inactive. These results indicate that the absolute configuration and the presence of the hydroxamate group of trichostatin A are essential for its biological activity.	0
Title: Cloning and heterologous expression of three type II PKS gene clusters from Streptomyces bottropensis Abstract: Mensacarcin is a potent cytotoxic agent isolated from Streptomyces bottropensis. It possesses a high content of oxygen atoms and two epoxide groups, and shows cytostatic and cytotoxic activity comparable to that of doxorubicin, a widely used drug for antitumor therapy. Another natural compound, rishirilide A, was also isolated from the fermentation broth of S. bottropensis. Screening a cosmid library of S. bottropensis with minimal PKS-gene-specific primers revealed the presence of three different type II polyketide synthase (PKS) gene clusters in this strain: the msn cluster (mensacarcin biosynthesis), the rsl cluster (rishirilide biosynthesis), and the mec cluster (putative spore pigment biosynthesis). Interestingly, luciferase-like oxygenases, which are very rare in Streptomyces species, are enriched in both the msn cluster and the rsl cluster. Three cosmids, cos2 (containing the major part of the msn cluster), cos3 (harboring the mec cluster), and cos4 (spanning probably the whole rsl cluster) were introduced into the general heterologous host Streptomyces albus by intergeneric conjugation. Expression of cos2 and cos4 in S. albus led to the production of didesmethylmensacarcin (DDMM, a precursor of mensacarcin) and the production of rishirilide A and B (a precursor of rishirilide A), respectively. However, no product was detected from the expression of cos3. In addition, based on the results of isotope-feeding experiments in S. bottropensis, a putative biosynthesis pathway for mensacarcin is proposed.	1
Title: Foreign insect hormones stimulating the transcription of the ie-1 promoter of Bombyx mori nuclear polyhedrosis virus in vivo and in vitro Abstract: Via a transient expression assay system, an experimental study was undertaken to characterize the effects of insect ecdysone and juvenile hormone analogue on the transient expression of the luciferase gene under the control of the immediate-early gene (ie-1) promoter of Bombyx mori nuclear polyhedrosis virus. The results demonstrated that the transcriptional activity of the ie-1 promoter was increased to a certain extent by different insect hormone treatments in uninfected insect cells or fifth instar silkworm larvae transfected with a plasmid containing a luciferase gene driven by the ie-1 promoter. By ecdysone treatment alone, an increase of 5-7 fold was reached in Bm-N, or Bm-5 cells, or in the early developmental stage of fifth instar larvae. By treatment with juvenile hormone analogue alone, about 2-fold, in Bm-N, Bm-5, and Sf-21 cells, or about 5-fold increase in the middle developmental stage of larvae was given, respectively. By co-treatment with ecdysone and juvenile hormone analogue, the incease was given between that of ecdysone and juvenile hormone analogue treatment alone. In addition, the synergistic effects of foreign/endogenous hormones on the activity of ie-1 promoter are discussed.	0
Title: Elucidation of the final reactions of DIMBOA-glucoside biosynthesis in maize: characterization of Bx6 and Bx7 Abstract: Benzoxazinoids were identified in the early 1960s as secondary metabolites of the grasses that function as natural pesticides and exhibit allelopathic properties. Benzoxazinoids are synthesized in seedlings and stored as glucosides (glcs); the main aglucone moieties are 2,4-dihydroxy-2H-1,4-benzoxazin-3(4H)-one (DIBOA) and 2,4-dihydroxy-7-methoxy-2H-1,4-benzoxazin-3(4H)-one (DIMBOA). The genes of DIBOA-glc biosynthesis have previously been isolated and the enzymatic functions characterized. Here, the enzymes for conversion of DIBOA-glc to DIMBOA-glc are identified. DIBOA-glc is the substrate of the dioxygenase BENZOXAZINLESS6 (BX6) and the produced 2,4,7-trihydroxy-2H-1,4-benzoxazin-3-(4H)-one-glc is metabolized by the methyltransferase BX7 to yield DIMBOA-glc. Both enzymes exhibit moderate K(m) values (below 0.4 mm) and k(cat) values of 2.10 s(-1) and 0.25 s(-1), respectively. Although BX6 uses a glucosylated substrate, our localization studies indicate a cytoplasmic localization of the dioxygenase. Bx6 and Bx7 are highest expressed in seedling tissue, a feature shared with the other Bx genes. At present, Bx6 and Bx7 have no close relatives among the members of their respective gene families. Bx6 and Bx7 map to the cluster of Bx genes on the short arm of chromosome 4.	1
Title: Carbon Monoxide, Hydrogen, and Formate Metabolism during Methanogenesis from Acetate by Thermophilic Cultures of Methanosarcina and Methanothrix Strains Abstract: CO and H(2) have been implicated in methanogenesis from acetate, but it is unclear whether they are directly involved in methanogenesis or electron transfer in acetotrophic methanogens. We compared metabolism of H(2), CO, and formate by cultures of the thermophilic acetotrophic methanogens Methanosarcina thermophila TM-1 and Methanothrix sp. strain CALS-1. M. thermophila accumulated H(2) to partial pressures of 40 to 70 Pa (1 Pa = 0.987 x 10 atm), as has been previously reported for this and other Methanosarcina cultures. In contrast, Methanothrix sp. strain CALS-1 accumulated H(2) to maximum partial pressures near 1 Pa. Growing cultures of Methanothrix sp. strain CALS-1 initially accumulated CO, which reached partial pressures near 0.6 Pa (some CO came from the rubber stopper) during the middle of methanogenesis; this was followed by a decrease in CO partial pressures to less than 0.01 Pa by the end of methanogenesis. Accumulation or consumption of CO by cultures of M. thermophila growing on acetate was not detected. Late-exponential-phase cultures of Methanothrix sp. strain CALS-1, in which the CO partial pressure was decreased by flushing with N(2)-CO(2), accumulated CO to 0.16 Pa, whereas cultures to which ca. 0.5 Pa of CO was added consumed CO until it reached this partial pressure. Cyanide (1 mM) blocked CO consumption but not production. High partial pressures of H(2) (40 kPa) inhibited methanogenesis from acetate by M. thermophila but not by Methanothrix sp. strain CALS-1, and 2 kPa of CO was not inhibitory to M. thermophila but was inhibitory to Methanothrix sp. strain CALS-1. Levels of CO dehydrogenase, hydrogenase, and formate dehydrogenase in Methanothrix sp. strain CALS-1 were 9.1, 0.045, and 5.8 mumol of viologen reduced min mg of protein. These results suggest that CO plays a role in Methanothrix sp. strain CALS-1 similar to that of H(2) in M. thermophila and are consistent with the conclusion that CO is an intermediate in a catabolic or anabolic pathway in Methanothrix sp. strain CALS-1; however, they could also be explained by passive equilibration of CO with a metabolic intermediate.	0
Title: Biosynthesis of an anti-tuberculosis sesterterpenoid asperterpenoid A Abstract: A putative three-gene cluster for asperterpenoid A was identified. Step-wise reconstitution of this gene cluster in Aspergillus oryzae reveals that astC encodes a sesterterpene cyclase to synthesize preasperterpenoid A, which is dually oxidized by a P450 enzyme AstB to give asperterpenoid A along with a minor product asperterpenoid B, and asperterpenoid A is further oxidized by another P450 eznyme AstA to afford a new sesterterpenoid asperterpenoid C. Unexpectedly, asperterpenoids A and B, but not the final product asperterpenoid C, exhibit potent inhibitory activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis protein tyrosine phosphatase B with IC50 values of 3-6 μM.	1
Title: Gibepyrone Biosynthesis in the Rice Pathogen Fusarium fujikuroi Is Facilitated by a Small Polyketide Synthase Gene Cluster Abstract: The 2H-pyran-2-one gibepyrone A and its oxidized derivatives gibepyrones B-F have been isolated from the rice pathogenic fungus Fusarium fujikuroi already more than 20 years ago. However, these products have not been linked to the respective biosynthetic genes, and therefore, their biosynthesis has not yet been analyzed on a molecular level. Feeding experiments with isotopically labeled precursors clearly supported a polyketide origin for the formal monoterpenoid gibepyrone A, whereas the terpenoid pathway could be excluded. Targeted gene deletion verified that the F. fujikuroi polyketide synthase PKS13, designated Gpy1, is responsible for gibepyrone A biosynthesis. Next to Gpy1, the ATP-binding cassette transporter Gpy2 is encoded by the gibepyrone gene cluster. Gpy2 was shown to have only a minor impact on the actual efflux of gibepyrone A out of the cell. Instead, we obtained evidence that Gpy2 is involved in gene regulation as it represses GPY1 gene expression. Thus, GPY1 was up-regulated and gibepyrone A production was enhanced both extra- and intracellularly in Δgpy2 mutants. Furthermore, expression of GPY genes is strictly repressed by members of the fungus-specific velvet complex, Vel1, Vel2, and Lae1, whereas Sge1, a major regulator of secondary metabolism in F. fujikuroi, affects gibepyrone biosynthesis in a positive manner. The gibepyrone A derivatives gibepyrones B and D were shown to be produced by cluster-independent P450 monooxygenases, probably to protect the fungus from the toxic product. In contrast, the formation of gibepyrones E and F from gibepyrone A is a spontaneous process and independent of enzymatic activity.	1
Title: In Vivo Profiling of a Natural Alkaloid, Anatabine, in Rodents: Pharmacokinetics and Anti-Inflammatory Efficacy Abstract: Natural alkaloids, a large class of plant-derived substances, have attracted considerable interest because of their pharmacological activities. In this study, the in vivo pharmacokinetics and anti-inflammatory profile of anatabine, a naturally occurring alkaloid, were characterized in rodents. Anatabine was found to be bioavailable and brain-penetrant following systemic administration. Following intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration (1, 2, and 5 mg/kg), anatabine caused a dose-dependent reduction in carrageenan-induced paw edema in rats; in mice, it inhibited the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and simultaneously elevated the levels of an anti-inflammatory cytokine in a dose-dependent manner 2 h after lipopolysaccharide challenge. Furthermore, anatabine (∼10 and ∼20 mg/kg/day for 4 weeks; inhalation exposure) had effects in a murine model of multiple sclerosis, reducing neurological deficits and bodyweight loss. Comparative studies of the pharmacokinetics and anti-inflammatory activity of anatabine demonstrated its bioequivalence in rats following i.p. administration and inhalation exposure. This study not only provides the first detailed profile of anatabine pharmacokinetics in rodents but also comprehensively characterizes the anti-inflammatory activities of anatabine in acute and chronic inflammatory models. These findings provide a basis for further characterizing and optimizing the anti-inflammatory properties of anatabine.	0
Title: Palladium-catalyzed C3-benzylation of indoles Abstract: A general method for regioselective C3-benzylation of indoles has been developed.

Title: Cloning, expression, and nucleotide sequence of genes involved in production of lactococcin DR, a bacteriocin from lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis Abstract: The partial nucleotide sequence of a Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis ADRIA 85LO30 bacteriocin-producing operon was determined. The first two open reading frames of the operon are necessary to get bacteriocin expression in L. lactis IL1403R.	1
Title: A Consensus Ochratoxin A Biosynthetic Pathway: Insights from the Genome Sequence of Aspergillus ochraceus and a Comparative Genomic Analysis Abstract: Ochratoxin A (OTA) is a toxic secondary metabolite produced by Aspergillus and Penicillium species that widely contaminates food and feed. We sequenced and assembled the complete ∼37-Mb genome of Aspergillusochraceus fc-1, a well-known producer of OTA. Key genes of the OTA biosynthetic pathway were identified by comparative genomic analyses with five other sequenced OTA-producing fungi: A. carbonarius, A. niger, A. steynii, A. westerdijkiae, and Penicillium nordicum OTA production was completely inhibited in the deletion mutants (ΔotaA, ΔotaB, ΔotaC, ΔotaD, and ΔotaR1), and OTA biosynthesis was restored by feeding a postblock substrate to the corresponding mutant. The OTA biosynthetic pathway was unblocked in the ΔotaD mutant by the addition of heterologously expressed halogenase. OTA biosynthesis begins with a polyketide synthase (PKS), OtaA, utilizing acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) and malonyl-CoA to synthesize 7-methylmellein, which is oxidized to OTβ by cytochrome P450 monooxygenase (OtaC). OTβ and l-β-phenylalanine are combined by a nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS), OtaB, to form an amide bond to synthesize OTB. Finally, OTB is chlorinated by a halogenase (OtaD) to OTA. The otaABCD genes were expressed at low levels in the ΔotaR1 mutant. A second regulator, otaR2, which is adjacent to the biosynthetic gene, could modulate only the expression of otaA, otaB, and otaD Thus, we have identified a consensus OTA biosynthetic pathway that can be used to prevent and control OTA synthesis and will help us understand the variation and production of the intermediate components in the biosynthetic pathway.IMPORTANCE Ochratoxin A (OTA) is a significant mycotoxin that contaminates cereal products, coffee, grapes, wine, cheese, and meat. OTA is nephrotoxic, carcinogenic, teratogenic, and immunotoxic. OTA contamination is a serious threat to food safety, endangers human health, and can cause huge economic losses. At present, >20 species of the genera Aspergillus and Penicillium are known to produce OTA. Here we demonstrate that a consensus OTA biosynthetic pathway exists in all OTA-producing fungi and is encoded by a gene cluster containing four highly conserved biosynthetic genes and a bZIP transcription factor.	1
Title: Indazole-type alkaloids from Nigella sativa seeds exhibit antihyperglycemic effects via AMPK activation in vitro Abstract: Six rare naturally occurring indazole-type alkaloids including two new compounds, 17-O-(β-d-glucopyranosyl)-4-O-methylnigellidine (1) and nigelanoid (2), and four known compounds (3-6) were isolated from a defatted extract of Nigella sativa (black cumin) seeds. 17-O-(β-d-Glucopyranosyl)-4-O-methylnigellidine (1) increased glucose consumption by liver hepatocytes (HepG2 cells) through activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Also, this is the first report of compounds 4 and 6 from a natural source.	0
Title: Multiple biosynthetic and uptake systems mediate siderophore-dependent iron acquisition in Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) and Streptomyces ambofaciens ATCC 23877 Abstract: Siderophore-mediated iron acquisition has been well studied in many bacterial pathogens because it contributes to virulence. In contrast, siderophore-mediated iron acquisition by saprophytic bacteria has received relatively little attention. The independent identification of the des and cch gene clusters that direct production of the tris-hydroxamate ferric iron-chelators desferrioxamine E and coelichelin, respectively, which could potentially act as siderophores in the saprophyte Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2), has recently been reported. Here it is shown that the des cluster also directs production of desferrioxamine B in S. coelicolor and that very similar des and cch clusters direct production of desferrioxamines E and B, and coelichelin, respectively, in Streptomyces ambofaciens ATCC 23877. Sequence analyses of the des and cch clusters suggest that components of ferric-siderophore uptake systems are also encoded within each cluster. The construction and analysis of a series of mutants of S. coelicolor lacking just biosynthetic genes or both the biosynthetic and siderophore uptake genes from the des and cch clusters demonstrated that coelichelin and desferrioxamines E and B all function as siderophores in this organism and that at least one of these metabolites is required for growth under defined conditions even in the presence of significant quantities of ferric iron. These experiments also demonstrated that a third siderophore uptake system must be present in S. coelicolor, in addition to the two encoded within the cch and des clusters, which show selectivity for coelichelin and desferrioxamine E, respectively. The ability of the S. coelicolor mutants to utilize a range of exogenous xenosiderophores for iron acquisition was also examined, showing that the third siderophore-iron transport system has broad specificity for tris-hydroxamate-containing siderophores. Together, these results define a complex system of multiple biosynthetic and uptake pathways for siderophore-mediated iron acquisition in S. coelicolor and S. ambofaciens.	1
Title: Functional analysis of genes from Streptomyces griseus involved in the synthesis of isorenieratene, a carotenoid with aromatic end groups, revealed a novel type of carotenoid desaturase Abstract: The biosynthesis of the aromatic carotene isorenieratene is restricted to green photosynthetic bacteria and a few actinomycetes. Among them Streptomyces griseus has been used to study the genes involved in this pathway. Five genes out of seven of two adjacent operons in one cluster could be identified to be sufficient for the synthesis of isorenieratene. Stepwise deletions of these genes demonstrated their participation in phytoene synthesis, phytoene desaturation and lycopene cyclization. The novel gene crtU was assigned to encode a unique desaturase responsible for the conversion of beta-carotene via beta-isorenieratene to isorenieratene by a desaturation/methyltransferation mechanism. Sequence analysis of crtU revealed two conserved regions, one at the N-terminus and the other at the C-terminus of the protein which is universal to different types of carotene desaturases. In addition, the sequence comprises a motif typically found in methyltransferases. The deletion of the two remaining genes of the cluster left the carotenoid biosynthetic pathway unaffected.	1
Title: Identification of the First Diketomorpholine Biosynthetic Pathway Using FAC-MS Technology Abstract: Filamentous fungi are prolific producers of secondary metabolites with drug-like properties, and their genome sequences have revealed an untapped wealth of potential therapeutic leads. To better access these secondary metabolites and characterize their biosynthetic gene clusters, we applied a new platform for screening and heterologous expression of intact gene clusters that uses fungal artificial chromosomes and metabolomic scoring (FAC-MS). We leverage FAC-MS technology to identify the biosynthetic machinery responsible for production of acu-dioxomorpholine, a metabolite produced by the fungus, Aspergilllus aculeatus. The acu-dioxomorpholine nonribosomal peptide synthetase features a new type of condensation domain (designated CR) proposed to use a noncanonical arginine active site for ester bond formation. Using stable isotope labeling and MS, we determine that a phenyllactate monomer deriving from phenylalanine is incorporated into the diketomorpholine scaffold. Acu-dioxomorpholine is highly related to orphan inhibitors of P-glycoprotein targets in multidrug-resistant cancers, and identification of the biosynthetic pathway for this compound class enables genome mining for additional derivatives.	1
Title: Characterization of a Hybrid Nonribosomal Peptide-Carbohydrate Biosynthetic Pathway in Photorhabdus luminescens Abstract: Advances in genome sequencing and analysis have afforded a trove of "orphan" bacterial biosynthetic pathways, many of which contain hypothetical proteins. Given the potential for these hypothetical proteins to carry out novel chemistry, orphan pathways serve as a rich reservoir for the discovery of new enzymes responsible for the production of metabolites with both fascinating chemistries and biological functions. We previously identified a rare hybrid nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS)-carbohydrate genomic island in the entomopathogen Photorhabdus luminescens. Heterologous expression of the pathway led to the characterization of oligosaccharides harboring a 1,6-anhydro-β-d- N-acetyl-glucosamine moiety, but these new metabolites lacked modification by the NRPS machinery. Here, through the application of top-down protein mass spectrometry, pathway-targeted molecular networking, stable isotope labeling, and in vitro protein biochemistry, we complete the characterization of this biosynthetic pathway and identify the hybrid product of the pathway, a new "glycoamino acid" metabolite termed photolose. Intriguingly, a hypothetical protein served as a bridge to condense a glycyl unit derived from the NRPS machinery onto the free 1,6-anhydro-β-d- N-acetyl-glucosamine core. We further demonstrate that the gene cluster confers a growth advantage to antimicrobial peptide challenge.	1
Title: Discovery of 23 natural tubulysins from Angiococcus disciformis An d48 and Cystobacter SBCb004 Abstract: The tubulysins are a family of complex peptides with promising cytotoxic activity against multi-drug-resistant tumors. To date, ten tubulysins have been described from the myxobacterial strains Angiococcus disciformis An d48 and Archangium gephyra Ar 315. We report here a third producing strain, Cystobacter sp. SBCb004. Comparison of the tubulysin biosynthetic gene clusters in SBCb004 and An d48 reveals a conserved architecture, allowing the assignment of cluster boundaries. A SBCb004 strain containing a mutant in the putative cyclodeaminase gene tubZ accumulates pretubulysin A, the proposed first enzyme-free intermediate in the pathway, whose structure we confirm by NMR. We further show, using a combination of feeding studies and structure elucidation by NMR and high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry, that SBCb004 and An d48 together biosynthesize 22 additional tubulysin derivatives. These data reveal the inherently diversity-oriented nature of the tubulysin biosynthetic pathway.	1
Title: A nonribosomal peptide synthetase-derived iron(III) complex from the pathogenic fungus Aspergillus fumigatus Abstract: Small molecules (SMs) play central roles as virulence factors of pathogenic fungi and bacteria; however, genomic analyses suggest that the majority of microbial SMs have remained uncharacterized. Based on microarray analysis followed by comparative metabolomics of overexpression/knockout mutants, we identified a tryptophan-derived iron(III)-complex, hexadehydro-astechrome (HAS), as the major product of the cryptic has nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) gene cluster in the human pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus. Activation of the has cluster created a highly virulent A. fumigatus strain that increased mortality of infected mice. Comparative metabolomics of different mutant strains allowed to propose a pathway for HAS biosynthesis and further revealed cross-talk with another NRPS pathway producing the anticancer fumitremorgins.	1
Title: Enzyme-catalysed [6+4] cycloadditions in the biosynthesis of natural products Abstract: Pericyclic reactions are powerful transformations for the construction of carbon-carbon and carbon-heteroatom bonds in organic synthesis. Their role in biosynthesis is increasingly apparent, and mechanisms by which pericyclases can catalyse reactions are of major interest1. [4+2] cycloadditions (Diels-Alder reactions) have been widely used in organic synthesis2 for the formation of six-membered rings and are now well-established in biosynthesis3-6. [6+4] and other 'higher-order' cycloadditions were predicted7 in 1965, and are now increasingly common in the laboratory despite challenges arising from the generation of a highly strained ten-membered ring system8,9. However, although enzyme-catalysed [6+4] cycloadditions have been proposed10-12, they have not been proven to occur. Here we demonstrate a group of enzymes that catalyse a pericyclic [6+4] cycloaddition, which is a crucial step in the biosynthesis of streptoseomycin-type natural products. This type of pericyclase catalyses [6+4] and [4+2] cycloadditions through a single ambimodal transition state, which is consistent with previous proposals11,12. The [6+4] product is transformed to a less stable [4+2] adduct via a facile Cope rearrangement, and the [4+2] adduct is converted into the natural product enzymatically. Crystal structures of three pericyclases, computational simulations of potential energies and molecular dynamics, and site-directed mutagenesis establish the mechanism of this transformation. This work shows how enzymes are able to catalyse concerted pericyclic reactions involving ambimodal transition states.	1
Title: Identification of mNeonGreen as a pH-Dependent, Turn-On Fluorescent Protein Sensor for Chloride Abstract: Chloride-sensitive fluorescent proteins generated from laboratory evolution have a characteristic tyrosine residue that interacts with a chloride ion and π-stacks with the chromophore. However, the engineered yellow-green fluorescent protein mNeonGreen lacks this interaction but still binds chloride, as seen in a recently reported crystal structure. Based on its unique coordination sphere, we were curious if chloride could influence the optical properties of mNeonGreen. Here, we present the structure-guided identification and spectroscopic characterization of mNeonGreen as a turn-on fluorescent protein sensor for chloride. Our results show that chloride binding lowers the chromophore pKa and shifts the equilibrium away from the weakly fluorescent phenol form to the highly fluorescent phenolate form, resulting in a pH-dependent, turn-on fluorescence response. Moreover, through mutagenesis, we link this sensing mechanism to a non-coordinating residue in the chloride binding pocket. This discovery sets the stage to further engineer mNeonGreen as a new fluorescent protein-based tool for imaging cellular chloride.	0
Title: Atlas of nonribosomal peptide and polyketide biosynthetic pathways reveals common occurrence of nonmodular enzymes Abstract: Nonribosomal peptides and polyketides are a diverse group of natural products with complex chemical structures and enormous pharmaceutical potential. They are synthesized on modular nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) and polyketide synthase (PKS) enzyme complexes by a conserved thiotemplate mechanism. Here, we report the widespread occurrence of NRPS and PKS genetic machinery across the three domains of life with the discovery of 3,339 gene clusters from 991 organisms, by examining a total of 2,699 genomes. These gene clusters display extraordinarily diverse organizations, and a total of 1,147 hybrid NRPS/PKS clusters were found. Surprisingly, 10% of bacterial gene clusters lacked modular organization, and instead catalytic domains were mostly encoded as separate proteins. The finding of common occurrence of nonmodular NRPS differs substantially from the current classification. Sequence analysis indicates that the evolution of NRPS machineries was driven by a combination of common descent and horizontal gene transfer. We identified related siderophore NRPS gene clusters that encoded modular and nonmodular NRPS enzymes organized in a gradient. A higher frequency of the NRPS and PKS gene clusters was detected from bacteria compared with archaea or eukarya. They commonly occurred in the phyla of Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, and Cyanobacteria in bacteria and the phylum of Ascomycota in fungi. The majority of these NRPS and PKS gene clusters have unknown end products highlighting the power of genome mining in identifying novel genetic machinery for the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites.	1
Title: The 32-kilobase exp gene cluster of Rhizobium meliloti directing the biosynthesis of galactoglucan: genetic organization and properties of the encoded gene products Abstract: Proteins directing the biosynthesis of galactoglucan (exopolysaccharide II) in Rhizobium meliloti Rm2011 are encoded by the exp genes. Sequence analysis of a 32-kb DNA fragment of megaplasmid 2 containing the exp gene cluster identified previously (J. Glazebrook and G. C. Walker, Cell 56:661-672, 1989) revealed the presence of 25 open reading frames. Homologies of the deduced exp gene products to proteins of known function suggested that the exp genes encoded four proteins involved in the biosynthesis of dTDP-glucose and dTDP-rhamnose, six glycosyltransferases, an ABC transporter complex homologous to the subfamily of peptide and protein export complexes, and a protein homologous to Rhizobium NodO proteins. In addition, homologies of three Exp proteins to transcriptional regulators, methyltransferases, and periplasmic binding proteins were found. The positions of 26 Tn5 insertions in the exp gene cluster were determined, thus allowing the previously described genetic map to be correlated with the sequence. Operon analysis revealed that the exp gene cluster consists of five complementation groups. In comparison to the wild-type background, all exp complementation groups were transcribed at a substantially elevated level in the regulatory mucR mutant.	1
Title: Cereulide synthetase gene cluster from emetic Bacillus cereus: structure and location on a mega virulence plasmid related to Bacillus anthracis toxin plasmid pXO1 Abstract: Background:                       Cereulide, a depsipeptide structurally related to valinomycin, is responsible for the emetic type of gastrointestinal disease caused by Bacillus cereus. Recently, it has been shown that this toxin is produced by a nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS), but its exact genetic organization and biochemical synthesis is unknown.                  Results:                       The complete sequence of the cereulide synthetase (ces) gene cluster, which encodes the enzymatic machinery required for the biosynthesis of cereulide, was dissected. The 24 kb ces gene cluster comprises 7 CDSs and includes, besides the typical NRPS genes like a phosphopantetheinyl transferase and two CDSs encoding enzyme modules for the activation and incorporation of monomers in the growing peptide chain, a CDS encoding a putative hydrolase in the upstream region and an ABC transporter in the downstream part. The enzyme modules responsible for incorporation of the hydroxyl acids showed an unusual structure while the modules responsible for the activation of the amino acids Ala and Val showed the typical domain organization of NRPS. The ces gene locus is flanked by genetic regions with high homology to virulence plasmids of B. cereus, Bacillus thuringiensis and Bacillus anthracis. PFGE and Southern hybridization showed that the ces genes are restricted to emetic B. cereus and indeed located on a 208 kb megaplasmid, which has high similarities to pXO1-like plasmids.                  Conclusion:                       The ces gene cluster that is located on a pXO1-like virulence plasmid represents, beside the insecticidal and the anthrax toxins, a third type of B. cereus group toxins encoded on megaplasmids. The ces genes are restricted to emetic toxin producers, but pXO1-like plasmids are also present in emetic-like strains. These data might indicate the presence of an ancient plasmid in B. cereus which has acquired different virulence genes over time. Due to the unusual structure of the hydroxyl acid incorporating enzyme modules of Ces, substantial biochemical efforts will be required to dissect the complete biochemical pathway of cereulide synthesis.	1
Title: Antibacterial Radicicol Analogues from Pochonia chlamydosporia and Their Biosynthetic Gene Cluster Abstract: Chemical investigation of fungus Pochonia chlamydosporia strain 170, derived from rice fermentation sediment samples, afforded seven radicicol analogues, including two new compounds, monocillin VI (1) and monocillin VII (2), and five known compounds, monocillin II (3), monorden D (4), monocillin IV (5), monocillin V (6), and pochonin M (7). The structures of compounds 1-7 were established primarily by analysis of nuclear magnetic resonance data, and the absolute configurations of the secondary alcohol in compounds 1 and 2 were assigned by the modified Mosher method. All seven compounds have modest antibacterial activities, with a minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 25.6 μg/mL for compounds 1 and 3-7 and 51.2 μg/mL for compound 2, on inhibition of the growth of the plant pathogen Xanthomonas campestris (the positive control ampicillin showed a MIC value of 12.8 μg/mL), indicating that the fungus has the potential to control bacterial disease. The biosynthetic gene cluster and putative biosynthetic pathways of these radicicol analogues in the P. chlamydosporia genome were proposed. These findings increase our knowledge of the chemical potential of P. chlamydosporia and may allow us to better utilize the fungus as a biological control agent.	1
Title: Gramillin A and B: Cyclic Lipopeptides Identified as the Nonribosomal Biosynthetic Products of Fusarium graminearum Abstract: The virulence and broad host range of Fusarium graminearum is associated with its ability to secrete an arsenal of phytotoxic secondary metabolites, including the regulated mycotoxins belonging to the deoxynivalenol family. The TRI genes responsible for the biosynthesis of deoxynivalenol and related compounds are usually expressed during fungal infection. However, the F. graminearum genome harbors an array of unexplored biosynthetic gene clusters that are also co-induced with the TRI genes, including the nonribosomal peptide synthetase 8 ( NRPS8) gene cluster. Here, we identify two bicyclic lipopeptides, gramillin A (1) and B (2), as the biosynthetic end products of NRPS8. Structural elucidation by high-resolution LC-MS and NMR, including 1H-15N-13C HNCO and HNCA on isotopically enriched compounds, revealed that the gramillins possess a fused bicyclic structure with ring closure of the main peptide macrocycle occurring via an anhydride bond. Through targeted gene disruption, we characterized the GRA1 biosynthetic gene and its transcription factor GRA2 in the NRPS8 gene cluster. Further, we show that the gramillins are produced in planta on maize silks, promoting fungal virulence on maize but have no discernible effect on wheat head infection. Leaf infiltration of the gramillins induces cell death in maize, but not in wheat. Our results show that F. graminearum deploys the gramillins as a virulence agent in maize, but not in wheat, thus displaying host-specific adaptation.	1
Title: Identification and characterization of the ergochrome gene cluster in the plant pathogenic fungus Claviceps purpurea Abstract: Background:          Claviceps purpurea is a phytopathogenic fungus infecting a broad range of grasses including economically important cereal crop plants. The infection cycle ends with the formation of the typical purple-black pigmented sclerotia containing the toxic ergot alkaloids. Besides these ergot alkaloids little is known about the secondary metabolism of the fungus. Red anthraquinone derivatives and yellow xanthone dimers (ergochromes) have been isolated from sclerotia and described as ergot pigments, but the corresponding gene cluster has remained unknown. Fungal pigments gain increasing interest for example as environmentally friendly alternatives to existing dyes. Furthermore, several pigments show biological activities and may have some pharmaceutical value.                  Results:                       This study identified the gene cluster responsible for the synthesis of the ergot pigments. Overexpression of the cluster-specific transcription factor led to activation of the gene cluster and to the production of several known ergot pigments. Knock out of the cluster key enzyme, a nonreducing polyketide synthase, clearly showed that this cluster is responsible for the production of red anthraquinones as well as yellow ergochromes. Furthermore, a tentative biosynthetic pathway for the ergot pigments is proposed. By changing the culture conditions, pigment production was activated in axenic culture so that high concentration of phosphate and low concentration of sucrose induced pigment syntheses.                  Conclusions:                       This is the first functional analysis of a secondary metabolite gene cluster in the ergot fungus besides that for the classical ergot alkaloids. We demonstrated that this gene cluster is responsible for the typical purple-black color of the ergot sclerotia and showed that the red and yellow ergot pigments are products of the same biosynthetic pathway. Activation of the gene cluster in axenic culture opened up new possibilities for biotechnological applications like the dye production or the development of new pharmaceuticals.	1
Title: A Pathogen-Responsive Gene Cluster for Highly Modified Fatty Acids in Tomato Abstract: In response to biotic stress, plants produce suites of highly modified fatty acids that bear unusual chemical functionalities. Despite their chemical complexity and proposed roles in pathogen defense, little is known about the biosynthesis of decorated fatty acids in plants. Falcarindiol is a prototypical acetylenic lipid present in carrot, tomato, and celery that inhibits growth of fungi and human cancer cell lines. Using a combination of untargeted metabolomics and RNA sequencing, we discovered a biosynthetic gene cluster in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) required for falcarindiol production. By reconstituting initial biosynthetic steps in a heterologous host and generating transgenic pathway mutants in tomato, we demonstrate a direct role of the cluster in falcarindiol biosynthesis and resistance to fungal and bacterial pathogens in tomato leaves. This work reveals a mechanism by which plants sculpt their lipid pool in response to pathogens and provides critical insight into the complex biochemistry of alkynyl lipid production.	1
Title: Calcium-dependent protein phosphorylation and dephosphorylation in intact brain neurons in culture Abstract: Preincubation of intact fetal rat brain neurons in culture with 32Pi results in the incorporation of 32Pi into about 20 specific proteins. Upon stimulation by electrical field stimulation or by K+-induced depolarization, highly significant calcium-dependent increase in phosphorylation of a protein of app. Mr 43 000 and decrease in phosphorylation of an app. Mr 55 000 protein occur. These changes can be attributed to the entry of Ca2+ into the cellular cytoplasm since they can occur upon selective permeabilization of the cell membrane to Ca2+ by the Ca2+-ionophore A23187 and are not observed upon stimulation of the cells in the presence of the Ca2+ channel blocker D-600. These data suggest that these phosphoproteins may be involved in the regulation of processes underlying neurotransmitter release.	0
Title: Reconstitution of functional mycobacterial arabinosyltransferase AftC proteoliposome and assessment of decaprenylphosphorylarabinose analogues as arabinofuranosyl donors Abstract: Arabinosyltransferases are a family of membrane-bound glycosyltransferases involved in the biosynthesis of the arabinan segment of two key glycoconjugates, arabinogalactan and lipoarabinomannan, in the mycobacterial cell wall. All arabinosyltransferases identified have been found to be essential for the growth of Mycobcterium tuberculosis and are potential targets for developing new antituberculosis drugs. Technical bottlenecks in designing enzyme assays for screening for inhibitors of these enzymes are (1) the enzymes are membrane proteins and refractory to isolation; and (2) the sole arabinose donor, decaprenylphosphoryl-d-arabinofuranose is sparingly produced and difficult to isolate, and commercial substrates are not available. In this study, we have synthesized several analogues of decaprenylphosphoryl-d-arabinofuranose by varying the chain length and investigated their arabinofuranose (Araf) donating capacity. In parallel, an essential arabinosyltransferase (AftC), an enzyme that introduces α-(1→3) branch points in the internal arabinan domain in both arabinogalactan and lipoarabinomannan synthesis, has been expressed, solubilized, and purified for the first time. More importantly, it has been shown that the AftC is active only when reconstituted in a proteoliposome using mycobacterial phospholipids and has a preference for diacylated phosphatidylinositoldimannoside (Ac(2)PIM(2)), a major cell wall associated glycolipid. α-(1→3) branched arabinans were generated when AftC-liposome complex was used in assays with the (Z,Z)-farnesylphosphoryl d-arabinose and linear α-d-Araf-(1→5)(3-5) oligosaccharide acceptors and not with the acceptor that had a α-(1→3) branch point preintroduced.	0
Title: A carotenogenic gene cluster from Brevibacterium linens with novel lycopene cyclase genes involved in the synthesis of aromatic carotenoids Abstract: The carotenogenic (crt) gene cluster from Brevibacterium linens, a member of the commercially important group of coryneform bacteria, was cloned and identified. An expression library of B. linens genes was constructed and a fragment of the crt cluster was obtained by functional complementation of a colourless B. flavum mutant, screening transformed cells for production of a yellow pigment. Subsequent screening of a cosmid library resulted in the cloning of the whole crt cluster from B. linens. All genes necessary for the synthesis of the aromatic carotenoid isorenieratene were identified on the basis of sequence homologies. In addition a novel type of lycopene cyclase was identified by complementation of a lycopene-accumulating B. flavum mutant. Two genes, named crt Yc and crt Yd, which code for polypeptides of 125 and 107 amino acids, respectively, are necessary to convert lycopene to beta-carotene. The amino acid sequences of these polypeptides show no similarity to any of the known lycopene cyclases. This is the first example of a carotenoid biosynthetic conversion in which two different gene products are involved, probably forming a heterodimer.	1
Title: A cryptic polyene biosynthetic gene cluster in Streptomyces calvus is expressed upon complementation with a functional bldA gene Abstract: Streptomyces calvus is best known as the producer of the fluorinated natural product nucleocidin. This strain of Streptomycetes is also unusual for displaying a "bald" phenotype that is deficient in the formation of aerial mycelium and spores. Genome sequencing of this organism revealed a point mutation in the bldA gene that is predicted to encode a misfolded Leu-tRNA(UUA) molecule. Complementation of S. calvus with a correct copy of bldA restored sporulation and additionally promoted production of a polyeneoic acid amide, 4-Z-annimycin, and a minor amount of the isomer, 4-E-annimycin. Bioassays reveal that these compounds inhibit morphological differentiation in other Actinobacteria. The annimycin gene cluster encoding a type 1 polyketide synthase was identified and verified through disruption studies. This study underscores the importance of the bldA gene in regulating the expression of cryptic biosynthetic genes.	1
Title: A novel lantibiotic, nukacin ISK-1, of Staphylococcus warneri ISK-1: cloning of the structural gene and identification of the structure Abstract: Staphylococcus warneri ISK-1, which we had previously reported as Pediococcus sp. ISK-1, produces a novel bacteriocin, nukacin ISK-1. Edman degradation of the chemically reduced nukacin ISK-1 produced a sequence of 27 amino acids, 7 of which were unidentified. Using single-specific-primer-PCR product as a probe, a 3.6-kb HindIII fragment containing the nukacin ISK-1 structural gene (nukA) was cloned and sequenced. The deduced amino acid sequence of nukacin ISK-1 had 57 amino acids, including a 30-amino acid leader region. The propeptide sequence showed significant similarity to those of lacticin-481 type lantibiotics. In the region upstream of nukA, a part of a long open reading frame (ORF), designated as nukM, encoding a putative modification enzyme was oriented in the opposite direction. In the region downstream of nukA, ORF1 was found in which the sequence of the putative translational product was similar to various response regulatory proteins.	1
Title: High specificity, electrochemical sandwich assays based on single aptamer sequences and suitable for the direct detection of small-molecule targets in blood and other complex matrices Abstract: We herein demonstrate a sandwich assay based on single aptamer sequences is suitable for the direct detection of small molecule targets in blood serum and other complex matrices. By splitting an aptamer into two pieces, we convert a single affinity reagent into a two-component system in which the presence of the target drives formation of a complex comprised of the target and the two halves of the aptamer. To demonstrate the utility of this approach we have used single anticocaine and anti-ATP aptamers to fabricate electrochemical sensors directed against the representative small molecules cocaine and ATP. Both targets are detected at low micromolar concentrations, in seconds, and in a convenient, general, readily reusable, electrochemical format. Moreover, both sensors are selective enough to deploy directly in blood, crude cellular lysates and other complex sample matrices.	0
Title: A Natural Variation of Fumonisin Gene Cluster Associated with Fumonisin Production Difference in Fusarium fujikuroi Abstract: Fusarium fujikuroi, a member of the Fusarium fujikuroi species complex, stands out as a rice bakanae disease pathogen with a high production of gibberellic acid. Not all, but some F. fujikuroi strains are known to produce a carcinogenic mycotoxin fumonisin. Fumonisin biosynthesis is dependent on the FUM cluster composed of 16 FUM genes. The FUM cluster was detected not only from a fumonisin producing strain, but also from a fumonisin nonproducing strain that does not produce a detectable level of fumonisin. Genetic mapping indicated the causative mutation(s) of fumonisin nonproduction is present in the FUM cluster of the fumonisin nonproducing strain. Comparative analyses of FUM genes between the fumonisin producing and the nonproducing strains and gene complementation indicated that causative mutation of fumonisin nonproduction is not a single occurrence and the mutations are distributed in FUM21 and FUM7. Our research revealed a natural variation in the FUM cluster involving fumonisin production difference in F. fujikuroi.	1
Title: Homolactate fermentation by metabolically engineered Escherichia coli strains Abstract: We report the homofermentative production of lactate in Escherichia coli strains containing mutations in the aceEF, pfl, poxB, and pps genes, which encode the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, pyruvate formate lyase, pyruvate oxidase, and phosphoenolpyruvate synthase, respectively. The process uses a defined medium and two distinct fermentation phases: aerobic growth to an optical density of about 30, followed by nongrowth, anaerobic production. Strain YYC202 (aceEF pfl poxB pps) generated 90 g/liter lactate in 16 h during the anaerobic phase (with a yield of 0.95 g/g and a productivity of 5.6 g/liter . h). Ca(OH)(2) was found to be superior to NaOH for pH control, and interestingly, significant succinate also accumulated (over 7 g/liter) despite the use of N(2) for maintaining anaerobic conditions. Strain ALS961 (YYC202 ppc) prevented succinate accumulation, but growth was very poor. Strain ALS974 (YYC202 frdABCD) reduced succinate formation by 70% to less than 3 g/liter. (13)C nuclear magnetic resonance analysis using uniformly labeled acetate demonstrated that succinate formation by ALS974 was biochemically derived from acetate in the medium. The absence of uniformly labeled succinate, however, demonstrated that glyoxylate did not reenter the tricarboxylic acid cycle via oxaloacetate. By minimizing the residual acetate at the time that the production phase commenced, the process with ALS974 achieved 138 g/liter lactate (1.55 M, 97% of the carbon products), with a yield of 0.99 g/g and a productivity of 6.3 g/liter . h during the anaerobic phase.	0
Title: Peptide Backbone Composition and Protease Susceptibility: Impact of Modification Type, Position, and Tandem Substitution Abstract: The clinical utility of peptides is limited by their rapid degradation by endogenous proteases. Modification of the peptide backbone can generate functional analogues with enhanced proteolytic stability. Existing principles for the design of such oligomers have focused primarily on effective structural mimicry. A more robust strategy would incorporate a rational approach for engineering maximal proteolytic stability with minimal unnatural residue content. We report here the systematic comparison of the proteolytic resistance imparted by four backbone modifications commonly employed in the design of protease-stable analogues of peptides with complex folding patterns. The degree of protection was quantified as a function of modification type, position, and tandem substitution in the context of a long, unstructured host sequence and a canonical serine protease. These results promise to inform ongoing work to develop biostable mimics of increasingly complex peptides and proteins.	0
Title: Cytotoxic and antibacterial beilschmiedic acids from a Gabonese species of Beilschmiedia Abstract: High-throughput natural products chemistry methods have facilitated the isolation of eight new (1-8) and two known (9 and 10) beilschmiedic acid derivatives from the leaves of a Gabonese species of Beilschmiedia. Compounds 3-10 were isolated in microgram quantities, and the NMR data for structure elucidation and dereplication were acquired utilizing a Bruker BioSpin TCI 1.7 mm MicroCryoProbe. All of the compounds were screened for cytotoxic and antibacterial activity against NCI-H460 human lung cancer cells and a clinical isolate of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, respectively. This is the first report of cytotoxic activity for the endiandric/beilschmiedic acid class of compounds.	0
Title: The mcyF gene of the microcystin biosynthetic gene cluster from Microcystis aeruginosa encodes an aspartate racemase Abstract: Microcystins are hepatotoxic, non-ribosomal peptides produced by several genera of freshwater cyanobacteria. Among other enzymic activities, in particular those of peptide synthetases and polyketide synthases, microcystin biosynthesis requires racemases that provide D-aspartate and D-glutamate. Here, we report on the cloning, expression and characterization of an open reading frame, mcyF, that is part of the mcy gene cluster involved in microcystin biosynthesis in the Microcystis aeruginosa strain PCC 7806. Conserved amino acid sequence motifs suggest a function of the McyF protein as an aspartate racemase. Heterologous expression of mcyF in the unicellular cyanobacterium Synechocystis PCC 6803 yielded an active His(6)-tagged protein that was purified to homogeneity by Ni(2+)-nitriloacetate affinity chromatography. The purified recombinant protein racemized in a pyridoxal-5'-phosphate-independent manner L-aspartate, but not L-glutamate. Furthermore, we have identified a putative glutamate racemase gene that is located outside the mcy gene cluster in the M. aeruginosa PCC 7806 genome. Whereas homologues of this glutamate racemase gene are present in all the Microcystis strains examined, mcyF could only be detected in microcystin-producing strains.	1
Title: Palladium(0)-catalyzed Heck reaction/C-H activation/amination sequence with diaziridinone: a facile approach to indolines Abstract: Indolines are important moieties present in various biologically significant molecules and have attracted considerable attention in synthetic chemistry. This paper describes a Heck reaction/C-H activation/amination sequence for forming indolines using di-tert-butyldiaziridinone. The reaction process likely proceeds via a pallada(II)cycle, which is converted into an indoline by oxidative addition to the diaziridinone and two subsequent C-N bond formations.	0
Title: Genotypic characterization and prevalence of virulence factors among Canadian Escherichia coli O157:H7 strains Abstract: In this study, the association between genotypic and selected phenotypic characteristics was examined in a collection of Canadian Escherichia coli O157:H7 strains isolated from humans and cattle in the provinces of Alberta, Ontario, Saskatchewan, and Quebec. In a subset of 69 strains selected on the basis of specific phage types (PTs), a strong correlation between the lineage-specific polymorphism assay (LSPA6) genotype and PT was observed with all strains of PTs 4, 14, 21, 31, 33, and 87 belonging to the LSPA6 lineage I (LSPA6-LI) genotype, while those of PTs 23, 45, 67, and 74 belonged to LSPA6 lineage II (LSPA6-LII) genotypes. This correlation was maintained when additional strains of each PT were tested. E. coli O157:H7 strains with the LSPA6-LI genotype were much more common in the collection than were the LSPA6-LII or lineage I/II (LSPA6-LI/II)-related genotypes (82.6, 11.2, and 5.8%, respectively). Of the strains tested, proportionately more LSPA6-LI than LSPA6-LII genotype strains were isolated from humans (52.7% versus 19.7%) than from cattle (47.8% versus 80.2%). In addition, 96.7% of the LSPA6-LII strains carried the stx(2c) variant gene, while only 50.0% of LSPA6-LI/II and 2.7% of LSPA6-LI strains carried this gene. LSPA6-LII strains were also significantly more likely to possess the colicin D gene, cda (50.8% versus 23.2%), and have combined resistance to streptomycin, sulfisoxazole, and tetracycline (72.1% versus 0.9%) than were LSPA6-LI strains. The LSPA6 genotype- and PT-related characteristics identified may be important markers of specific ecotypes of E. coli O157:H7 that have unique epidemiological and virulence characteristics.	0
Title: Rubesanolides A and B: diterpenoids from Isodon rubescens Abstract: From the medicinal plant Isodon rubescens, we isolated two novel diterpenes, rubesanolides A (1) and B (2). The compounds contain a unique β-lactone subgroup. This is the first discovery for a natural diterpene having rings A, B, and C in chair, boat, and twist-chair conformations, respectively. The structures were elucidated by analysis of spectroscopic data, and the absolute configuration of 1 was determined by X-ray diffraction.	0
Title: The Arabidopsis O-fucosyltransferase SPINDLY activates nuclear growth repressor DELLA Abstract: Plant development requires coordination among complex signaling networks to enhance the plant's adaptation to changing environments. DELLAs, transcription regulators originally identified as repressors of phytohormone gibberellin signaling, play a central role in integrating multiple signaling activities via direct protein interactions with key transcription factors. Here, we found that DELLA is mono-O-fucosylated by the novel O-fucosyltransferase SPINDLY (SPY) in Arabidopsis thaliana. O-fucosylation activates DELLA by promoting its interaction with key regulators in brassinosteroid- and light-signaling pathways, including BRASSINAZOLE-RESISTANT1 (BZR1), PHYTOCHROME-INTERACTING-FACTOR3 (PIF3) and PIF4. Moreover, spy mutants displayed elevated responses to gibberellin and brassinosteroid, and increased expression of common target genes of DELLAs, BZR1 and PIFs. Our study revealed that SPY-dependent protein O-fucosylation plays a key role in regulating plant development. This finding may have broader importance because SPY orthologs are conserved in prokaryotes and eukaryotes, thus suggesting that intracellular O-fucosylation may regulate a wide range of biological processes in diverse organisms.	0
Title: Novel ultraviolet (UV) nonlinear optical (NLO) materials discovered by chemical substitution-oriented design Abstract: Exploring novel functional materials via chemical substitution-oriented design is an emerging strategy. The method can be expanded to the discovery of high performance ultraviolet (UV) nonlinear optical (NLO) solid state materials by a careful tuning of the substituted atoms. This minireview presents a brief introduction to chemical substitution-oriented design including single-site substitution, dual-site substitution, and multisite substitution. Several state-of-the-art UV NLO materials such as K3VO(O2)2CO3-type, KBe2BO3F2 (KBBF)-type, Ca5(PO4)3(OH)-type, and KTiOPO4 (KTP)-type phases successfully discovered by the chemical substitution method are discussed.	0
Title: Draft genome sequence of Streptomyces coelicoflavus ZG0656 reveals the putative biosynthetic gene cluster of acarviostatin family α-amylase inhibitors Abstract: Aims:                       The aims of this study are to obtain the draft genome sequence of Streptomyces coelicoflavus ZG0656, which produces novel acarviostatin family α-amylase inhibitors, and then to reveal the putative acarviostatin-related gene cluster and the biosynthetic pathway.                  Methods and results:                       The draft genome sequence of S. coelicoflavus ZG0656 was generated using a shotgun approach employing a combination of 454 and Solexa sequencing technologies. Genome analysis revealed a putative gene cluster for acarviostatin biosynthesis, termed sct-cluster. The cluster contains 13 acarviostatin synthetic genes, six transporter genes, four starch degrading or transglycosylation enzyme genes and two regulator genes. On the basis of bioinformatic analysis, we proposed a putative biosynthetic pathway of acarviostatins. The intracellular steps produce a structural core, acarviostatin I00-7-P, and the extracellular assemblies lead to diverse acarviostatin end products.                  Conclusions:                       The draft genome sequence of S. coelicoflavus ZG0656 revealed the putative biosynthetic gene cluster of acarviostatins and a putative pathway of acarviostatin production.                  Significance and impact of the study:                       To our knowledge, S. coelicoflavus ZG0656 is the first strain in this species for which a genome sequence has been reported. The analysis of sct-cluster provided important insights into the biosynthesis of acarviostatins. This work will be a platform for producing novel variants and yield improvement.	1
Title: Identification and occurrence of the hydroxamate siderophores aerobactin, putrebactin, avaroferrin and ochrobactin C as virulence factors from entomopathogenic bacteria Abstract: Effective iron acquisition and fine-tuned intracellular iron storage systems are the main prerequisites for a successful host invasion by a pathogen. Bacteria have developed several different strategies to sequester this essential element from their environment, one relies on the secretion of low molecular weight compounds with high affinity for ferric iron, the so-called siderophores. Here, we report hydroxamate siderophore structures produced by entomopathogenic bacteria of the species Xenorhabdus and Photorhabdus, which are known for their potential to produce bioactive natural products, required for their role as nematode symbiont and insect pathogen. Four siderophores could be identified, namely aerobactin, putrebactin, avaroferrin and ochrobactin C, which was found previously only in marine bacteria. While the putrebactin and avaroferrin producing biosynthesis gene cluster (BGC) is more widespread and most likely was present in a common ancestor of these bacteria, the aerobactin and ochrobactin producing BGC was probably taken up by a few strains individually. For aerobactin a role in virulence towards Galleria mellonella larvae is shown.	1
Title: Characterization of the 4-hydroxybenzoyl-coenzyme A thioesterase from Arthrobacter sp. strain SU Abstract: The Arthrobacter sp. strain SU 4-chlorobenzoate (4-CBA) dehalogenation pathway converts 4-CBA to 4-hydroxybenzoate (4-HBA). The pathway operon contains the genes fcbA, fcbB, and fcbC (A. Schmitz, K. H. Gartemann, J. Fiedler, E. Grund, and R. Eichenlaub, Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 58:4068-4071, 1992). Genes fcbA and fcbB encode 4-CBA-coenzyme A (CoA) ligase and 4-CBA-CoA dehalogenase, respectively, whereas the function of fcbC is not known. We subcloned fcbC and expressed it in Escherichia coli, and we purified and characterized the FcbC protein. A substrate activity screen identified benzoyl-CoA thioesters as the most active substrates. Catalysis of 4-HBA-CoA hydrolysis to 4-HBA and CoA occurred with a k(cat) of 6.7 s(-1) and a K(m) of 1.2 micro M. The k(cat) pH rate profile for 4-HBA-CoA hydrolysis indicated optimal activity over a pH range of 6 to 10. The amino acid sequence of the FcbC protein was compared to other sequences contained in the protein sequence data banks. A large number of sequence homologues of unknown function were identified. On the other hand, the 4-HBA-CoA thioesterases isolated from 4-CBA-degrading Pseudomonas strains did not share significant sequence identity with the FcbC protein, indicating early divergence of the thioesterase-encoding genes.	0
Title: Disruption of the Trichoderma reesei gul1 gene stimulates hyphal branching and reduces broth viscosity in cellulase production Abstract: Hyphal morphology is considered to have a close relationship with the production level of secreted proteins by filamentous fungi. In this study, the gul1 gene, which encodes a putative mRNA-binding protein, was disrupted in cellulase-producing fungus Trichoderma reesei. The hyphae of Δgul1 strain produced more lateral branches than the parent strain. Under the condition for cellulase production, disruption of gul1 resulted in smaller mycelial clumps and significantly lower viscosity of fermentation broth. In addition, cellulase production was improved by 22% relative to the parent strain. Transcriptome analysis revealed that a set of genes encoding cell wall remodeling enzymes as well as hydrophobins were differentially expressed in the Δgul1 strain. The results suggest that the regulatory role of gul1 in cell morphogenesis is likely conserved in filamentous fungi. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the engineering of gul1 in an industrially important fungus.	0
Title: The polyketide cyclase RemF from Streptomyces resistomycificus contains an unusual octahedral zinc binding site Abstract: RemF is a polyketide cyclase involved in the biosynthesis of the aromatic pentacyclic metabolite resistomycin in Streptomyces resistomycificus. The enzyme is a member of a structurally hitherto uncharacterized class of polyketide cyclases. The crystal structure of RemF was determined by SAD and refined to 1.2 A resolution. The enzyme subunit shows a beta-sandwich structure with a topology characteristic for the cupin fold. RemF contains a metal binding site located at the bottom of the predominantly hydrophobic active site cavity. A zinc ion is coordinated to four histidine side chains, and two water molecules in octahedral ligand sphere geometry, highly unusual for zinc binding sites in proteins.	1
Title: Gene cluster conferring streptomycin, sulfonamide, and tetracycline resistance in Escherichia coli O157:H7 phage types 23, 45, and 67 Abstract: Multidrug resistance to streptomycin, sulfonamide, and tetracycline (AMR-SSuT) was identified in 156 of 171 isolates of Escherichia coli O157:H7 of phage types 23, 45, and 67. In 154 AMR-SSuT isolates, resistance was encoded by strA, strB, sul2, and tet(B), which in 59 of 63 tested isolates were found clustered together on the chromosome within the cdiA locus.	0
Title: Single-bacterial genomics validates rich and varied specialized metabolism of uncultivated Entotheonella sponge symbionts Abstract: Marine sponges are prolific sources of unique bioactive natural products. The sponge Theonella swinhoei is represented by several distinct variants with largely nonoverlapping chemistry. For the Japanese chemotype Y harboring diverse complex polyketides and peptides, we previously provided genomic and functional evidence that a single symbiont, the filamentous, multicellular organism "Candidatus Entotheonella factor," produces almost all of these compounds. To obtain further insights into the chemistry of "Entotheonella," we investigated another phylotype, "Candidatus Entotheonella serta," present in the T. swinhoei WA sponge chemotype, a source of theonellamide- and misakinolide-type compounds. Unexpectedly, considering the lower chemical diversity, sequencing of individual bacterial filaments revealed an even larger number of biosynthetic gene regions than for Ca E. factor, with virtually no overlap. These included genes for misakinolide and theonellamide biosynthesis, the latter assigned by comparative genomic and metabolic analysis of a T. swinhoei chemotype from Israel, and by biochemical studies. The data suggest that both compound families, which were among the earliest model substances to study bacterial producers in sponges, originate from the same bacterium in T. swinhoei WA. They also add evidence that metabolic richness and variability could be a more general feature of Entotheonella symbionts.	1
Title: Catalytic Activation of Unstrained C(Aryl)-C(Alkyl) Bonds in 2,2'-Methylenediphenols Abstract: Catalytic activation of unstrained and nonpolar C-C bonds remains a largely unmet challenge. Here, we describe our detailed efforts in developing a rhodium-catalyzed hydrogenolysis of unstrained C(aryl)-C(alkyl) bonds in 2,2'-methylenediphenols aided by removable directing groups. Good yields of the monophenol products are obtained with tolerating a wide range of functional groups. In addition, the reaction is scalable, and the catalyst loading can be reduced to as low as 0.5 mol %. Moreover, this method proves to be effective to cleave C(aryl)-C(alkyl) linkages in both models of phenolic resins and commercial novolacs resins. Finally, detailed experimental and computational mechanistic studies show that with C-H activation being a competitive but reversible off-cycle reaction, this transformation goes through a directed C(aryl)-C(alkyl) oxidative addition pathway.	0
Title: Biocatalytic hydrogenation of the C=C bond in the enone unit of hydroxylated chalcones-process arising from cyanobacterial adaptations Abstract: To verify the hypothesis that cyanobacteria naturally biosynthesising polyphenolic compounds possess an active enzymatic system that enables them to transform these substances, such an ability of the biocatalytic systems of whole cells of these biota was assessed for the first time. One halophilic strain and seven freshwater strains of cyanobacteria representing four of the five taxonomic orders of Cyanophyta were examined to determine the following: (i) whether they contain polyphenols, including flavonoids; (ii) the resistance of their cultures when suppressed by the presence of exogenous hydroxychalcones-precursors of flavonoid biosynthesis and (iii) whether these photoautotrophs can transform hydroxylated chalcones. All examined strains were found to contain polyphenols and flavonoids, and the growth of their cultures was inhibited in the presence of 2'-hydroxychalcone, 2″-hydroxychalcone and 4″-hydroxychalcone. We also confirmed that the examined cyanobacteria transformed hydroxychalcones via hydrogenative bio-reduction and formed the corresponding hydroxydihydro derivatives with yields above 90% whenever the substrates were bioavailable for such a conversion. Moreover, we observed that the routes and efficiency of biohydrogenation (and hydroxylation) of chalcones were dependent on the location of the hydroxyl substituent. The final products obtained as the results of biotransformations were extracted from the media and identified by mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR, 13C NMR, COSY, HSQC). Based on those results, we believe that the very efficient biohydrogenation of hydroxychalcones, which may easy be scaled up for biotechnological purposes, reflects the natural activity of the cyanobacterial defence system, because hydroxydihydrochalcones were less active inhibitors of the growth of cyanobacterial cultures than the corresponding substrates.	0
Title: Mitochondrial Superoxide Dismutase and Yap1p Act as a Signaling Module Contributing to Ethanol Tolerance of the Yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae Abstract: There are two superoxide dismutases in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae-cytoplasmic and mitochondrial enzymes. Inactivation of the cytoplasmic enzyme, Sod1p, renders the cells sensitive to a variety of stresses, while inactivation of the mitochondrial isoform, Sod2p, typically has a weaker effect. One exception is ethanol-induced stress. Here we studied the role of Sod2p in ethanol tolerance of yeast. First, we found that repression of SOD2 prevents ethanol-induced relocalization of yeast hydrogen peroxide-sensing transcription factor Yap1p, one of the key stress resistance proteins. In agreement with this, the levels of Trx2p and Gsh1p, proteins encoded by Yap1 target genes, were decreased in the absence of Sod2p. Analysis of the ethanol sensitivities of the cells lacking Sod2p, Yap1p, or both indicated that the two proteins act in the same pathway. Moreover, preconditioning with hydrogen peroxide restored the ethanol resistance of yeast cells with repressed SOD2 Interestingly, we found that mitochondrion-to-nucleus signaling by Rtg proteins antagonizes Yap1p activation. Together, our data suggest that hydrogen peroxide produced by Sod2p activates Yap1p and thus plays a signaling role in ethanol tolerance.                  Importance:                       Baker's yeast harbors multiple systems that ensure tolerance to high concentrations of ethanol. Still, the role of mitochondria under severe ethanol stress in yeast is not completely clear. Our study revealed a signaling function of mitochondria which contributes significantly to the ethanol tolerance of yeast cells. We found that mitochondrial superoxide dismutase Sod2p and cytoplasmic hydrogen peroxide sensor Yap1p act together as a module of the mitochondrion-to-nucleus signaling pathway. We also report cross talk between this pathway and the conventional retrograde signaling cascade activated by dysfunctional mitochondria.	0
Title: Parsing a multifunctional biosynthetic gene cluster from rice: Biochemical characterization of CYP71Z6 & 7 Abstract: Rice (Oryza sativa) contains a biosynthetic gene cluster associated with production of at least two groups of diterpenoid phytoalexins, the antifungal phytocassanes and antibacterial oryzalides. While cytochromes P450 (CYP) from this cluster are known to be involved in phytocassane production, such mono-oxygenase activity relevant to oryzalide biosynthesis was unknown. Here we report biochemical characterization demonstrating that CYP71Z6 from this cluster acts as an ent-isokaurene C2-hydroxylase that is presumably involved in the biosynthesis of oryzalides. Our results further suggest that the closely related and co-clustered CYP71Z7 likely acts as a C2-hydroxylase involved in a latter step of phytocassane biosynthesis. Thus, CYP71Z6 & 7 appear to have evolved distinct roles in rice diterpenoid metabolism, offering insight into plant biosynthetic gene cluster evolution.	1
Title: A post-transcriptional mechanism contributes to circadian cycling of a per-beta-galactosidase fusion protein Abstract: The period gene (per) of Drosophila melanogaster affects circadian rhythms. Circadian fluctuations in per mRNA levels are thought to contribute to circadian fluctuations in per protein levels in the heads of adult flies. To address the mechanisms underlying these oscillatory phenomena, we have analyzed RNA and protein cycling from two per-beta-galactosidase fusion genes. These studies demonstrate that 5' noncoding sequences from per are sufficient to cause the fusion mRNA levels to cycle in a wild-type (rhythmic) background. Protein cycling requires additional sequences derived from the per coding region. The data suggest that there is a per-dependent posttranscriptional mechanism that is under circadian clock control required for per protein levels to fluctuate in a rhythmic fashion.	0
Title: Analysis of coiled-coil interactions between core proteins of the spindle pole body Abstract: The spindle pole body (SPB) is a multiprotein complex that organizes microtubules in yeast. Due to its large size and association with the nuclear membrane, little is known about its detailed structure. In particular, although many SPB components and some of the interactions between them have been identified, the molecular details of how most of these interactions occur are not known. The prevalence of predicted coiled-coil regions in SPB proteins suggests that some interactions may occur via coiled coils. Here this hypothesis is supported by biochemical characterization of isolated coiled-coil peptides derived from SPB proteins. Formation of four strongly self-associating coiled-coil complexes from Spc29, Spc42, and Spc72 was demonstrated by circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy and a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assay. Many weaker self- and heteroassociations were also detected by CD, FRET, and/or cross-linking. The thermal stabilities of nine candidate homooligomers were assessed; six unfolded cooperatively with melting temperatures ranging from <11 to >50 degrees C. Solution studies established that coiled-coil peptides derived from Spc42 and Spc72 form parallel dimers, and this was confirmed for Spc42 by a high-resolution crystal structure. These data contribute to a growing body of knowledge that will ultimately provide a detailed model of the SPB structure.	0
Title: The sirodesmin biosynthetic gene cluster of the plant pathogenic fungus Leptosphaeria maculans Abstract: Sirodesmin PL is a phytotoxin produced by the fungus Leptosphaeria maculans, which causes blackleg disease of canola (Brassica napus). This phytotoxin belongs to the epipolythiodioxopiperazine (ETP) class of toxins produced by fungi including mammalian and plant pathogens. We report the cloning of a cluster of genes with predicted roles in the biosynthesis of sirodesmin PL and show via gene disruption that one of these genes (encoding a two-module non-ribosomal peptide synthetase) is essential for sirodesmin PL biosynthesis. Of the nine genes in the cluster tested, all are co-regulated with the production of sirodesmin PL in culture. A similar cluster is present in the genome of the opportunistic human pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus and is most likely responsible for the production of gliotoxin, which is also an ETP. Homologues of the genes in the cluster were also identified in expressed sequence tags of the ETP producing fungus Chaetomium globosum. Two other fungi with publicly available genome sequences, Magnaporthe grisea and Fusarium graminearum, had similar gene clusters. A comparative analysis of all four clusters is presented. This is the first report of the genes responsible for the biosynthesis of an ETP.	1
Title: Structure and organization of plasmid genes required to produce the translation inhibitor microcin C7 Abstract: The translation inhibitor microcin C7 (MccC7) is a linear heptapeptide whose N terminus has been replaced by an N-formyl group and whose C terminus has been replaced by the phosphodiester of 5'-adenylic acid and n-aminopropanol (J. I. Guijarro, J. E. González-Pastor, F. Baleux, J. L. San Millán, M. A. Castilla, M. Rico, F. Moreno, and M. Delepierre, J. Biol. Chem. 270:23520-23532, 1995). MccC7 production and immunity determinants lie on a 6.2-kb region of the Escherichia coli plasmid pMccC7. This region was entirely sequenced. It contains six open reading frames, which were shown to be true genes by different complementary approaches. Five genes, mccABCDE, which are transcribed in the same direction, are required to produce mature extracellular microcin. The sixth gene, mccF, adjacent to mccE, is transcribed in the opposite direction and encodes specific self-immunity. Genes mccA to -E constitute an operon transcribed from a promoter (mccp) located upstream of mccA. mccA is 21 nucleotides long and encodes the unmodified heptapeptide (J. E. González-Pastor, J. L. San Millán, and F. Moreno, Nature [London] 369:281, 1994). A comparison of predicted gene polypeptide products with those included in databases shows that an 81-amino-acid stretch of MccB is strikingly homologous to fragments of the same length of proteins ThiF and ChlN from E. coli, HesA from Anabaena sp. strain PCC7120, and UBA1, the ubiquitin-activating enzyme from different eukaryotic species. MccC displays several hydrophobic domains, suggesting a transmembrane location. The carboxyl end of MccE displays 41.2% identity with RimL, a protein required to acetylate the ribosome protein L12 from E. coli. In the absence of the other mcc genes, mccA impairs the growth of host cells, suggesting that unmodified MccA has antibiotic activity. A model for MccC7 biosynthesis, export, and immunity is proposed.	1
Title: Polyketide decarboxylative chain termination preceded by o-sulfonation in curacin a biosynthesis Abstract: Biosynthetic innovation in natural product systems is driven by the recruitment of new genes and enzymes into these complex pathways. Here, an unprecedented decarboxylative chain termination mechanism is described for the polyketide synthase of curacin A, an anticancer lead compound isolated from the marine cyanobacterium Lyngbya majuscula. The unusual chain termination module containing adjacent sulfotransferase (ST) and thioesterase (TE) catalytic domains embedded in CurM was biochemically characterized. The TE was proved to catalyze a hydrolytic chain release of the polyketide chain elongation intermediate. Moreover, a selective ST-mediated sulfonation of the (R)-beta-hydroxyl group was found to precede TE-mediated hydrolysis, triggering a successive decarboxylative elimination and resulting in the formation of a rare terminal olefin in the final metabolite.	1
Title: The Small Molecule 2-Azido-2-deoxy-glucose Is a Metabolic Chemical Reporter of O-GlcNAc Modifications in Mammalian Cells, Revealing an Unexpected Promiscuity of O-GlcNAc Transferase Abstract: Glycans can be directly labeled using unnatural monosaccharide analogs, termed metabolic chemical reporters (MCRs). These compounds enable the secondary visualization and identification of glycoproteins by taking advantage of bioorthogonal reactions. Most widely used MCRs have azides or alkynes at the 2-N-acetyl position but are not selective for one class of glycoprotein over others. To address this limitation, we are exploring additional MCRs that have bioorthogonal functionality at other positions. Here, we report the characterization of 2-azido-2-deoxy-glucose (2AzGlc). We find that 2AzGlc selectively labels intracellular O-GlcNAc modifications, which further supports a somewhat unexpected, structural flexibility in this pathway. In contrast to the endogenous modification N-acetyl-glucosamine (GlcNAc), we find that 2AzGlc is not dynamically removed from protein substrates and that treatment with higher concentrations of per-acetylated 2AzGlc is toxic to cells. Finally, we demonstrate that this toxicity is an inherent property of the small-molecule, as removal of the 6-acetyl-group renders the corresponding reporter nontoxic but still results in protein labeling.	0
Title: Biosynthetic genes and activity spectrum of antifungal polyynes from Collimonas fungivorans Ter331 Abstract: The antifungal activity of bacteria from the genus Collimonas has been well documented, but the chemistry and gene functions that underlie this phenotype are still poorly understood. Screening of a random plasposon insertion library of Collimonas fungivorans Ter331 for loss-of-function mutants revealed the importance of gene cluster K, which is annotated to code for the biosynthesis of a secondary metabolite and which features genes for fatty acid desaturases and polyketide synthases. Mutants in gene cluster K had lost the ability to inhibit hyphal growth of the fungus Aspergillus niger and were no longer able to produce and secrete several metabolites that after extraction and partial purification from wildtype strain Ter331 were shown to share a putative ene-triyne moiety. Some but not all of these metabolites were able to inhibit growth of A. niger, indicating functional variation within this group of Collimonas-produced polyyne-like 'collimomycins'. Polymerase chain reaction analysis of isolates representing different Collimonas species indicated that the possession of cluster K genes correlated positively with antifungal ability, further strengthening the notion that this cluster is involved in collimomycin production. We discuss our findings in the context of other bacterially produced polyynes and the potential use of collimomycins for the control of harmful fungi.	1
Title: Suppression of DNA Polymerase β Activity Is Synthetically Lethal in BRCA1-Deficient Cells Abstract: People whose cells express mutated forms of the BRCA1 tumor suppressor are at a higher risk for developing cancer. BRCA1-deficient cells are defective in DNA double-strand break repair. The inhibition of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 in such cells is a synthetically lethal, cytotoxic effect that has been exploited to produce anticancer drugs such as Olaparib. However, alternative synthetic lethal approaches are necessary. We report that DNA polymerase β (Pol β) forms a synthetically lethal interaction with BRCA1. The SiRNA knockdown of Pol β or the treatment with a Pol β pro-inhibitor (pro-1) is cytotoxic in BRCA1-deficient ovarian cancer cells. BRCA1-complemented cells are significantly less susceptible to either treatment. pro-1 is also toxic to BRCA1-deficient breast cancer cells, and its toxicity in BRCA1-deficient cells is comparable to that of Olaparib. These experiments establish Pol β as a synthetically lethal target within BRCA1-deficient cells and a potentially useful one for treating cancer.	0
Title: Monoacylglycerols activate TRPV1--a link between phospholipase C and TRPV1 Abstract: Phospholipase C-mediated hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate generates diacylglycerol, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and protons, all of which can regulate TRPV1 activity via different mechanisms. Here we explored the possibility that the diacylglycerol metabolites 2-arachidonoylglycerol and 1-arachidonoylglycerol, and not metabolites of these monoacylglycerols, activate TRPV1 and contribute to this signaling cascade. 2-Arachidonoylglycerol and 1-arachidonoylglycerol activated native TRPV1 on vascular sensory nerve fibers and heterologously expressed TRPV1 in whole cells and inside-out membrane patches. The monoacylglycerol lipase inhibitors methylarachidonoyl-fluorophosphonate and JZL184 prevented the metabolism of deuterium-labeled 2-arachidonoylglycerol and deuterium-labeled 1-arachidonoylglycerol in arterial homogenates, and enhanced TRPV1-mediated vasodilator responses to both monoacylglycerols. In mesenteric arteries from TRPV1 knock-out mice, vasodilator responses to 2-arachidonoylglycerol were minor. Bradykinin and adenosine triphosphate, ligands of phospholipase C-coupled membrane receptors, increased the content of 2-arachidonoylglycerol in dorsal root ganglia. In HEK293 cells expressing the phospholipase C-coupled histamine H1 receptor, exposure to histamine stimulated the formation of 2-AG, and this effect was augmented in the presence of JZL184. These effects were prevented by the diacylglycerol lipase inhibitor tetrahydrolipstatin. Histamine induced large whole cell currents in HEK293 cells co-expressing TRPV1 and the histamine H1 receptor, and the TRPV1 antagonist capsazepine abolished these currents. JZL184 increased the histamine-induced currents and tetrahydrolipstatin prevented this effect. The calcineurin inhibitor ciclosporin and the endogenous "entourage" compound palmitoylethanolamide potentiated the vasodilator response to 2-arachidonoylglycerol, disclosing TRPV1 activation of this monoacylglycerol at nanomolar concentrations. Furthermore, intracerebroventricular injection of JZL184 produced TRPV1-dependent antinociception in the mouse formalin test. Our results show that intact 2-arachidonoylglycerol and 1-arachidonoylglycerol are endogenous TRPV1 activators, contributing to phospholipase C-dependent TRPV1 channel activation and TRPV1-mediated antinociceptive signaling in the brain.	0
Title: Performance and specificity of the covalently linked immunomagnetic separation-ATP method for rapid detection and enumeration of enterococci in coastal environments Abstract: The performance and specificity of the covalently linked immunomagnetic separation-ATP (Cov-IMS/ATP) method for the detection and enumeration of enterococci was evaluated in recreational waters. Cov-IMS/ATP performance was compared with standard methods: defined substrate technology (Enterolert; IDEXX Laboratories), membrane filtration (EPA Method 1600), and an Enterococcus-specific quantitative PCR (qPCR) assay (EPA Method A). We extend previous studies by (i) analyzing the stability of the relationship between the Cov-IMS/ATP method and culture-based methods at different field sites, (ii) evaluating specificity of the assay for seven ATCC Enterococcus species, (iii) identifying cross-reacting organisms binding the antibody-bead complexes with 16S rRNA gene sequencing and evaluating specificity of the assay to five nonenterococcus species, and (iv) conducting preliminary tests of preabsorption as a means of improving the assay. Cov-IMS/ATP was found to perform consistently and with strong agreement rates (based on exceedance/compliance with regulatory limits) of between 83% and 100% compared to the culture-based Enterolert method at a variety of sites with complex inputs. The Cov-IMS/ATP method is specific to five of seven different Enterococcus spp. tested. However, there is potential for nontarget bacteria to bind the antibody, which may be reduced by purification of the IgG serum with preabsorption at problematic sites. The findings of this study help to validate the Cov-IMS/ATP method, suggesting a predictable relationship between the Cov-IMS/ATP method and traditional culture-based methods, which will allow for more widespread application of this rapid and field-portable method for coastal water quality assessment.	0
Title: Self-resistance guided genome mining uncovers new topoisomerase inhibitors from myxobacteria Abstract: There is astounding discrepancy between the genome-inscribed production capacity and the set of known secondary metabolite classes from many microorganisms as detected under laboratory cultivation conditions. Genome-mining techniques are meant to fill this gap, but in order to favor discovery of structurally novel as well as bioactive compounds it is crucial to amend genomics-based strategies with selective filtering principles. In this study, we followed a self-resistance guided approach aiming at the discovery of inhibitors of topoisomerase, known as valid target in both cancer and antibiotic therapy. A common host self-defense mechanism against such inhibitors in bacteria is mediated by so-called pentapeptide repeat proteins (PRP). Genes encoding the biosynthetic machinery for production of an alleged topoisomerase inhibitor were found on the basis of their collocation adjacent to a predicted PRP in the genome of the myxobacterium Pyxidicoccus fallax An d48, but to date no matching compound has been reported from this bacterium. Activation of this peculiar polyketide synthase type-II gene cluster in the native host as well as its heterologous expression led to the structure elucidation of new natural products that were named pyxidicyclines and provided an insight into their biosynthesis. Subsequent topoisomerase inhibition assays showed strong affinity to - and inhibition of - unwinding topoisomerases such as E. coli topoisomerase IV and human topoisomerase I by pyxidicyclines as well as precise selectivity, since E. coli topoisomerase II (gyrase) was not inhibited at concentrations up to 50 μg ml-1.	1
Title: Characterization of the formation of the pyrrole moiety during clorobiocin and coumermycin A1 biosynthesis Abstract: The aminocoumarin antibiotics clorobiocin and coumermycin A(1) target the B subunit of DNA gyrase by presentation of the 5-methyl-pyrrolyl-2-carboxy ester moiety in the ATP-binding site of the enzyme. The pyrrolyl pharmacophore is derived by a four electron oxidation of a prolyl unit while tethered in phosphopantetheinyl thioester linkage to a peptidyl carrier protein (PCP) subunit. l-Proline is selected and activated as l-prolyl-AMP by adenylation domain enzymes (CloN4 and CouN4) and then installed as the thioester on the holo form of the PCP proteins CloN5 and CouN5. Enzymatic oxidation of the prolyl-S-PCP by the flavoprotein dehydrogenase CloN3 can be followed by rapid quench and subsequent electrospray ionization-Fourier transform mass spectrometry analysis of the acyl-S-protein substrate/product mixture to establish that a two-electron oxidized pyrrolinyl-S-enzyme transiently accumulates on the way to the four-electron oxidized, heteroaromatic pyrrolyl-2-carboxy-S-PCP acyl enzyme product.	1
Title: Simultaneous Identification of Neutral and Anionic Species in Complex Mixtures without Separation Abstract: A chemosensory system is reported that operates without the need for separation techniques and is capable of identifying anions and structurally similar bioactive molecules. In this strategy, the coordination of analytes to a metal complex with an open binding cleft generates "static structures" on the NMR timescale. Unique signals are created by strategically placing fluorine atoms in close proximity to bound analytes so that small structural differences induce distinct (19)F NMR shifts that can be used to identify each analyte. The utility of this method is illustrated by quantifying caffeine levels in coffee, by identifying ingredients in tea and energy drinks, and by discriminating between multiple biogenic amines with remote structural differences six carbon atoms away from the binding site. We further demonstrate the simultaneous identification of multiple neutral and anionic species in a complex mixture.	0
Title: Mussel protein adhesion depends on interprotein thiol-mediated redox modulation Abstract: Mussel adhesion is mediated by foot proteins (mfps) rich in a catecholic amino acid, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (dopa), capable of forming strong bidentate interactions with a variety of surfaces. A tendency toward facile auto-oxidation, however, often renders dopa unreliable for adhesion. We demonstrate that mussels limit dopa oxidation during adhesive plaque formation by imposing an acidic, reducing regime based on the thiol-rich mfp-6, which restores dopa by coupling the oxidation of thiols to dopaquinone reduction.	0
Title: Peplomycin sulfate and pulmonary fibrosis: hydroxyproline, uronic acid, proline hydroxylase and glucosamine 6-phosphate synthetase in lungs of hamsters treated with peplomycin Abstract: Effect of peplomycin sulfate (PLM) on pulmonary fibrosis was examined. Hydroxyproline, uronic acid, proline hydroxylase (EC 1.14.11.2) and glucosamine 6-phosphate synthetase (EC 2.6.1.16) in lungs of hamsters treated with PLM were studied and compared with those of hamsters treated with bleomycin (BLM). PLM, when administered intraperitoneally, one injection daily for 10 consecutive days, at either a high- (5 mg/kg) or low- (2.8 mg/kg) dosage-level, caused no significant increase of lung hydroxyproline and uronic acid as compared with controls. BLM on the other hand effected a significant increase in lung hydroxyproline on the high-dosage level (5 mg/kg) but not on the low-dosage level (2.8 mg/kg). In contrast, when administering PLM intratracheally, the concentrations of hydroxyproline in lungs increased 20% over the control levels. A transient increase of proline hydroxylase and glucosamine 6-phosphate synthetase also occurred shortly after the instillation. These increases were also observed in the corresponding groups treated with BLM, which confirmed the previous observations by other investigators. However, the magnitude of the increase was relatively lower in those values of PLM as compared with those of BLM. These data suggested that (1) PLM, when administered with multiple dosages intraperitoneally, showed no significant effect on the elevation of lung hydroxyproline; (2) PLM, when administered with a dose intratracheally, induced pulmonary fibrosis similar to that caused by BLM. However, the hydroxyproline accumulation in lungs of PLM-treated hamsters was less than in those of the BLM-treated; (3) The fibrotic effect on the lungs caused by either PLM or BLM was probably attributed to acceleration of the syntheses of collagen and acidic glycosaminoglycans.	0
Title: Biosynthesis of coumarin glycosides by transgenic hairy roots of Polygonum multiflorum Abstract: To investigate the substrate specificity and regio-selectivity of coumarin glycosyltransferases in transgenic hairy roots of Polygonum multiflorum, esculetin (1) and eight hydroxycoumarins (2-9) were employed as substrates. Nine corresponding glycosides (10-18) involving four new compounds, 6-chloro-4-methylcoumarin 7-O-β-D-glucopyranoside (15), 6-chloro-4-phenylcoumarin 7-O-β-D-glucopyranoside (16), 8-hydroxy-4-methylcoumarin 7-O-β-D-glucopyranoside (17), and 8-allyl-4-methylcoumarin 7-O-β-D-glucopyranoside (18), were biosynthesized by the hairy roots.	0
Title: Target-selected gene inactivation in Caenorhabditis elegans by using a frozen transposon insertion mutant bank Abstract: To understand how genotype determines the phenotype of the animal Caenorhabditis elegans, one ideally needs to know the complete sequence of the genome and the contribution of genes to phenotype, which requires an efficient strategy for reverse genetics. We here report that the Tc1 transposon induces frequent deletions of flanking DNA, apparently resulting from Tc1 excision followed by imprecise DNA repair. We use this to inactivate genes in two steps. (i) We established a frozen library of 5000 nematode lines mutagenized by Tc1 insertion, from which insertion mutants of genes of interest can be recovered. Their address within the library is determined by PCR. (ii) Animals are then screened, again by PCR, to detect derivatives in which Tc1 and 1000-2000 base pairs of flanking DNA are deleted, and thus a gene of interest is inactivated. We have thus far isolated Tc1 insertions in 16 different genes and obtained deletion derivatives of 6 of those.	0
Title: Engineering of New Pneumocandin Side-Chain Analogues from Glarea lozoyensis by Mutasynthesis and Evaluation of Their Antifungal Activity Abstract: Pneumocandins are lipohexapeptides of the echinocandin family that inhibit fungal 1,3-β-glucan synthase. Most of the pathway steps have been identified previously. However, the lipoinitiation reaction has not yet been experimentally verified. Herein, we investigate the lipoinitiation step of pneumocandin biosynthesis in Glarea lozoyensis and demonstrate that the gene product, GLligase, catalyzes this step. Disruption of GLHYD, a gene encoding a putative type II thioesterase and sitting upstream of the pneumocandin acyl side chain synthase gene, GLPKS4, revealed that GLHYD was necessary for optimal function of GLPKS4 and to attain normal levels of pneumocandin production. Double disruption of GLHYD and GLPKS4 did not affect residual function of the GLligase or GLNRPS4. Mutasynthesis experiments with a gene disruption mutant of GLPKS4 afforded us an opportunity to test the substrate specificity of GLligase in the absence of its native polyketide side chain to diversify pneumocandins with substituted side chains. Feeding alternative side chain precursors yielded acrophiarin and four new pneumocandin congeners with straight C14, C15, and C16 side chains. A comprehensive biological evaluation showed that one compound, pneumocandin I (5), has elevated antifungal activity and similar hemolytic activity compared to pneumocandin B0, the starting molecule for caspofungin. This study demonstrates that the lipoinitiation mechanism in pneumocandin biosynthesis involves interaction among a highly reducing PKS, a putative type II thioesterase, and an acyl AMP-ligase. A comparison of the SAR among pneumocandins with different-length acyl side chains demonstrated the potential for using GLligase for future engineering of new echinocandin analogues.	1
Title: Transcriptional analysis of the titin cap gene Abstract: Mutations in titin cap (Tcap), also known as telethonin, cause limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2G (LGMD2G). Tcap is one of the titin interacting Z-disc proteins involved in the regulation and development of normal sarcomeric structure. Given the essential role of Tcap in establishing and maintaining normal skeletal muscle architecture, we were interested in determining the regulatory elements required for expression of this gene in myoblasts. We have defined a highly conserved 421 bp promoter proximal promoter fragment that contains two E boxes and multiple putative Mef2 binding sequences. This promoter can be activated by MyoD and myogenin in NIH3T3 fibroblast cells, and maintains the differentiated cell-specific expression pattern of the endogenous Tcap in C2C12 cells. We find that while both E boxes are required for full activation by MyoD or myogenin in NIH3T3 cells, the promoter proximal E box has a greater contribution to activation of this promoter in C2C12 cells and to activation by MyoD in NIH3T3 cells. Together, the data suggest an important role for MyoD in activating Tcap expression through the promoter proximal E box. We also show that myogenin is required for normal expression in vivo and physically binds to the Tcap promoter during embryogenesis.	0
Title: Prostaglandin E2 biosynthesis by rabbit renomedullary interstitial cells in tissue culture. Mechanism of stimulation by angiotensin II, bradykinin, and arginine vasopressin Abstract: The mechanism of hormone-stimulated prostaglandin E2 biosynthesis was investigated in rabbit renomedullary interstitial cells in tissue culture. Angiotensin II, bradykinin, and arginine vasopressin stimulated arachidonic acid release and subsequent prostaglandin biosynthesis. Indomethacin completely inhibited prostaglandin biosynthesis without affecting arachidonic acid release. Mepacrine, a phospholipase inhibitor, inhibited arachidonic acid release without affecting subsequent synthesis of prostaglandin E2. Our studies suggest that arachidonic acid release via hormone-activated phospholipase or acylhydrolase (or both) is the mechanism of hormone-stimulated prostaglandin E2 biosynthesis.	0
Title: Determination of total protein content of bacterial cells by SYPRO staining and flow cytometry Abstract: An assay has been developed for measuring protein biomass of marine planktonic bacteria by flow cytometry. The method was calibrated by using five species of Bacteria (an Arcobacter sp., a Cytophaga sp., an Oceanospirillum sp., a Pseudoalteromonas sp., and a Vibrio sp.) recently isolated from seawater samples and grown in culture at different temperatures. The intensity of SYPRO-protein fluorescence of these bacteria strongly correlated with their total protein content, measured by the bicinchoninic acid method to be in the range of 60 to 330 fg of protein cell-1 (r2 = 0.93, n = 34). According to the calibration, the mean biomass of planktonic bacteria from the North Sea in August 1998 was 24 fg of protein cell-1.	0
Title: Chromosome replication in Myxococcus xanthus Abstract: The rates of DNA synthesis during the cell-division cycle were measured in Myxococcus xanthus growing in three different media permitting a twofold variation in doubling time. In all three media, simple DNA cycles were observed. Synthesis of DNA occurred during 85% of the cell-division cycle, independent of generation time, from 5 to 11 h. Cells were observed to contain one bacterial nucleoid at birth that later divided synchronously midway through the cell cycle. Nucleoid segregation appeared to begin before chromosome replication was completed. The DNA content of exponential-phase bacteria was determined to be about 20 +/- 3 X 10(-9) microgram per cell; newborn bacteria contained about 14 +/- 2 X 10(-9) microgram of DNA per cell. Exponential-phase bacteria showed about a 50% increase in DNA in the presence of chloramphenicol (50 microgram/ml). The number of randomly segregating chromosomes present in exponential-phase bacteria was determined by following the fate of prelabeled DNA during outgrowth in nonradioactive media. The results are consistent with a model in which cells are born with exactly one complete unreplicated chromosome. The molecular weight of such a chromosome is about 8.4 +/- 1.2 X 10(9).	0
Title: Discovery and characterization of the tubercidin biosynthetic pathway from Streptomyces tubercidicus NBRC 13090 Abstract: Background:                       Tubercidin (TBN), an adenosine analog with potent antimycobacteria and antitumor bioactivities, highlights an intriguing structure, in which a 7-deazapurine core is linked to the ribose moiety by an N-glycosidic bond. However, the molecular logic underlying the biosynthesis of this antibiotic has remained poorly understood.                  Results:                       Here, we report the discovery and characterization of the TBN biosynthetic pathway from Streptomyces tubercidicus NBRC 13090 via reconstitution of its production in a heterologous host. We demonstrated that TubE specifically utilizes phosphoribosylpyrophosphate and 7-carboxy-7-deazaguanine for the precise construction of the deazapurine nucleoside scaffold. Moreover, we provided biochemical evidence that TubD functions as an NADPH-dependent reductase, catalyzing irreversible reductive deamination. Finally, we verified that TubG acts as a Nudix hydrolase, preferring Co2+ for the maintenance of maximal activity, and is responsible for the tailoring hydrolysis step leading to TBN.                  Conclusions:                       These findings lay a foundation for the rational generation of TBN analogs through synthetic biology strategy, and also open the way for the target-directed search of TBN-related antibiotics.	1
Title: Research progress on Toll-like receptor signal transduction and its roles in antimicrobial immune responses Abstract: When microorganisms invade a host, the innate immune system first recognizes the pathogen-associated molecular patterns of these microorganisms through pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are known transmembrane PRRs existing in both invertebrates and vertebrates. Upon ligand recognition, TLRs initiate a cascade of signaling events; promote the pro-inflammatory cytokine, type I interferon, and chemokine expression; and play an essential role in the modulation of the host's innate and adaptive immunity. Therefore, it is of great significance to improve our understanding of antimicrobial immune responses by studying the role of TLRs and their signal molecules in the host's defense against invading microbes. This paper aims to summarize the specificity of TLRs in recognition of conserved microbial components, such as lipoprotein, lipopolysaccharide, flagella, endosomal nucleic acids, and other bioactive metabolites derived from microbes. This set of interactions helps to elucidate the immunomodulatory effect of TLRs and the signal transduction changes involved in the infectious process and provide a novel therapeutic strategy to combat microbial infections.	0
Title: Synthesis and evaluation of monophosphoryl lipid A derivatives as fully synthetic self-adjuvanting glycoconjugate cancer vaccine carriers Abstract: A fully synthetic carbohydrate-based cancer vaccine is an attractive concept, but an important topic in the area is to develop proper vaccine carriers that can improve the immunogenicity and other immunological properties of tumor-associated carbohydrate antigens (TACAs). In this context, four monophosphoryl derivatives of Neisseria meningitidis lipid A were synthesized via a highly convergent and effective strategy and evaluated as vaccine carriers and adjuvants. The conjugates of these monophosphoryl lipid A (MPLA) derivatives with a modified form of the sTn antigen were found to elicit high titers of antigen-specific IgG antibodies, indicating a T cell-dependent immune response, in the absence of an external adjuvant. It was concluded that MPLAs could be utilized as potent vaccine carriers and built-in adjuvants to create fully synthetic self-adjuvanting carbohydrate-based cancer vaccines. The lipid composition and structure of MPLA were shown to have a significant influence on its immunological activity, and among the MPLAs examined, natural N. meningitidis MPLA exhibited the most promising properties. Moreover, Titermax Gold, a conventional vaccine adjuvant, was shown to inhibit, rather than promote, the immunological activity of MPLA conjugates, maybe via interacting with MPLA.	0
Title: Interaction of influenza A virus M1 matrix protein with caspases Abstract: In this investigation, an ability of influenza A virus M1 matrix protein to bind intracellular caspases, the key enzymes of cell apoptosis, has been examined. Protein-protein binding on polystyrene plates and polyvinyl pyrrolidone membrane was employed for this purpose. Under a comparative study of caspases-3, -6, -7, -8 influenza virus M1 protein specifically bound caspase-8 and weakly bound caspase-7. Using a computer analysis of the N-terminal region of M1 protein, a site similar to the anti-caspase site of baculovirus p35 protein, which inhibits caspases and displays antiapoptotic activity, was identified. These results are in good agreement with the supposition that influenza virus M1 protein is involved in a caspase-8-mediated apoptosis pathway in influenza virus infected cells.	0
Title: Temporal dynamics of natural product biosynthesis in marine cyanobacteria Abstract: Sessile marine organisms are prolific sources of biologically active natural products. However, these compounds are often found in highly variable amounts, with the abiotic and biotic factors governing their production remaining poorly understood. We present an approach that permits monitoring of in vivo natural product production and turnover using mass spectrometry and stable isotope ((15)N) feeding with small cultures of various marine strains of the natural product-rich cyanobacterial genus Lyngbya. This temporal comparison of the amount of in vivo (15)N labeling of nitrogen-containing metabolites represents a direct way to discover and evaluate factors influencing natural product biosynthesis, as well as the timing of specific steps in metabolite assembly, and is a strong complement to more traditional in vitro studies. Relative quantification of (15)N labeling allowed the concurrent measurement of turnover rates of multiple natural products from small amounts of biomass. This technique also afforded the production of the neurotoxic jamaicamides to be more carefully studied, including an assessment of how jamaicamide turnover compares with filament growth rate and primary metabolism and provided new insights into the biosynthetic timing of jamaicamide A bromination. This approach should be valuable in determining how environmental factors affect secondary metabolite production, ultimately yielding insight into the energetic balance among growth, primary production, and secondary metabolism, and thus aid in the development of methods to improve compound yields for biomedical or biotechnological applications.	1
Title: Bi- and Tetracyclic Spirotetronates from the Coal Mine Fire Isolate Streptomyces sp. LC-6-2 Abstract: The structures of 12 new "enantiomeric"-like abyssomicin metabolites (abyssomicins M-X) from Streptomyces sp. LC-6-2 are reported. Of this set, the abyssomicin W (11) contains an unprecedented 8/6/6/6 tetracyclic core, while the bicyclic abyssomicin X (12) represents the first reported naturally occurring linear spirotetronate. Metabolite structures were determined based on spectroscopic data and X-ray crystallography, and Streptomyces sp. LC-6-2 genome sequencing also revealed the corresponding putative biosynthetic gene cluster.	1
Title: BlmIII and BlmIV nonribosomal peptide synthetase-catalyzed biosynthesis of the bleomycin bithiazole moiety involving both in cis and in trans aminoacylation Abstract: Cloning and sequence analysis of the bleomycin (BLM) biosynthetic gene cluster predicted that the two nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs), BlmIV and BlmIII, are responsible for the biosynthesis of the BLM bithiazole moiety. BlmIV is a seven domain (C(2)-A(2)-PCP(2)-Cy(1)-A(1)-PCP(1)-Cy(0)) NRPS, and BlmIII is a three domain (A(0)-PCP(0)-Ox) NRPS. The three domains of Cy(1)-A(1)-PCP(1) residing on the BlmIV subunit, the four domains of Cy(0) residing on the BlmIV subunit, and A(0)-PCP(0)-Ox residing on the BlmIII subunit constitute the two thiazole-forming NRPS-1 and NRPS-0 modules, respectively. BlmIII-A(0) was predicted to be nonfunctional, raising the question of how the NRPS-0 module activates and loads the Cys substrate to its cognate BlmIII-PCP(0). The NRPS-0 module consists of domains residing on two different subunits, requiring precise protein-protein interaction. Here, we report the production of the BlmIV and BlmIII NRPSs as an excised domain(s), module, or intact subunit form and biochemical characterizations of the resultant enzymes in vitro for their roles in BLM bithiazole biosynthesis. Our results (a) confirm that BlmIII-A(0) is a naturally occurring nonfunctional mutant, (b) demonstrate that BlmIV-A(1) activates Cys and catalyzes both in cis aminoacylation of BlmIV-PCP(1) (for NRPS-1) and in trans aminoacylation of BlmIII-PCP(0) (for NRPS-0), and (c) reveal that the C-terminus of the BlmIV subunit, characterized by the unprecedented AGHDDD(G) and PGHDDG repeats, is absolutely required for in trans aminoacylation of BlmIII-PCP(0). These findings underscore the flexibility and versatility of NRPSs in both structure and mechanism for natural product biosynthesis and provide an outstanding opportunity to study the molecular recognition and protein-protein interaction mechanism in NRPS assembly line enzymology.	1
Title: Cooperative Involvement of Glycosyltransferases in the Transfer of Amino Sugars during the Biosynthesis of the Macrolactam Sipanmycin by Streptomyces sp. Strain CS149 Abstract: Macrolactams comprise a family of natural compounds with important bioactivities, such as antibiotic, antifungal, and antiproliferative activities. Sipanmycins A and B are two novel members of this family, with two sugar moieties attached to the aglycon. In the related macrolactam vicenistatin, the sugar moiety has been proven to be essential for cytotoxicity. In this work, the gene cluster responsible for the biosynthesis of sipanmycins (sip cluster) in Streptomyces sp. strain CS149 is described and the steps involved in the glycosylation of the final compounds unraveled. Also, the cooperation of two different glycosyltransferases in each glycosylation step is demonstrated. Additionally, the essential role of SipO2 as an auxiliary protein in the incorporation of the second deoxy sugar is addressed. In light of the results obtained by the generation of mutant strains and in silico characterization of the sip cluster, a biosynthetic pathway for sipanmycins and the two deoxy sugars attached is proposed. Finally, the importance of the hydroxyl group at C-10 of the macrolactam ring and the sugar moieties for cytotoxicity and antibiotic activity of sipanmycins is shown.IMPORTANCE The rapid emergence of infectious diseases and multiresistant pathogens has increased the necessity for new bioactive compounds; thus, novel strategies have to be developed to find them. Actinomycetes isolated in symbiosis with insects have attracted attention in recent years as producers of metabolites with important bioactivities. Sipanmycins are glycosylated macrolactams produced by Streptomyces sp. CS149, isolated from leaf-cutting ants, and show potent cytotoxic activity. Here, we characterize the sip cluster and propose a biosynthetic pathway for sipanmycins. As far as we know, it is the first time that the cooperation between two different glycosyltransferases is demonstrated to be strictly necessary for the incorporation of the same sugar. Also, a third protein with homology to P450 monooxygenases, SipO2, is shown to be essential in the second glycosylation step, forming a complex with the glycosyltransferase pair SipS9-SipS14.	1
Title: Unique post-translational oxime formation in the biosynthesis of the azolemycin complex of novel ribosomal peptides from Streptomyces sp. FXJ1.264 Abstract: Streptomycetes are a rich source of bioactive specialized metabolites, including several examples of the rapidly growing class of ribosomally-biosynthesized and post-translationally-modified peptide (RiPP) natural products. Here we report the discovery from Streptomyces sp. FXJ1.264 of azolemycins A-D, a complex of novel linear azole-containing peptides incorporating a unique oxime functional group. Bioinformatics analysis of the Streptomyces sp. FXJ1.264 draft genome sequence identified a cluster of genes that was hypothesized to be responsible for elaboration of the azolemycins from a ribosomally-biosynthesized precursor. Inactivation of genes within this cluster abolished azolemycin production, consistent with this hypothesis. Moreover, mutants lacking the azmE and azmF genes accumulated azolemycin derivatives lacking the O-methyl groups and an amino group in place of the N-terminal oxime (as well as proteolysed derivatives), respectively. Thus AzmE, a putative S-adenosyl methionine-dependent methyl transferase, is responsible for late-stage O-methylation reactions in azolemycin biosynthesis and AzmF, a putative flavin-dependent monooxygenase, catalyzes oxidation of the N-terminal amino group in an azolemycin precursor to the corresponding oxime. To the best of our knowledge, oxime formation is a hitherto unknown posttranslational modification in RiPP biosynthesis.	1
Title: Two glucosyltransferases are involved in detoxification of benzoxazinoids in maize Abstract: Benzoxazinoids are major compounds involved in chemical defence in grasses. These toxins are stored in the vacuole as glucosides. Two glucosyltransferases, BX8 and BX9, that catalyse this last step of benzoxazinoid biosynthesis have been isolated via functional cloning. No close relative of these maize genes was found among the known glucosyltransferases. The enzymes display a very high degree of substrate specificity. DIMBOA, the major benzoxazinoid in young maize, is the preferred substrate. Both genes are highly expressed in young maize seedlings, the developmental stage with the highest activity of benzoxazinoid biosynthesis. Bx8 is included in the cluster of DIMBOA biosynthesis genes located on the short arm of chromosome 4. Hence, the gene cluster comprises three different enzymatic functions and a complete set of genes for the biosynthesis of DIBOA glucoside. Bx9 mapped to chromosome 1. Expression of Bx8 and Bx9 in Arabidopsis corroborated the potency of the enzymes in detoxification of their substrates. This capacity might have implications for allelopathic interactions.	1
Title: Normalized Neural Representations of Complex Odors Abstract: The olfactory system removes correlations in natural odors using a network of inhibitory neurons in the olfactory bulb. It has been proposed that this network integrates the response from all olfactory receptors and inhibits them equally. However, how such global inhibition influences the neural representations of odors is unclear. Here, we study a simple statistical model of the processing in the olfactory bulb, which leads to concentration-invariant, sparse representations of the odor composition. We show that the inhibition strength can be tuned to obtain sparse representations that are still useful to discriminate odors that vary in relative concentration, size, and composition. The model reveals two generic consequences of global inhibition: (i) odors with many molecular species are more difficult to discriminate and (ii) receptor arrays with heterogeneous sensitivities perform badly. Comparing these predictions to experiments will help us to understand the role of global inhibition in shaping normalized odor representations in the olfactory bulb.	0
Title: Molecular evolution of the GDP-mannose pathway genes (manB and manC) in Salmonella enterica Abstract: The evolutionary history of the GDP-mannose pathway in Salmonella enterica was studied via sequencing manB and manC genes from 13 representative strains for O antigens containing mannose and/or sugar derivatives of GDP-D-mannose. In addition, colanic acid (CA) manB and manC genes were sequenced from selected strains, as the basis for a detailed comparison. Interestingly, including the eight previously characterized O antigen gene clusters, 12 of the 21 S. enterica strains studied in total (each representing a different O antigen structure) possess a manB gene which displays DNA identity, ranging from 93 to 99%, to the CA manB gene of S. enterica LT2. Furthermore, the CA-like manB genes (as well as the CA manB and manC genes) display subspecies specificity, and the CA and CA-like manB genes (for individual strains) appear to be evolving in concert via gene conversion events. In comparison, the manC genes were generally not CA-like, a situation also apparent in Escherichia coli,and therefore most strongly reflected the evolutionary history of the S. enterica O antigen GDP-mannose pathway. It appears that, in relatively recent times, gene capture from a distant source has occurred infrequently, and that groups of manB and manC genes have been maintained and are continuing to evolve within S. enterica and more closely related species.	1
Title: Dynamical Study of Adsorbate-Induced Restructuring Kinetics in Bimetallic Catalysts Using the PdAu(111) Model System Abstract: Dynamic restructuring of bimetallic catalysts plays a crucial role in their catalytic activity and selectivity. In particular, catalyst pretreatment with species such as carbon monoxide and oxygen has been shown to be an effective strategy for tuning the surface composition and morphology. Mechanistic and kinetic understanding of such restructuring is fundamental to the chemistry and engineering of surface active sites but has remained challenging due to the large structural, chemical, and temporal degrees of freedom. Here, we combine time-resolved temperature-programmed infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy, ab initio thermodynamics, and machine-learning molecular dynamics to uncover previously unidentified timescale and kinetic parameters of in situ restructuring in Pd/Au(111), a highly relevant model system for dilute Pd-in-Au nanoparticle catalysts. The key innovation lies in utilizing CO not only as a chemically sensitive probe of surface Pd but also as an agent that induces restructuring of the surface. Upon annealing in vacuum, as-deposited Pd islands became encapsulated by Au and partially dissolved into the subsurface, leaving behind isolated Pd monomers on the surface. Subsequent exposure to 0.1 mbar CO enabled Pd monomers to repopulate the surface up to 373 K, above which complete Pd dissolution occurred by 473 K, with apparent activation energies of 0.14 and 0.48 eV, respectively. These restructuring processes occurred over the span of ∼1000 s at a given temperature. Such a minute-timescale dynamics not only elucidates the fluxional nature of alloy catalysts but also presents an opportunity to fine-tune the surface under moderate temperature and pressure conditions.	0
Title: Analysis of a C-methyltransferase gene (aviG1) involved in avilamycin biosynthesis in Streptomyces viridochromogenes Tü57 and complementation of a Saccharopolyspora erythraea eryBIII mutant by aviG1 Abstract: Streptomyces viridochromogenes Tü57 is the principal producer of avilamycin A. aviG1, a putative methyltransferase gene, was detected in the avilamycin biosynthetic gene cluster. To determine the function of aviG1, a targeted gene inactivation experiment was performed. The resulting chromosomal mutant, carrying an in-frame deletion in aviG1, was deficient in avilamycin production. aviG1 was used to complement an eryBIII mutant of the erythromycin A producer Saccharopolyspora erythraea [Gaisser, S., Bohm, G. A., Doumith, M., Raynal, M. C., Dhillon, N., Cortes, J. & Leadlay, P. F. (1998). Mol Gen Genet 258, 78-88]. The presence of erythromycin A in the culture supernatant of the complemented mutant indicated that L-mycarose biosynthesis could be restored and that AviG1 could take over the function of the C-methyltransferase EryBIII.	1
Title: Identification of Cyclic Depsipeptides and Their Dedicated Synthetase from Hapsidospora irregularis Abstract: Seven cyclic depsipeptides were isolated from Hapsidospora irregularis and structurally characterized as the calcium channel blocker leualacin and six new analogues based on the NMR and HRESIMS data. These new compounds were named leualacins B-G. The absolute configurations of the amino acids and 2-hydroxyisocaproic acids were determined by recording the optical rotation values. Biological studies showed that calcium influx elicited by leualacin F in primary human lobar bronchial epithelial cells involves the TRPA1 channel. Through genome sequencing and targeted gene disruption, a noniterative nonribosomal peptide synthetase was found to be involved in the biosynthesis of leualacin. A comparison of the structures of leualacin and its analogues indicated that the A2 and A4 domains of the leualacin synthetase are substrate specific, while A1, A3, and A5 can accept alternative precursors to yield new molecules.	0
Title: Structure and biosynthesis of fumosorinone, a new protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B inhibitor firstly isolated from the entomogenous fungus Isaria fumosorosea Abstract: Fumosorinone, isolated from the entomogenous fungus Isaria fumosorosea, is a new 2-pyridone alkaloid which is elucidated by HRESIMS 1D and 2DNMR. Fumosorinone is structurally similar to tenellin and desmethylbassianin but it differs in chain length and degree of methylation. It is characterized by a classic noncompetitive inhibitor of protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (IC50 14.04μM) which was implicated as a negative regulator of insulin receptor signaling and a potential drug target for the treatment of type II diabetes and other associated metabolic syndromes. For further study, we identified the biosynthetic gene cluster of fumosorinone from ongoing genome sequencing project, and it was verified by a direct knock-out strategy, reported for the first time in I. fumosorosea, using the Agrobacterium-mediated transformation in conjunction with linear deletion cassettes. The biosynthetic gene cluster includes a hybrid polyketide synthase-nonribosomal peptide synthetase gene, two cytochrome P450 enzyme genes, a trans-enoyl reductase gene, and other two transcription regulatory genes. Comparison of fumosorinone biosynthetic cluster with known gene clusters gives further insight into biosynthesis of pyridone alkaloids and provides the foundation for combinatorial biosynthesis for new fumosorinone derivatives.	1
Title: Plasmodium falciparum Sir2A preferentially hydrolyzes medium and long chain fatty acyl lysine Abstract: Plasmodium falciparum Sir2A (PfSir2A), a member of the sirtuin family of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide-dependent deacetylases, has been shown to regulate the expression of surface antigens to evade the detection by host immune surveillance. It is thought that PfSir2A achieves this by deacetylating histones. However, the deacetylase activity of PfSir2A is weak. Here we present enzymology and structural evidence supporting that PfSir2A catalyzes the hydrolysis of medium and long chain fatty acyl groups from lysine residues more efficiently. Furthermore, P. falciparum proteins are found to contain such fatty acyl lysine modifications that can be removed by purified PfSir2A in vitro. Together, the data suggest that the physiological function of PfSir2A in antigen variation may be achieved by removing medium and long chain fatty acyl groups from protein lysine residues. The robust activity of PfSir2A would also facilitate the development of PfSir2A inhibitors, which may have therapeutic value in malaria treatment.	0
Title: Genetic Manipulation of an Aminotransferase Family Gene dtlA Activates Youssoufenes in Marine-Derived Streptomyces youssoufiensis Abstract: Disruption of an aminotransferase family gene dtlA activated the production of a novel dimeric benzoic polyene acids (BPAs), named youssoufene A1 (1), along with four new (2-5, youssoufenes B1-B4) and a known (6) monomeric BPA in the marine-derived Streptomyces youssoufiensis OUC6819. The structures of 1-5 were elucidated by extensive spectroscopic and computational approaches. Youssoufene A1 (1) exhibited notably increased growth inhibition (MIC = 12.5 μg/mL) against multidrug resistant Enterococcus faecalis compared to monomeric structures (2-6).	1
Title: Clavulanic acid biosynthesis and genetic manipulation for its overproduction Abstract: Clavulanic acid, a β-lactamase inhibitor, is used together with β-lactam antibiotics to create drug mixtures possessing potent antimicrobial activity. In view of the clinical and industrial importance of clavulanic acid, identification of the clavulanic acid biosynthetic pathway and the associated gene cluster(s) in the main producer species, Streptomyces clavuligerus, has been an intriguing research question. Clavulanic acid biosynthesis was revealed to involve an interesting mechanism common to all of the clavam metabolites produced by the organism, but different from that of other β-lactam compounds. Gene clusters involved in clavulanic acid biosynthesis in S. clavuligerus occupy large regions of nucleotide sequence in three loci of its genome. In this review, clavulanic acid biosynthesis and the associated gene clusters are discussed, and clavulanic acid improvement through genetic manipulation is explained.	1
Title: The opcA and (psi)opcB regions in Neisseria: genes, pseudogenes, deletions, insertion elements and DNA islands Abstract: Previous data have indicated that the opc gene encoding an immunogenic invasin is specific to Neisseria meningitidis (Nm) and is lacking in Neisseria gonorrhoeae (Ng). The data presented here show that Nm and Ng both contain two paralogous opc-like genes, opcA, corresponding to the former opc gene, and (psi)opcB, a pseudogene. The predicted OpcA and OpcB proteins possess transmembrane regions with conserved non-polar faces but differ extensively in four of the five surface-exposed loops. Gonococcal OpcA was expressed weakly under in vitro conditions, and it is unknown whether these bacteria can express this protein at high levels. Analysis of the sequences flanking opcA and (psi)opcB revealed a framework of conserved housekeeping genes interspersed with DNA islands. These regions also contained several pseudogenes, deletions and IS elements, attesting to considerable genome plasticity. Both opcA and (psi)opcB are located on DNA islands that have probably been imported from unrelated bacteria. A third island encodes the dcmD/dcrD R/M genes in Ng versus a small open reading frame in most strains of Nm. Rare strains of Nm were identified in which the R/M island has been imported. DNA islands in Nm and Ng seem to have been acquired by recombination via conserved flanking housekeeping genes rather than by insertion of mobile genetic elements.	0
Title: Molecular characterization of staphyloferrin B biosynthesis in Staphylococcus aureus Abstract: Siderophores are iron-scavenging molecules produced by many microbes. In general, they are synthesized using either non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) or NRPS-independent siderophore (NIS) pathways. Staphylococcus aureus produces siderophores, of which the structures of staphyloferrin A and staphyloferrin B are known. Recently, the NIS biosynthetic pathway for staphyloferrin A was characterized. Here we show that, in S. aureus, the previously identified sbn (siderophore biosynthesis) locus encodes enzymes required for the synthesis of staphyloferrin B, an alpha-hydroxycarboxylate siderophore comprised of l-2,3-diaminopropionic acid, citric acid, 1,2-diaminoethane and alpha-ketoglutaric acid. Staphyloferrin B NIS biosynthesis was recapitulated in vitro, using purified recombinant Sbn enzymes and the component substrates. In vitro synthesized staphyloferrin B readily promoted the growth of iron-starved S. aureus, via the ABC transporter SirABC. The SbnCEF synthetases and a decarboxylase, SbnH, were necessary and sufficient to produce staphyloferrin B in reactions containing component substrates l-2,3-diaminopropionic acid, citric acid and alpha-ketoglutaric acid. Since 1,2-diaminoethane was not required, this component of the siderophore arises from the SbnH-dependent decarboxylation of a 2,3-diaminoproprionic acid-containing intermediate. Liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS) analyses of a series of enzyme reactions identified mass ions corresponding to biosynthetic intermediates, allowing for the first proposed biosynthetic pathway for staphyloferrin B.	1
Title: Molecular genetics of naringenin biosynthesis, a typical plant secondary metabolite produced by Streptomyces clavuligerus Abstract: Background:                       Some types of flavonoid intermediates seemed to be restricted to plants. Naringenin is a typical plant metabolite, that has never been reported to be produced in prokariotes. Naringenin is formed by the action of a chalcone synthase using as starter 4-coumaroyl-CoA, which in dicotyledonous plants derives from phenylalanine by the action of a phenylalanine ammonia lyase.                  Results:                       A compound produced by Streptomyces clavuligerus has been identified by LC-MS and NMR as naringenin and coelutes in HPLC with a naringenin standard. Genome mining of S. clavuligerus revealed the presence of a gene for a chalcone synthase (ncs), side by side to a gene encoding a P450 cytochrome (ncyP) and separated from a gene encoding a Pal/Tal ammonia lyase (tal). Deletion of any of these genes results in naringenin non producer mutants. Complementation with the deleted gene restores naringenin production in the transformants. Furthermore, naringenin production increases in cultures supplemented with phenylalanine or tyrosine.                  Conclusion:                       This is the first time that naringenin is reported to be produced naturally in a prokariote. Interestingly three non-clustered genes are involved in naringenin production, which is unusual for secondary metabolites. A tentative pathway for naringenin biosynthesis has been proposed.	1
Title: Activation by 9-(R)-[2-(phosphonomethoxy)propyl]adenine of chemokine (RANTES, macrophage inflammatory protein 1alpha) and cytokine (tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin-10 [IL-10], IL-1beta) production Abstract: Development of a novel group of antiviral agents, acyclic nucleoside phosphonates, has provided a new perspective for treating human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. One of the compounds, 9-(R)-[2-(phosphonomethoxy)propyl]adenine (PMPA) (tenofovir), has been shown to confer complete protection against AIDS in a simian model of the infection. The aim of our study was to investigate whether the antiviral efficacy of PMPA, which depends mainly on inhibition of virus-induced DNA polymerase or of reverse transcriptase, could be contributed by immunomodulatory potential of this drug. We screened for its ability to activate production of cytokines and chemokines that are known to interfere with the replication and/or the entry of HIV in cells. Using the in vitro test system of mouse macrophages and lymphocytes, it has been found that PMPA stimulates macrophage secretion of interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), IL-10, and tumor necrosis factor alpha. Production of the chemokines RANTES and macrophage inflammatory protein 1alpha was activated in both macrophages and lymphocytes, and also in human cell line U937. Other cytokines--i.e., IL-2, IL-12, IL-13, and gamma interferon-remained uninfluenced by PMPA. The cytokines were stimulated in a dose-dependent fashion, with rapid onset, and peak concentrations were achieved within 5 to 24 h. The findings contribute to a more complex understanding of mechanisms of antiviral effectiveness of PMPA and support the view that this drug could become a promising candidate for therapeutic exploitation in anti-HIV preventive medicine.	0
Title: Distance-dependent translational coupling and interference in Lactococcus lactis Abstract: The possibility of raising the expression level of a heterologous gene in Lactococcus lactis by exploiting the principle of translational coupling was investigated. For this purpose, the Escherichia coli lacZ gene was transcriptionally fused to a short open reading frame (ORF) of lactococcal origin. A Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence was introduced at the boundary of the two ORFs. In a series of otherwise identical plasmids, the relative positions of the translational stop codon of the upstream ORF and the translational start codon of the downstream ORF (lacZ) were varied. The expression of lacZ gradually increased as the stop and start codons were placed in closer proximity. A concomitant switch from translational interference to translational coupling was observed. Best results were obtained with partially overlapping stop and start codons. It is concluded that the principle of translational coupling offers good possibilities to increase the level of heterologous gene expression in L. lactis.	0
Title: Gold-catalyzed diastereoselective cycloisomerization of alkylidene-cyclopropane-bearing 1,6-diynes Abstract: An unprecedented gold-catalyzed diastereoselective cycloisomerization of 1,6-diynes bearing an alkylidene cyclopropane moiety has been developed. This methodology enables rapid access to a variety of 1,2-trimethylenenorbornanes, which are important building blocks in the preparations of abiotic and sesquiterpene core structures.	0
Title: Division cycle of Myxococcus xanthus. 3. Kinetics of cell growth and protein synthesis Abstract: The kinetics of cell growth and protein synthesis during the division cycle of Myxococcus xanthus was determined. The distribution of cell size for both septated and nonseptated bacteria was obtained by direct measurement of the lengths of 8,000 cells. The Collins-Richmond equation was modified to consider bacterial growth in two phases: growth and division. From the derived equation, the growth rate of individual cells was computed as a function of size. Nondividing cells (growth phase) comprised 91% of the population and took up 87% of the time of the division cycle. The absolute and specific growth rates of nondividing cells were observed to increase continually throughout the growth phase; the growth rate of dividing cells could not be determined accurately by this technique because of changes in the geometry of cells between the time of septation and physical separation. The rate of protein synthesis during the division cycle was measured by pulselabeling an exponential-phase culture with radio-active valine or arginine and then preparing the cells for quantitative autoradiography. By measuring the size of individual cells as well as the number of grains, the rate of protein synthesis as a function of cell size was obtained. Nondividing cells showed an increase in both the absolute and specific rates of protein synthesis throughout the growth phase; the specific rate of protein synthesis for dividing cells was low when compared to growthphase cells. Cell growth and protein synthesis are compared to the previously reported kinetics of deoxyribonucleic acid and ribonucleic acid synthesis during the division cycle.	0
Title: Patulin transformation products and last intermediates in its biosynthetic pathway, E- and Z-ascladiol, are not toxic to human cells Abstract: Patulin is the main mycotoxin contaminating apples. During the brewing of alcoholic beverages, this mycotoxin is degraded to ascladiol, which is also the last precursor of patulin. The present study aims (1) to characterize the last step of the patulin biosynthetic pathway and (2) to describe the toxicity of ascladiol. A patE deletion mutant was generated in Penicillium expansum. In contrast to the wild strain, this mutant does not produce patulin but accumulates high levels of E-ascladiol with few traces of Z-ascladiol. This confirms that patE encodes the patulin synthase involved in the conversion of E-ascladiol to patulin. After purification, cytotoxicities of patulin and E- and Z-ascladiol were investigated on human cell lines from liver, kidney, intestine, and immune system. Patulin was cytotoxic for these four cell lines in a dose-dependent manner. By contrast, both E- and Z-ascladiol were devoid of cytotoxicity. Microarray analyses on human intestinal cells treated with patulin and E-ascladiol showed that the latter, unlike patulin, did not alter the whole human transcription. These results demonstrate that E- and Z-ascladiol are not toxic and therefore patulin detoxification strategies leading to the accumulation of ascladiol are good approaches to limit the patulin risk.	1
Title: Discovery of Cyanobacterial Natural Products Containing Fatty Acid Residues* Abstract: In recent years, extensive sequencing and annotation of bacterial genomes has revealed an unexpectedly large number of secondary metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters whose products are yet to be discovered. For example, cyanobacterial genomes contain a variety of gene clusters that likely incorporate fatty acid derived moieties, but for most cases we lack the knowledge and tools to effectively predict or detect the encoded natural products. Here, we exploit the apparent absence of a functional β-oxidation pathway in cyanobacteria to achieve efficient stable-isotope-labeling of their fatty acid derived lipidome. We show that supplementation of cyanobacterial cultures with deuterated fatty acids can be used to easily detect natural product signatures in individual strains. The utility of this strategy is demonstrated in two cultured cyanobacteria by uncovering analogues of the multidrug-resistance reverting hapalosin, and novel, cytotoxic, lactylate-nocuolin A hybrids-the nocuolactylates.	1
Title: Identification and Heterologous Expression of the Biosynthetic Gene Cluster Encoding the Lasso Peptide Humidimycin, a Caspofungin Activity Potentiator Abstract: Humidimycin (MDN-0010) is a ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptide (RiPP) belonging to class I lasso peptides, and is structurally related to siamycins, which have been shown to have strong antimicrobial activities against Gram-positive bacteria and to possess anti-HIV activity. Humidimycin was isolated from the strain Streptomyces humidus CA-100629, and was shown to synergize the activity of the fungal cell wall inhibitor caspofungin. In this work, the biosynthetic gene cluster of humidimycin was identified by genome mining of S. humidus CA-100629, cloned by Gibson assembly, and heterologously expressed.	1
Title: Discovery of Cryptic Largimycins in Streptomyces Reveals Novel Biosynthetic Avenues Enriching the Structural Diversity of the Leinamycin Family Abstract: Largimycins are hybrid nonribosomal peptide-polyketides that constitute a new group of metabolites in the leinamycin family of natural products displaying unique structural features such as containing an oxazole instead of a thiazole ring or being oxime ester macrocycles, unprecedented in nature, rather than macrolactams. Their discovery in Streptomyces argillaceus and Streptomyces canus has relied on the activation of two homologous silent gene clusters by overexpressing a transcriptional activator and cultivating in specific media. The proposed biosynthesis of largimycins includes the key action of the oxidoreductase LrgO, responsible for the formation of the oxime group involved in macrocyclization, and two putative cryptic biosynthetic steps consisting of chlorination of l-Thr by the NRPS loading module and incorporation of an olefinic exomethylene group by LrgJ PKS. The discovery of largimycins uncovers novel biosynthetic avenues employed in nature to enrich the structural diversity of leinamycins and provides tools for combinatorial biosynthesis.	1
Title: Formation and resealing of intercalator-induced DNA strand breaks in permeabilized L1210 cells without the stimulated synthesis of poly(ADP-ribose) Abstract: DNA strand breaks produced by damaging agents such as x-ray generally stimulate poly(adenosine diphosphoribose) (ADP-R) synthesis in mammalian cells. DNA intercalating agents induce the formation of strand breaks which are unusual in that they are associated with tightly or covalently bound protein. In order to determine whether the intercalator-induced strand breaks are associated with poly-(ADP-R) synthesis, L1210 cells were treated with the intercalating agent, 4'-(9-acridinylamino)methanesulfon-m-anisidide. Poly(ADP-R) synthesis, measured by [3H]NAD incorporation following cell permeabilization, was enhanced in x-irradiated cells, but not in cells exposed to 4'-(9-acridinylamino)methanesulfon-m-anisidide at doses which produced equivalent strand breaks frequencies. The permeabilized cell system did not support DNA synthesis and x-ray-induced strand breaks did not reseal. The intercalator-induced strand breaks, however, resealed within 10 min. Hence, the strand breaks observed in intercalator-treated cells may not constitute DNA damage in the usual sense. The resealing of intercalator-induced DNA breaks in the absence of DNA or poly(ADP-R) synthesis is unique among chemical or physical agents which produce DNA scissions.	0
Title: Genes involved in the regulation of beta-lactamase production in enterococci and staphylococci Abstract: In enterococci, the structural gene for beta-lactamase (blaZ) is identical to blaZ from Staphylococcus aureus. However, in the enterococci studied to date, beta-lactamase is produced constitutively, whereas in staphylococci it is often inducible. Recent reports have revealed the presence of two adjacent genes upstream of the staphylococcal blaZ thought to be the antirepressor (blaR1) and repressor (blaI) genes. In the present study, beta-lactamase expression mutants of the staphylococcal beta-lactamase plasmid pI524 were generated by transposon mutagenesis with the transposon Tn917. Tn917 insertions upstream of blaZ in either blaR1 or blaI resulted in constitutive beta-lactamase production, indicating that the repressor function is lost with insertion of Tn917 into either gene. This finding supports the concept that the staphylococcal beta-lactamase regulatory genes are encoded on a polycistronic mRNA. The corresponding region upstream of the enterococcal blaZ from Enterococcus faecalis HH22 was sequenced and compared with the staphylococcal blaR1 sequence. The two sequences were identical for 893 nucleotides, and then the sequences diverged completely. Therefore, in strain HH22, only 51% of the putative antirepressor gene is present and the repressor gene is also absent. In conclusion, constitutive beta-lactamase production in HH22 appears to be due to a lack of the regulatory genes blaR1 and blaI which regulate expression of blaZ in staphylococci.	0
Title: Analysis of the biosynthesis genes and chemical components of the capsule of Avibacterium paragallinarum Abstract: The aim of this study was to investigate biosynthesis genes and chemical components of the capsule of Avibacterium paragallinarum. The sequence of a 10-kb region containing the capsule biosynthetic locus of Av. paragallinarum was determined. Two reference strains, i.e., 221 (serovar A) and H18 (serovar C), together with four Taiwanese field strains (all serovar C) were sequenced. The results showed that there are two genotypes (I and II) of the capsule biosynthetic locus in Av. paragallinarum, and the capsule genotype is independent of the serovar. The capsule biosynthetic loci of genotypes I and II consisted of six and five genes, respectively. The genotype I genes encoded proteins that are most similar to proteins from Pasteurella multocida capsule types A and F while the genotype II genes encoded proteins most similar to proteins from P. multocida capsule type D and Escherichia coli K5. The results suggested that genotype I strains contain hyaluronan or chondroitin in the capsule wall while genotype II contain heparosan. Enzymatic digestion of the capsule materials extracted from Av. paragallinarum showed that genotype I strains contained chondroitin while genotype II strains contained heparosan in the capsule. This is the first report on the existence of different genotypes of capsule biosynthesis genes in Av. paragallinarum and the presence of chondroitin and heparosan as chemical components of the capsule of Av. paragallinarum.	1
Title: Aspergillin PZ, a novel isoindole-alkaloid from Aspergillus awamori Abstract: Aspergillin PZ was obtained from the fermentation of Aspergillus awamori (Nakazawa) by activity-guided fractionation and purification. Its structure was elucidated on the basis of spectral data, especially by 2D NMR, and finally confirmed by an X-ray analysis. It could induce conidia of P. oryzae to deform moderately.	0
Title: Genomic analyses lead to novel secondary metabolites. Part 3. ECO-0501, a novel antibacterial of a new class Abstract: Genomic analyses of Amycolatopsis orientalis ATCC 43491 strain, deposited as a vancomycin producer, revealed the presence of genetic loci for the production of at least 10 secondary metabolites other than vancomycin. One of these gene clusters, which contained a type I polyketide synthase, was predicted to direct the synthesis of novel class of compound, a glycosidic polyketide ECO-0501 (1). Screening of culture extracts for a compound with the predicted physicochemical properties of the product from this locus, led to the isolation of the 13-O-glucuronide of 13-hydroxy-2,12,14,16,22-pentamethyl-28-(N-methyl-guanidino)-octacosa-2,4,6,8,10,14,20,24-octaenoic acid (2-hydroxy-5-oxo-cyclopent-1-enyl)-amide (ECO-0501, 1). The structure, confirmed by spectral analyses including MS, and ID and 2D NMR experiments, were in accord with that predicted by genomic analyses. ECO-0501 possessed strong antibacterial activity against a series of Gram-positive pathogens including several strains of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant Enterococci (VRE). ECO-0501 was chemically modified by esterification (1a-1c), N-acetylation (1d) and hydrogenation (1e) in order to explore structure activity relationships (SAR).	1
Title: Characterization of staphyloferrin A biosynthetic and transport mutants in Staphylococcus aureus Abstract: Iron is critical for virtually all forms of life. The production of high-affinity iron chelators, siderophores, and the subsequent uptake of iron-siderophore complexes are a common strategy employed by microorganisms to acquire iron. Staphylococcus aureus produces siderophores but genetic information underlying their synthesis and transport is limited. Previous work implicated the sbn operon in siderophore synthesis and the sirABC operon in uptake. Here we characterize a second siderophore biosynthetic locus in S. aureus; the locus consists of four genes (in strain Newman these open reading frames are designated NWMN_2079-2082) which, together, are responsible for the synthesis and export of staphyloferrin A, a polycarboxylate siderophore. While deletion of the NWMN_2079-2082 locus did not affect iron-restricted growth of S. aureus, strains bearing combined sbn and NWMN_2079-2082 locus deletions produced no detectable siderophore and demonstrated severely attenuated iron-restricted growth. Adjacent to NWMN_2079-2082 resides the htsABC operon, encoding an ABC transporter previously implicated in haem acquisition. We provide evidence here that HtsABC, along with the FhuC ATPase, is required for the uptake of staphyloferrin A. The crystal structure of apo-HtsA was determined and identified a large positively charged region in the substrate-binding pocket, in agreement with a role in binding of anionic staphyloferrin A.	1
Title: LytM factors affect the recruitment of autolysins to the cell division site in Caulobacter crescentus Abstract: Most bacteria possess a peptidoglycan cell wall that determines their morphology and provides mechanical robustness during osmotic challenges. The biosynthesis of this structure is achieved by a large set of synthetic and lytic enzymes with varying substrate specificities. Although the biochemical functions of these proteins are conserved and well-investigated, the precise roles of individual factors and the regulatory mechanisms coordinating their activities in time and space remain incompletely understood. Here, we comprehensively analyze the autolytic machinery of the alphaproteobacterial model organism Caulobacter crescentus, with a specific focus on LytM-like endopeptidases, soluble lytic transglycosylases and amidases. Our data reveal a high degree of redundancy within each protein family but also specialized functions for individual family members under stress conditions. In addition, we identify two lytic transglycosylases and an amidase as new divisome components that are recruited to midcell at distinct stages of the cell cycle. The midcell localization of these proteins is affected by two LytM factors with degenerate catalytic domains, DipM and LdpF, which may serve as regulatory hubs coordinating the activities of multiple autolytic enzymes during cell constriction and fission respectively. These findings set the stage for in-depth studies of the molecular mechanisms that control peptidoglycan remodeling in C. crescentus.	0
Title: Bioavailability of Carbohydrate Content in Natural and Transgenic Switchgrasses for the Extreme Thermophile Caldicellulosiruptor bescii Abstract: Improving access to the carbohydrate content of lignocellulose is key to reducing recalcitrance for microbial deconstruction and conversion to fuels and chemicals. Caldicellulosiruptor bescii completely solubilizes naked microcrystalline cellulose, yet this transformation is impeded within the context of the plant cell wall by a network of lignin and hemicellulose. Here, the bioavailability of carbohydrates to C. bescii at 70°C was examined for reduced lignin transgenic switchgrass lines COMT3(+) and MYB Trans, their corresponding parental lines (cultivar Alamo) COMT3(-) and MYB wild type (WT), and the natural variant cultivar Cave-in-Rock (CR). Transgenic modification improved carbohydrate solubilization by C. bescii to 15% (2.3-fold) for MYB and to 36% (1.5-fold) for COMT, comparable to the levels achieved for the natural variant, CR (36%). Carbohydrate solubilization was nearly doubled after two consecutive microbial fermentations compared to one microbial step, but it never exceeded 50% overall. Hydrothermal treatment (180°C) prior to microbial steps improved solubilization 3.7-fold for the most recalcitrant line (MYB WT) and increased carbohydrate recovery to nearly 50% for the least recalcitrant lines [COMT3(+) and CR]. Alternating microbial and hydrothermal steps (T→M→T→M) further increased bioavailability, achieving carbohydrate solubilization ranging from 50% for MYB WT to above 70% for COMT3(+) and CR. Incomplete carbohydrate solubilization suggests that cellulose in the highly lignified residue was inaccessible; indeed, residue from the T→M→T→M treatment was primarily glucan and inert materials (lignin and ash). While C. bescii could significantly solubilize the transgenic switchgrass lines and natural variant tested here, additional or alternative strategies (physical, chemical, enzymatic, and/or genetic) are needed to eliminate recalcitrance.IMPORTANCE Key to a microbial process for solubilization of plant biomass is the organism's access to the carbohydrate content of lignocellulose. Economically viable routes will characteristically minimize physical, chemical, and biological pretreatment such that microbial steps contribute to the greatest extent possible. Recently, transgenic versions of plants and trees have been developed with the intention of lowering the barrier to lignocellulose conversion, with particular focus on lignin content and composition. Here, the extremely thermophilic bacterium Caldicellulosiruptor bescii was used to solubilize natural and genetically modified switchgrass lines, with and without the aid of hydrothermal treatment. For lignocellulose conversion, it is clear that the microorganism, plant biomass substrate, and processing steps must all be considered simultaneously to achieve optimal results. Whether switchgrass lines engineered for low lignin or natural variants with desirable properties are used, conversion will depend on microbial access to crystalline cellulose in the plant cell wall.	0
Title: Chemical crosslinking of a solubilized enkephalin macromolecular complex Abstract: Covalently bound [3H]D-Ala2,Met5-enkephalinamide- and 125I-labeled D-Ala2,N-Me-Phe4,Met-(O)5-ol-enkephalin-macromolecule complexes have been prepared by crosslinking the solubilized noncovalent complexes from rat brain. Gel electrophoresis of the partially purified 125I-labeled enkephalin-macromolecule complex under nondenaturing conditions results in a single major/radioactive peak. The complex has a Stokes radius of approximately 48 A as determined by molecular exclusion chromatography; this radius corresponds to a molecular weight of 380,000 for a spherical molecule. In preliminary experiments, sodium dodecyl sulfate electrophoresis of the complex shows a major radioactive peak corresponding to a molecular weight of 35,000. The preparation of these specific covalent enkephalin-macromolecule complexes should be useful in purification of the receptor and in probing the molecular mechanism of opiate action.	0
Title: Genome mining of the sordarin biosynthetic gene cluster from Sordaria araneosa Cain ATCC 36386: characterization of cycloaraneosene synthase and GDP-6-deoxyaltrose transferase Abstract: Sordarin is a glycoside antibiotic with a unique tetracyclic diterpene aglycone structure called sordaricin. To understand its intriguing biosynthetic pathway that may include a Diels-Alder-type [4+2]cycloaddition, genome mining of the gene cluster from the draft genome sequence of the producer strain, Sordaria araneosa Cain ATCC 36386, was carried out. A contiguous 67 kb gene cluster consisting of 20 open reading frames encoding a putative diterpene cyclase, a glycosyltransferase, a type I polyketide synthase, and six cytochrome P450 monooxygenases were identified. In vitro enzymatic analysis of the putative diterpene cyclase SdnA showed that it catalyzes the transformation of geranylgeranyl diphosphate to cycloaraneosene, a known biosynthetic intermediate of sordarin. Furthermore, a putative glycosyltransferase SdnJ was found to catalyze the glycosylation of sordaricin in the presence of GDP-6-deoxy-d-altrose to give 4'-O-demethylsordarin. These results suggest that the identified sdn gene cluster is responsible for the biosynthesis of sordarin. Based on the isolated potential biosynthetic intermediates and bioinformatics analysis, a plausible biosynthetic pathway for sordarin is proposed.	1
Title: Biosynthesis of polyketides by trans-AT polyketide synthases Abstract: This review discusses the biosynthesis of natural products that are generated by trans-AT polyketide synthases, a family of catalytically versatile enzymes that have recently been recognized as one of the major group of proteins involved in the production of bioactive polyketides. 436 references are cited.	1
Title: Biosynthesis of 2'-Chloropentostatin and 2'-Amino-2'-Deoxyadenosine Highlights a Single Gene Cluster Responsible for Two Independent Pathways in Actinomadura sp. Strain ATCC 39365 Abstract: 2'-Chloropentostatin (2'-Cl PTN, 2'-chloro-2'-deoxycoformycin) and 2'-amino-2'-deoxyadenosine (2'-amino dA) are two adenosine-derived nucleoside antibiotics coproduced by Actinomadura sp. strain ATCC 39365. 2'-Cl PTN is a potent adenosine deaminase (ADA) inhibitor featuring an intriguing 1,3-diazepine ring, as well as a chlorination at C-2' of ribose, and 2'-amino dA is an adenosine analog showing bioactivity against RNA-type virus infection. However, the biosynthetic logic of them has remained poorly understood. Here, we report the identification of a single gene cluster (ada) essential for the biosynthesis of 2'-Cl PTN and 2'-amino dA. Further systematic genetic investigations suggest that 2'-Cl PTN and 2'-amino dA are biosynthesized by independent pathways. Moreover, we provide evidence that a predicted cation/H+ antiporter, AdaE, is involved in the chlorination step during 2'-Cl PTN biosynthesis. Notably, we demonstrate that 2'-amino dA biosynthesis is initiated by a Nudix hydrolase, AdaJ, catalyzing the hydrolysis of ATP. Finally, we reveal that the host ADA (designated ADA1), capable of converting adenosine/2'-amino dA to inosine/2'-amino dI, is not very sensitive to the powerful ADA inhibitor pentostatin. These findings provide a basis for the further rational pathway engineering of 2'-Cl PTN and 2'-amino dA production.IMPORTANCE 2'-Cl PTN/PTN and 2'-amino dA have captivated the great interests of scientists, owing to their unusual chemical structures and remarkable bioactivities. However, the precise logic for their biosynthesis has been elusive for decades. Actually, the identification and elucidation of their biosynthetic pathways not only enrich the biochemical repertoire of novel enzymatic reactions but may also lay solid foundations for the pathway engineering and combinatorial biosynthesis of this family of purine nucleoside antibiotics to generate novel hybrid analogs with improved features.	1
Title: Primary structure of a putative serine protease specific for IGF-binding proteins Abstract: From a subtracted cDNA library we have isolated a cDNA clone coding for a novel transformation-sensitive protein which is expressed by human fibroblasts, but not by their matched SV40 transformed counterparts. This protein has a molecular mass of 51 kDa and is highly related to the HtrA family of serine proteases from bacteria. At the N-terminal end, it contains an IGF-binding domain which may modulate the activity of the associated serine protease. Our data are consistent with the assumption that the novel protein represents one of the proteases that regulate the availability of IGFs by cleaving IGF-binding proteins.	0
Title: Histone H2A.Z cooperates with RNAi and heterochromatin factors to suppress antisense RNAs Abstract: Eukaryotic transcriptomes are characterized by widespread transcription of noncoding and antisense RNAs, which is linked to key chromosomal processes, such as chromatin remodelling, gene regulation and heterochromatin assembly. However, these transcripts can be deleterious, and their accumulation is suppressed by several mechanisms including degradation by the nuclear exosome. The mechanisms by which cells differentiate coding RNAs from transcripts targeted for degradation are not clear. Here we show that the variant histone H2A.Z, which is loaded preferentially at the 5' ends of genes by the Swr1 complex containing a JmjC domain protein, mediates suppression of antisense transcripts in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe genome. H2A.Z is partially redundant in this regard with the Clr4 (known as SUV39H in mammals)-containing heterochromatin silencing complex that is also distributed at euchromatic loci, and with RNA interference component Argonaute (Ago1). Loss of Clr4 or Ago1 alone has little effect on antisense transcript levels, but cells lacking either of these factors and H2A.Z show markedly increased levels of antisense RNAs that are normally degraded by the exosome. These analyses suggest that as well as performing other functions, H2A.Z is a component of a genome indexing mechanism that cooperates with heterochromatin and RNAi factors to suppress read-through antisense transcripts.	0
Title: Complete genome sequence of Streptomyces sp. CNQ-509, a prolific producer of meroterpenoid chemistry Abstract: Streptomyces sp. CNQ-509 is a marine actinomycete belonging to the MAR4 streptomycete lineage. MAR4 strains have been linked to the production of diverse and otherwise rare meroterpenoid compounds. The genome sequence of Streptomyces sp. CNQ-509 was found to contain 29 putative gene clusters for the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, some of them potentially involved in the formation of meroterpenoid molecules.	1
Title: Effects of ethylenediaminetetraacetate and chloramphenicol on mitochondrial activity and morphogenesis in Mucor rouxii Abstract: The present study demonstrates the importance of mitochondrial activities in controlling Mucor rouxii morphogenesis. The respiratory capacity of the spores of this facultatively anaerobic, dimorphic fungus becomes repressed if germination and growth take place in the absence of oxygen. The level of activity of mitochondrial enzymes such as cytochrome oxidase and malate dehydrogenase is lower in the anaerobic yeastlike cells than it is in ungerminated spores and in aerobic hyphae, but the reverse is true for glycolytic enzymes such as pyruvate kinase and alcohol dehydrogenase. Following exposure to air, yeastlike cells convert into hyphae after a lag period corresponding to aerobic adaptation. Anaerobic cultures grown in the presence of ethylenediaminetetraacetate (EDTA) at a concentration of 10(-4) M exhibit hyphal morphology. These cells, which are fully adapted to anaerobic fermentation, nevertheless have potentially active mitochondria with the same levels of respiratory enzymes as ungerminated spores. These cells are able to grow immediately after aeration, without an adaptation lag. Evidence is presented which indicates that the morphogenetic effect of EDTA is not the result of elimination of free metals. Additional evidence proving mitochondrial control of morphogenesis in M. rouxii is that chloramphenicol (4 mg/ml) induced the formation of respiratory-deficient, yeastlike cells in aerobic cultures.	0
Title: Biophysical Mechanistic Modelling Quantifies the Effects of Plant Traits on Fire Severity: Species, Not Surface Fuel Loads, Determine Flame Dimensions in Eucalypt Forests Abstract: The influence of plant traits on forest fire behaviour has evolutionary, ecological and management implications, but is poorly understood and frequently discounted. We use a process model to quantify that influence and provide validation in a diverse range of eucalypt forests burnt under varying conditions. Measured height of consumption was compared to heights predicted using a surface fuel fire behaviour model, then key aspects of our model were sequentially added to this with and without species-specific information. Our fully specified model had a mean absolute error 3.8 times smaller than the otherwise identical surface fuel model (p < 0.01), and correctly predicted the height of larger (≥1 m) flames 12 times more often (p < 0.001). We conclude that the primary endogenous drivers of fire severity are the species of plants present rather than the surface fuel load, and demonstrate the accuracy and versatility of the model for quantifying this.	0
Title: Role of siderophore biosynthesis in virulence of Staphylococcus aureus: identification and characterization of genes involved in production of a siderophore Abstract: Molecular determinants underlying the production of siderophores in the human and animal pathogen Staphylococcus aureus and the contribution of siderophore production to the virulence of this bacterium have, until now, remained undefined. Here, we show that S. aureus strains RN6390 and Newman produce siderophore when the cells are starved for iron. We further identified and characterized a nine-gene, iron-regulated operon, designated sbn and situated between sirABC and galE on the S. aureus chromosome, that is involved in the production of a siderophore. Mutation of the sbnE gene, in both RN6390 and Newman, eliminates the ability of these strains to produce a siderophore under iron-limited growth conditions, while introduction of multicopy sbnE into sbnE mutants complemented the inability of the mutants to produce the siderophore. sbnE mutants, in both the RN6390 and Newman backgrounds, displayed a drastic growth deficiency, compared to the wild type, in iron-restricted growth medium, whereas no such deficiency was observed during growth in iron-replete medium. Complemented mutants showed a restored ability to grow under iron restriction. We further showed that an sbnE mutant was compromised in a murine kidney abscess model of S. aureus infection, illustrating the importance of siderophore production to the pathogenicity of S. aureus. sbn genes were present in all S. aureus strains tested (and all S. aureus genome sequences) but were undetectable in any of the 13 coagulase-negative staphylococci tested, including Staphylococcus epidermidis.	1
Title: A Genomic View of Lactobacilli and Pediococci Demonstrates that Phylogeny Matches Ecology and Physiology Abstract: Lactobacilli are used widely in food, feed, and health applications. The taxonomy of the genus Lactobacillus, however, is confounded by the apparent lack of physiological markers for phylogenetic groups of lactobacilli and the unclear relationships between the diverse phylogenetic groups. This study used the core and pan-genomes of 174 type strains of Lactobacillus and Pediococcus to establish phylogenetic relationships and to identify metabolic properties differentiating phylogenetic groups. The core genome phylogenetic tree separated homofermentative lactobacilli and pediococci from heterofermentative lactobacilli. Aldolase and phosphofructokinase were generally present in homofermentative but not in heterofermentative lactobacilli; a two-domain alcohol dehydrogenase and mannitol dehydrogenase were present in most heterofermentative lactobacilli but absent in most homofermentative organisms. Other genes were predominantly present in homofermentative lactobacilli (pyruvate formate lyase) or heterofermentative lactobacilli (lactaldehyde dehydrogenase and glycerol dehydratase). Cluster analysis of the phylogenomic tree and the average nucleotide identity grouped the genus Lactobacillus sensu lato into 24 phylogenetic groups, including pediococci, with stable intra- and intergroup relationships. Individual groups may be differentiated by characteristic metabolic properties. The link between phylogeny and physiology that is proposed in this study facilitates future studies on the ecology, physiology, and industrial applications of lactobacilli.	0
Title: The pvc gene cluster of Pseudomonas aeruginosa: role in synthesis of the pyoverdine chromophore and regulation by PtxR and PvdS Abstract: A putative operon of four genes implicated in the synthesis of the chromophore moiety of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa siderophore pyoverdine, dubbed pvcABCD (where pvc stands for pyoverdine chromophore), was cloned and sequenced. Mutational inactivation of the pvc genes abrogated pyoverdine biosynthesis, consistent with their involvement in the biosynthesis of this siderophore. pvcABCD expression was negatively regulated by iron and positively regulated by both PvdS, the alternate sigma factor required for pyoverdine biosynthesis, and PtxR, a LysR family activator previously implicated in exotoxin A regulation.	1
Title: Two pathways for pyrrole formation in coumermycin A(1) biosynthesis: the central pyrrole moiety is formed from L-threonine Abstract: Coumermycin A(1) is an aminocoumarin antibiotic produced by Streptomyces rishiriensis. It contains three pyrrole rings, that is, two terminal 5-methyl-pyrrole-2-carboxyl moieties and a central 3-methylpyrrole-2,4-dicarboxylic acid moiety. The biosynthesis of the terminal pyrrole moieties has been elucidated previously. However, the biosynthetic precursors of the central pyrrole moiety have remained unknown, and none of the genes or enzymes involved in its formation has been identified. We now show that five genes, contained in a contiguous 4.7 kb region within the coumermycin biosynthetic gene cluster, are required for the biosynthesis of this central pyrrole moiety. Each of these genes was deleted individually, resulting in a strong reduction or an abolishment of coumermycin production. External feeding of the central pyrrole moiety restored coumermycin production. One of these genes shows similarity to L-threonine kinase genes. Feeding of [U-(13)C,(15) N]L-threonine and (13)C NMR analysis of the resulting compound unequivocally proved that threonine was incorporated intact into the central pyrrole (19 % enrichment) to provide the heterocyclic nitrogen as well as four of the seven carbons of this moiety. Therefore, this pyrrole is formed via a new, hitherto unknown biosynthetic pathway. A hypothesis for the reaction sequence leading to the central pyrrole moiety of coumermycin A(1) is presented.	1
Title: A Bifunctional Leader Peptidase/ABC Transporter Protein Is Involved in the Maturation of the Lasso Peptide Cochonodin I from Streptococcus suis Abstract: Lasso peptides are members of the natural product superfamily of ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides (RiPPs). Here, we describe the first lasso peptide originating from a biosynthetic gene cluster belonging to a unique lasso peptide subclade defined by the presence of a bifunctional protein harboring both a leader peptidase (B2) and an ABC transporter (D) domain. Bioinformatic analysis revealed that these clusters also encode homologues of the NisR/NisK regulatory system and the NisF/NisE/NisG immunity factors, which are usually associated with the clusters of antimicrobial class I lanthipeptides, such as nisin, another distinct RiPP subfamily. The cluster enabling the heterologous production of the lasso peptide cochonodin I in E. coli originated from Streptococcus suis LSS65, and the threaded structure of cochonodin I was evidenced through extensive MS/MS analysis and stability assays. It was shown that the ABC transporter domain from SsuB2/D is not essential for lasso peptide maturation. By extensive genome mining dedicated exclusively to other lasso peptide biosynthetic gene clusters featuring bifunctional B2/D proteins, it was furthermore revealed that many bacteria associated with human or animal microbiota hold the biosynthetic potential to produce cochonodin-like lasso peptides, implying that these natural products might play roles in human and animal health.	1
Title: Characterization of an amsacrine-resistant line of human leukemia cells. Evidence for a drug-resistant form of topoisomerase II Abstract: HL-60/AMSA is a human leukemia cell line that is 100 times more resistant to the cytotoxic actions of the antineoplastic, topoisomerase II-reactive DNA intercalating acridine derivative amsacrine (m-AMSA) than is its parent HL-60 line. HL-60/AMSA cells are minimally resistant to etoposide, a topoisomerase II-reactive drug that does not intercalate. Previously we showed that HL-60 topoisomerase II activity in cells, nuclei, or nuclear extracts was sensitive to m-AMSA and etoposide, while HL-60/AMSA topoisomerase II was resistant to m-AMSA but sensitive to etoposide. Now we show that purified topoisomerase II from the two cell lines exhibits the same drug sensitivity or resistance as that in the nuclear extracts although the magnitude of the m-AMSA resistance of HL-60/AMSA topoisomerase II in vitro is not as great as the resistance of the intact HL-60/AMSA cells. In addition HL-60/AMSA cells are cross-resistant to topoisomerase II-reactive intercalators from the anthracycline and ellipticine families and the pattern of sensitivity or resistance to the cytotoxic actions of the various topoisomerase II-reactive drugs is paralleled by topoisomerase II-reactive drug-induced DNA cleavage and protein cross-link production in cells and the production of drug-induced, topoisomerase II-mediated DNA cleavage and protein cross-linking in isolated biochemical systems. In addition to its lowered sensitivity to intercalators, HL-60/AMSA differed from HL-60 in 1) the susceptibility of its topoisomerase II to stimulation of DNA topoisomerase II complex formation by ATP, 2) the catalytic activity of its topoisomerase II in an ionic environment chosen to reproduce the environment found within the living cell, and 3) the observed restriction enzyme pattern on a Southern blot probed with a cDNA for human topoisomerase II. These data indicate that an m-AMSA-resistant form of topoisomerase II contributes to the resistance of HL-60/AMSA to m-AMSA and to other topoisomerase II-reactive DNA intercalating agents. The drug resistance is associated with additional biochemical and molecular alterations that may be important determinants of cellular sensitivity or resistance to topoisomerase II-reactive drugs.	0
Title: Methyltransferase genes in Streptomyces rishiriensis: new coumermycin derivatives from gene-inactivation experiments Abstract: The coumarin antibiotic coumermycin A(1) contains at least eight methyl groups, presumably derived from S-adenosylmethionine. Two putative methyltransferase genes, couO and couP, of the coumermycin A(1) biosynthetic gene cluster were inactivated by in-frame deletion. In the resulting mutants, coumermycin A(1) production was abolished. New coumermycin derivatives were accumulated instead, and were identified by HPLC-MS using selected reaction monitoring via electrospray ionization. couO mutants accumulated a coumermycin derivative lacking the methyl groups at C-8 of the characteristic aminocoumarin rings, whereas in the couP mutant a coumermycin derivative lacking the methyl groups at the 4-hydroxyl groups of the two deoxysugar moieties was identified. These results provided evidence that couO encodes a C-methyltransferase responsible for the transfer of a methyl group to C-8 of the aminocoumarin ring, and couP an O-methyltransferase for methylation of 4-OH of the sugar in the biosynthesis of coumermycin A(1), respectively. C-methylation of the aminocoumarin ring is considered as an early step of coumermycin biosynthesis. Nevertheless, the intermediates with the non-methylated aminocoumarin ring were accepted by the enzymes catalysing the subsequent steps of the pathway. The new, demethylated secondary metabolites were produced in an amount at least as high as that of coumermycin A(1) in the wild-type.	1
Title: Type 1 capsule genes of Staphylococcus aureus are carried in a staphylococcal cassette chromosome genetic element Abstract: The cap1 genes are required for the synthesis of type 1 capsular polysaccharide (CP1) in Staphylococcus aureus. We previously showed that the cap1 locus was associated with a discrete genetic element in S. aureus M. In this report, we defined the boundaries of the cap1 element by comparing its restriction pattern to that of a corresponding region from the CP1-negative strain Becker. The element was located in the SmaI-G chromosomal fragment of the standard mapping strain NCTC8325. The sequences of the entire cap1 element and the flanking regions were determined. We found that there were two additional cap1 genes not previously identified. The cap1 operon was located in a staphylococcal cassette chromosome (SCC) element similar to the resistance island SCCmec recently described for methicillin resistance in S. aureus. Notably, the SCCcap1 element was located at the same insertion site as all the SCCmec elements in the staphylococcal chromosome. The excision of SCCcap1 could be demonstrated only in the presence of the recombinase genes from an SCCmec element, verifying that SCCcap1 is a genuine SCC element but defective in mobilization. A novel enterotoxin gene, whose transcript was detected by Northern blotting, was found next to the SCCcap1 locus. We propose that the enterotoxin gene and SCCcap1 were inserted into this locus at the juxtaposition by independent events. Sequence comparison revealed numerous DNA rearrangements and mutations in SCCcap1 and the left flanking region, suggesting that the SCCcap1 had been inserted at the SCC attC site a long time ago. In addition, most genes in this region were incomplete, with the exception of the 15 cap1 genes, implying that the cap1 genes confer a survival advantage on strain M.	1
Title: Covalent CouN7 enzyme intermediate for acyl group shuttling in aminocoumarin biosynthesis Abstract: The last stages of assembly of the aminocoumarin antibiotics, clorobiocin and coumermycin A(1), which target the GyrB subunits of bacterial DNA gyrase, involve enzymatic transfer of the pyrrolyl-2-carbonyl acyl group from a carrier protein (CloN1/CouN1) to the 3'-OH of the noviosyl moiety of the antibiotic scaffold. The enzyme, CouN7, will catalyze both the forward and back reaction on both arms of the coumermycin scaffold. This occurs via an O-acyl-Ser(101)-CouN7 intermediate, as shown by transient labeling of the enzyme with [(14)C]acetyl-S-CouN1 as donor and by inactivating mutation of the active site, Ser(101), to Ala. The intermediacy of the pyrrolyl-2-carbonyl-O-CouN7 allows net pyrrole transfer between distinct aminocoumarin scaffolds, for example, between the descarbamoylnovobiocin scaffold and coumermycin A(1) and vice versa. CouN7 also allows shuttling of surrogate acyl groups between noviosyl-aminocoumarin scaffolds to generate new antibiotic variants.	1
Title: High-Throughput Screening for Substrate Specificity-Adapted Mutants of the Nisin Dehydratase NisB Abstract: Microbial lanthipeptides are formed by a two-step enzymatic introduction of (methyl)lanthionine rings. A dehydratase catalyzes the dehydration of serine and threonine residues, yielding dehydroalanine and dehydrobutyrine, respectively. Cyclase-catalyzed coupling of the formed dehydroresidues to cysteines forms (methyl)lanthionine rings in a peptide. Lanthipeptide biosynthetic systems allow discovery of target-specific, lanthionine-stabilized therapeutic peptides. However, the substrate specificity of existing modification enzymes impose limitations on installing lanthionines in non-natural substrates. The goal of the present study was to obtain a lanthipeptide dehydratase with the capacity to dehydrate substrates that are unsuitable for the nisin dehydratase NisB. We report high-throughput screening for tailored specificity of intracellular, genetically encoded NisB dehydratases. The principle is based on the screening of bacterially displayed lanthionine-constrained streptavidin ligands, which have a much higher affinity for streptavidin than linear ligands. The designed NisC-cyclizable high-affinity ligands can be formed via mutant NisB-catalyzed dehydration but less effectively via wild-type NisB activity. In Lactococcus lactis, a cell surface display precursor was designed comprising DSHPQFC. The Asp residue preceding the serine in this sequence disfavors its dehydration by wild-type NisB. The cell surface display vector was coexpressed with a mutant NisB library and NisTC. Subsequently, mutant NisB-containing bacteria that display cyclized strep ligands on the cell surface were selected via panning rounds with streptavidin-coupled magnetic beads. In this way, a NisB variant with a tailored capacity of dehydration was obtained, which was further evaluated with respect to its capacity to dehydrate nisin mutants. These results demonstrate a powerful method for selecting lanthipeptide modification enzymes with adapted substrate specificity.	0
Title: Fully reagent-controlled asymmetric synthesis of (-)-spongidepsin via the Zr-catalyzed asymmetric carboalumination of alkenes (ZACA reaction) Abstract: The ZACA reaction has been shown to proceed satisfactorily with internally OH-substituted 1-alkenes, provided that the OH group is unprotected and non-allylic. This reaction was used for reagent-controlled asymmetric construction of 3. Allylic alcohol was converted to 2 in seven steps via iterative ZACA processes and simple chromatography. (-)-Spongidepsin (1) was synthesized by using 2 and 3 through application of the esterification-amidation-ring-closing metathesis protocol previously reported.	0
Title: Anthracycline metabolites from baumycin-producing Streptomyces sp. D788. II. New anthracycline metabolites produced by a blocked mutant strain RPM-5 Abstract: A daunorubicin-blocked mutant strain RPM-5 derived from a new baumycin-producing Streptomyces sp. D788 accumulated a major precursor metabolite D788-1 (10-carboxyl-13-deoxocarminomycin) and nine minor metabolites in the culture broth. Five among them were new with a substituent at C-10 or the altered side chains at C-9. Isolation, purification and identification of all anthracycline metabolites produced by strain RPM-5 are described with their antitumor activities against L1210 cells.	0
Title: Functional characterization of MpaG', the O-methyltransferase involved in the biosynthesis of mycophenolic acid Abstract: Mycophenolic acid (MPA, 1) is a clinically important immunosuppressant. In this report, a gene cluster mpa' responsible for the biosynthesis of 1 was identified from Penicillium brevicompactum NRRL 864. The S-adenosyl-L-methionine-dependent (SAM-dependent) O-methyltransferase encoded by the mpaG' gene was functionally and kinetically characterized in vitro. MpaG' catalyzes the methylation of demethylmycophenolic acid (DMMPA, 6) to form 1. It also showed significant substrate flexibility by methylating two structural derivatives of 6 prepared by organic synthesis.	1
Title: Enzymatic synthesis of resorcylic acid lactones by cooperation of fungal iterative polyketide synthases involved in hypothemycin biosynthesis Abstract: Hypothemycin is a macrolide protein kinase inhibitor from the fungus Hypomyces subiculosus. During biosynthesis, its carbon framework is assembled by two iterative polyketide synthases (PKSs), Hpm8 (highly reducing) and Hpm3 (nonreducing). These were heterologously expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae BJ5464-NpgA, purified to near homogeneity, and reconstituted in vitro to produce (6'S,10'S)-trans-7',8'-dehydrozearalenol (1) from malonyl-CoA and NADPH. The structure of 1 was determined by X-ray crystallographic analysis. In the absence of functional Hpm3, the reducing PKS Hpm8 produces and offloads truncated pyrone products instead of the expected hexaketide. The nonreducing Hpm3 is able to accept an N-acetylcysteamine thioester of a correctly functionalized hexaketide to form 1, but it is unable to initiate polyketide formation from malonyl-CoA. We show that the starter-unit:ACP transacylase (SAT) of Hpm3 is critical for crosstalk between the two enzymes and that the rate of biosynthesis of 1 is determined by the rate of hexaketide formation by Hpm8.	0
Title: Synthesis of cyclic guanidines via Pd-catalyzed alkene carboamination Abstract: A new approach to the synthesis of substituted 5-membered cyclic guanidines is described. Palladium-catalyzed alkene carboamination reactions between acyclic N-allyl guanidines and aryl or alkenyl halides provide these products in good yield. This method allows access to a number of different cyclic guanidine derivatives in only two steps from readily available allylic amines.	0
Title: Analysis of eryBI, eryBIII and eryBVII from the erythromycin biosynthetic gene cluster in Saccharopolyspora erythraea Abstract: The gene cluster (ery) governing the biosynthesis of the macrolide antibiotic erythromycin A by Saccharopolyspora erythraea contains, in addition to the eryA genes encoding the polyketide synthase, two regions containing genes for later steps in the pathway. The region 5' of eryA that lies between the known genes ermE (encoding the erythromycin resistance methyltransferase) and eryBIII (encoding a putative S-adenosylmethionine-dependent methyltransferase), and that contains the gene eryBI (orf2), has now been sequenced. The inferred product of the eryBI gene shows striking sequence similarity to authentic beta-glucosidases. Specific mutants were created in eryBI, and the resulting strains were found to synthesise erythromycin A, showing that this gene, despite its position in the biosynthetic gene cluster, is not essential for erythromycin biosynthesis. A mutant in eryBIII and a double mutant in eryBI and eryBIII were obtained and the analysis of novel erythromycins produced by these strains confirmed the proposed function of EryBIII as a C-methyltransferase. Also, a chromosomal mutant was constructed for the previously sequenced ORF19 and shown to accumulate erythronolide B, as expected for an eryB mutant and consistent with its proposed role as an epimerase in dTDP-mycarose biosynthesis.	1
Title: Use of PCR-targeted mutagenesis to disrupt production of fusaricidin-type antifungal antibiotics in Paenibacillus polymyxa Abstract: Paenibacillus polymyxa (formerly Bacillus polymyxa) PKB1 has been identified as a potential agent for biocontrol of blackleg disease of canola, caused by the pathogenic fungus Leptosphaeria maculans. The factors presumed to contribute to disease suppression by strain PKB1 include the production of fusaricidin-type antifungal metabolites that appear around the onset of bacterial sporulation. The fusaricidins are a family of lipopeptide antibiotics consisting of a beta-hydroxy fatty acid linked to a cyclic hexapeptide. Using a reverse genetic approach based on conserved motifs of nonribosomal peptide synthetases, a DNA fragment that appears to encode the first two modules of the putative fusaricidin synthetase (fusA) was isolated from PKB1. To confirm the involvement of fusA in production of fusaricidins, a modified PCR targeting mutagenesis protocol was developed to create a fusA mutation in PKB1. A DNA fragment internal to fusA was replaced by a gene disruption cassette containing two antibiotic resistance genes for independent selection of apramycin resistance in Escherichia coli and chloramphenicol resistance in P. polymyxa. Inclusion of an oriT site in the disruption cassette allowed efficient transfer of the inactivated fusA allele to P. polymyxa by intergeneric conjugation. Targeted disruption of fusA led to the complete loss of antifungal activity against L. maculans, suggesting that fusA plays an essential role in the nonribosomal synthesis of fusaricidins.	1
Title: Cloning of the gene cluster responsible for biosynthesis of KS-505a (longestin), a unique tetraterpenoid Abstract: KS-505a (longestin), produced by Streptomyces argenteolus, has a unique structure that consists of a tetraterpene (C40) skeleton, to which a 2-O-methylglucuronic acid and an o-succinyl benzoate moiety are attached. It is a novel inhibitor of calmodulin-dependent cyclic-nucleotide phosphodiesterase, which is representative of a potent anti-amnesia drug. As a first step to understanding the biosynthetic machinery of this unique and pharmaceutically useful compound, we cloned a KS505a biosynthetic gene cluster. First we searched for a gene encoding octaprenyl diphosphates, which yielded a C40 precursor by PCR, and four candidate genes were obtained. Among these, one was confirmed to have the expected enzyme activity by recombinant enzyme assay. On the basis of an analysis of the flanking regions of the gene, a putative KS-505a biosynthetic gene cluster consisting of 24 ORFs was judged perhaps to be present on a 28-kb DNA fragment. A gene disruption experiment was also employed to confirm that the cluster indeed participated in KS-505a biosynthesis. This is believed to be the first report detailing the gene cluster of a cyclized tetraterpenoid.	1
Title: The structural basis of an NADP⁺-independent dithiol oxidase in FK228 biosynthesis Abstract: The disulfide bond is unusual in natural products and critical for thermal stability, cell permeability and bioactivity. DepH from Chromobacterium violaceum No. 968 is an FAD-dependent enzyme responsible for catalyzing the disulfide bond formation of FK228, an anticancer prodrug approved for the treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. Here we report the crystal structures of DepH and DepH complexed with a substrate analogue S,S'-dimethyl FK228 at 1.82 Å and 2.00 Å, respectively. Structural and biochemical analyses revealed that DepH, in contrast to the well characterized low molecular weight thioredoxin reductases (LMW TrxRs), is an NADP(+)-independent dithiol oxidase. DepH not only lacks a conserved GGGDXAXE motif necessary for NADP(+) binding in the canonical LMW TrxRs, but also contains a 11-residue sequence which physically impedes the binding of NADP(+). These observations explain the difference between NADP(+)-independent small molecule dithiol oxidases and NADP(+)-dependent thioredoxin reductases and provide insights for understanding the catalytic mechanism of dithiol oxidases involved in natural product biosynthesis.	1
Title: The role of calcium in lipoprotein release by the low-density lipoprotein receptor Abstract: The LDL receptor (LDLR) mediates efficient endocytosis of VLDL, VLDL remnants, and LDL. As part of the uptake process, the LDLR releases lipoproteins in endosomes. Released lipoproteins are subsequently trafficked to lysosomes for degradation, while the LDLR recycles back to the cell surface for further rounds of uptake. Endosomes have at least two features that can promote lipoprotein release: an acidic pH and low concentrations of free calcium. The relative contributions of acidic pH and low free calcium to lipoprotein release are not known. Here, we generated fibroblasts that express either normal LDLR or an LDLR variant that is unable to employ the acid-dependent release mechanism to determine the relative contributions of acidic pH and low free calcium on lipoprotein release. We show that endosomal concentrations of free calcium can drive lipoprotein release at rates that are similar to those of acid-dependent release and that the calcium-dependent and acid-dependent mechanisms can cooperate during lipoprotein release. Assessment of lipoprotein uptake by these two cell lines showed that LDL uptake requires the acid-dependent mechanism, while uptake of the VLDL remnant, beta-VLDL, does not. We propose that endosomes use both the acid-dependent and calcium-dependent release mechanisms to drive lipoprotein release and that the acid-dependent process is only required for LDL release.	0
Title: Polyamines are required for the expression of key Hms proteins important for Yersinia pestis biofilm formation Abstract: We previously showed that mutations in the genes encoding the two main biosynthetic enzymes responsible for polyamine production, arginine decarboxylase (SpeA) and ornithine decarboxylase (SpeC) cause a loss of biofilm formation in Yersinia pestis. In Y. pestis the development of a biofilm is dependent on 6 Hms (hemin storage) proteins (HmsH, F, R, S, T and P) grouped into 3 operons; hmsHFRS, hmsT and hmsP. In this article we show that polyamines are necessary to maintain the levels of key Hms proteins. In the absence of polyamines there is an approximately 93%, approximately 43% and approximately 90% reduction in protein levels of HmsR, HmsS and HmsT respectively. Overexpression of hmsR and hmsT from plasmids alone can restore biofilm formation to a SpeA(-)SpeC(-) mutant. Addition of exogenous putrescine also restores normal levels of HmsR, HmsS, HmsT and biofilm production. Analyses using transcriptional reporters and quantitative RT-PCR indicate that the initiation of transcription and mRNA stability are not reduced by polyamine deficiency. Instead, translational reporters indicate that polyamines function at least in part by modulating the translation of HmsR and HmsT. Although construction of a consensus Shine-Dalgarno sequence upstream of hmsT modestly reduced the stimulation of translation by putrescine, additional mechanisms likely contribute to the polyamine-dependent expression of HmsT. Finally, we have shown that polyamines play a role in bubonic plague.	0
Title: Bactericidal efficiency and modes of action of the novel antimicrobial peptide T9W against Pseudomonas aeruginosa Abstract: The antipseudomonal efficiency and mechanism of action of a novel engineered antimicrobial peptide, T9W, were evaluated in this study. T9W displayed high activity, with a lethal concentration (LC) of 1 to 4 μM against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, including against ciprofloxacin-, gentamicin-, and ceftazidime-resistant strains, even in the presence of 50 to 300 mM NaCl, 1 to 5 mM Ca(2+), or 0.5 to 2 mM Mg(2+). The time-kill curve (TKC) analysis demonstrated concentration-dependent activity, with T9W achieving complete killing in less than 30 min at 1× LC and in less than 5 min at 4× LC. Combination TKC analyses additionally demonstrated a synergistic effect with ciprofloxacin and gentamicin. The selectivity of T9W was further supported by its ability to specifically eliminate P. aeruginosa in a coculture with macrophages without toxicity to the mammalian cells. The results from fluorescent measurement indicated that T9W bound to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and induced P. aeruginosa membrane depolarization, and microscopic observations and flow cytometry further indicated that T9W targeted the P. aeruginosa cell membrane and disrupted cytoplasmic membrane integrity, thereby causing cellular content release leading to cell death. This study revealed the potential usefulness of T9W as a novel antimicrobial agent against P. aeruginosa.	0
Title: The diffusible factor synthase XanB2 is a bifunctional chorismatase that links the shikimate pathway to ubiquinone and xanthomonadins biosynthetic pathways Abstract: The diffusible factor synthase XanB2, originally identified in Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris (Xcc), is highly conserved across a wide range of bacterial species, but its substrate and catalytic mechanism have not yet been investigated. Here, we show that XanB2 is a unique bifunctional chorismatase that hydrolyses chorismate, the end-product of the shikimate pathway, to produce 3-hydroxybenzoic acid (3-HBA) and 4-HBA. 3-HBA and 4-HBA are respectively associated with the yellow pigment xanthomonadin biosynthesis and antioxidant activity in Xcc. We further demonstrate that XanB2 is a structurally novel enzyme with three putative domains. It catalyses 3-HBA and 4-HBA biosynthesis via a unique mechanism with the C-terminal YjgF-like domain conferring activity for 3-HBA biosynthesis and the N-terminal FGFG motif-containing domain responsible for 4-HBA biosynthesis. Furthermore, we show that Xcc produces coenzyme Q8 (CoQ8) via a new biosynthetic pathway independent of the key chorismate-pyruvate lyase UbiC. XanB2 is the alternative source of 4-HBA for CoQ8 biosynthesis. The similar CoQ8 biosynthetic pathway, xanthomonadin biosynthetic gene cluster and XanB2 homologues are well conserved in the bacterial species within Xanthomonas, Xylella, Xylophilus, Pseudoxanthomonas, Rhodanobacter, Frateuria, Herminiimonas and Variovorax, suggesting that XanB2 may be a conserved metabolic link between the shikimate pathway, ubiquinone and xanthomonadin biosynthetic pathways in diverse bacteria.	0
Title: Ecological dynamics of toxic Microcystis spp. and microcystin-degrading bacteria in Dianchi Lake, China Abstract: Toxic cyanobacterial blooms directly threaten both human safety and the ecosystem of surface waters. The widespread occurrence of these organisms, coupled with the tumor-promoting properties of the microcystin toxins that they produce, demands action to mitigate their potential impacts and, thus, a robust understanding of their ecological dynamics. In the present work, the abundance of toxic Microcystis spp. and microcystin (MC)-degrading bacteria in Dianchi Lake, located in Yunnan Province, China, was studied using quantitative PCR. Samples were taken at monthly intervals from June 2010 to December 2011 at three sampling stations within this freshwater lake. Results revealed that variation in the abundance of both total Microcystis spp. and toxic Microcystis spp. exhibited similar trends during the period of the algal bloom, including the reinvasion, pelagic growth, sedimentation, and overwintering periods, and that the proportion of toxic Microcystis was highest during the bloom and lowest in winter. Importantly, we observed that peaks in mlrA gene copy numbers of MC-degrading bacteria occurred in the months following observed peaks in MC concentrations. To understand this phenomenon, we added MCs to the MC-degrading bacteria (designated strains HW and SW in this study) and found that MCs significantly enhanced mlrA gene copy numbers over the number for the control by a factor of 5.2 for the microcystin-RR treatment and a factor of 3.7 for the microcystin-LR treatment. These results indicate that toxic Microcystis and MC-degrading bacteria exert both direct and indirect effects on each other and that MC-degrading bacteria also mediate a shift from toxic to nontoxic populations of Microcystis.	0
Title: Heterologous expression of intact biosynthetic gene clusters in Fusarium graminearum Abstract: Filamentous fungi such as species from the genus Fusarium are capable of producing a wide palette of interesting metabolites relevant to health, agriculture and biotechnology. Secondary metabolites are formed from large synthase/synthetase enzymes often encoded in gene clusters containing additional enzymes cooperating in the metabolite's biosynthesis. The true potential of fungal metabolomes remain untapped as the majority of secondary metabolite gene clusters are silent under standard laboratory growth conditions. One way to achieve expression of biosynthetic pathways is to clone the responsible genes and express them in a well-suited heterologous host, which poses a challenge since Fusarium polyketide synthase and non-ribosomal peptide synthetase gene clusters can be large (e.g. as large as 80 kb) and comprise several genes necessary for product formation. The major challenge associated with heterologous expression of fungal biosynthesis pathways is thus handling and cloning large DNA sequences. In this paper we present the successful workflow for cloning, reconstruction and heterologous production of two previously characterized Fusarium pseudograminearum natural product pathways in Fusarium graminearum. In vivo yeast recombination enabled rapid assembly of the W493 (NRPS32-PKS40) and the Fusarium Cytokinin gene clusters. F. graminearum transformants were obtained through protoplast-mediated and Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation. Whole genome sequencing revealed isolation of transformants carrying intact copies the gene clusters was possible. Known Fusarium cytokinin metabolites; fusatin, 8-oxo-fusatin, 8-oxo-isopentenyladenine, fusatinic acid together with cis- and trans-zeatin were detected by liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry, which confirmed gene functionality in F. graminearum. In addition the non-ribosomal lipopeptide products W493 A and B was heterologously produced in similar amounts to that observed in the F. pseudograminearum doner. The Fusarium pan-genome comprises more than 60 uncharacterized putative secondary metabolite gene clusters. We nominate the well-characterized F. graminearum as a heterologous expression platform for Fusarium secondary metabolite gene clusters, and present our experience cloning and introducing gene clusters into this species. We expect the presented methods will inspire future endevours in heterologous production of Fusarium metabolites and potentially aid the production and characterization of novel natural products.	1
Title: Cloning, sequencing and deduced functions of a cluster of Streptomyces genes probably encoding biosynthesis of the polyketide antibiotic frenolicin Abstract: A 10.2-kb fragment of DNA from Streptomyces roseofulvus, which contains polyketide synthase (PKS)-encoding genes (fren) presumed to determine production of the antibiotics frenolicin and the nanaomycins, was cloned. A 5530-bp continuous segment of this DNA was sequenced. Analysis of the sequence revealed five complete open reading frames (ORFs) transcribed in one direction (ORFs 1, 2, 3, 5, 4) and one (ORFX), located between ORF3 and ORF5, transcribed in the opposite direction. The deduced amino-acid sequences of ORFs 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 closely resemble the sequences of known components of the type-II PKS from other Streptomyces species: putative heterodimeric (ORF1 + 2) ketosynthase, acyl carrier protein, cyclase and ketoreductase, respectively. A resemblance between the N-terminal and C-terminal halves of the ORF4 product--also discovered in the corresponding genes from other isochromanequinone antibiotic producers--suggests a possible origin of the cyclase-encoding gene by duplication. ORFX appears to represent a novel class of genes of unknown function present not only in the fren cluster, but also in other clusters of aromatic antibiotic biosynthetic genes in Streptomyces species. The fren-ORF1-5 genes, encoding a PKS that constructs a nascent polyketide of either 16 or 18 carbons, compared with fixed lengths of 16 and 20 for other available examples, are proving to be valuable for understanding the mechanisms controlling polyketide chain length and patterns of reduction and cyclisation.	1
Title: Stereoselective synthesis of highly functionalized alpha-diazo-beta-ketoalkanoates via catalytic one-pot Mukaiyama-Aldol reactions Abstract: Methyl diazoacetoacetate undergoes zinc triflate catalyzed condensation with a broad selection of aldehydes to produce delta-siloxy-alpha-diazo-beta-ketoalkanoates in good yield, and delta-hydroxy-alpha-diazo-beta-ketoalkanoates are formed with high diastereoselectivity in reactions with alpha-diazo-beta-ketopentanoate promoted by dibutylboron triflate.	0
Title: Autophosphorylation activity of a soluble hexameric histidine kinase correlates with the shift in protein conformational equilibrium Abstract: In a commonly accepted model, in response to stimuli, bacterial histidine kinases undergo a conformational transition between an active and inactive form. Structural information on histidine kinases is limited. By using ion mobility-mass spectrometry (IM-MS), we demonstrate an exchange between two conformational populations of histidine kinase ExsG that are linked to different levels of kinase activity. ExsG is an atypical signaling protein that incorporates an uncommon histidine kinase catalytic core at the C terminus preceded by an N-terminal "receiver domain" that is normally associated with the response regulator proteins in two-component signal transduction systems. IM-MS analysis and enzymatic assays indicate that phosphorylation of the ExsG receiver domain stabilizes the "compact" form of the protein and inhibits kinase core activity; in contrast, nucleotide binding required for kinase activity is associated with the more open conformation of ExsG.	0
Title: Involvement of the cgtA gene function in stimulation of DNA repair in Escherichia coli and Vibrio harveyi Abstract: CgtA is a member of the Obg/Gtp1 subfamily of small GTP-binding proteins. CgtA homologues have been found in various prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms, ranging from bacteria to humans. Nevertheless, despite the fact that cgtA is an essential gene in most bacterial species, its function in the regulation of cellular processes is largely unknown. Here it has been demonstrated that in two bacterial species, Escherichia coli and Vibrio harveyi, the cgtA gene product enhances survival of cells after UV irradiation. Expression of the cgtA gene was found to be enhanced after UV irradiation of both E. coli and V. harveyi. Moderate overexpression of cgtA resulted in higher UV resistance of E. coli wild-type and dnaQ strains, but not in uvrA, uvrB, umuC and recA mutant hosts. Overexpression of the E. coli recA gene in the V. harveyi cgtA mutant, which is very sensitive to UV light, restored the level of survival of UV-irradiated cells to the levels observed for wild-type bacteria. Moreover, the basal level of the RecA protein was lower in a temperature-sensitive cgtA mutant of E. coli than in the cgtA(+) strain, and contrary to wild-type bacteria, no significant increase in recA gene expression was observed after UV irradiation of this cgtA mutant. Finally, stimulation of uvrB gene transcription under these conditions was impaired in the V. harveyi cgtA mutant. All these results strongly suggest that the cgtA gene product is involved in DNA repair processes, most probably by stimulation of recA gene expression and resultant activation of RecA-dependent DNA repair pathways.	0
Title: Functional characterization and manipulation of the apicidin biosynthetic pathway in Fusarium semitectum Abstract: Apicidin is a cyclic tetrapeptide produced by certain isolates of Fusarium semitectum and has been shown to inhibit Apicomplexan histone deacetylase. An apicidin-producing strain (KCTC16676) of the filamentous fungus was mutated using an Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation, resulting in 24 apicidin-deficient mutants. Three of the mutants had a T-DNA insertion in a gene that encodes a non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS). Results of sequence, expression, and gene deletion analyses defined an apicidin biosynthetic gene cluster, and the NRPS gene was named as apicidin synthetase gene 1 (APS1). A 63 kb region surrounding APS1 was sequenced and analysis revealed the presence of 19 genes. All of the genes including APS1 were individually deleted to determine their roles in apicidin biosynthesis. Chemical analyses of the mutant strains showed that eight genes are required for apicidin production and were used to propose an apicidin biosynthetic pathway. The apicidin analogues apicidin E, apicidin D(2) and apicidin B were identified from chemical analysis of the mutants. The cluster gene APS2, a putative transcription factor, was shown to regulate expression of the genes in the cluster and overexpression of APS2 increased apicidin production. This study establishes the apicidin biosynthetic pathway and provides new opportunities to improve the production of apicidin and produce new analogues.	1
Title: Bifunctional TaqII restriction endonuclease: redefining the prototype DNA recognition site and establishing the Fidelity Index for partial cleaving Abstract: Background:                       The TaqII enzyme is a member of the Thermus sp. enzyme family that we propounded previously within Type IIS restriction endonucleases, containing related thermophilic bifunctional endonucleases-methyltransferases from various Thermus sp.: TaqII, Tth111II, TthHB27I, TspGWI, TspDTI and TsoI. These enzymes show significant nucleotide and amino acid sequence similarities, a rare phenomenon among restriction endonucleases, along with similarities in biochemical properties, molecular size, DNA recognition sequences and cleavage sites. They also feature some characteristics of Types I and III.                  Results:                       Barker et al. reported the Type IIS/IIC restriction endonuclease TaqII as recognizing two distinct cognate site variants (5'-GACCGA-3' and 5'-CACCCA-3') while cleaving 11/9 nucleotides downstream. We used four independent methods, namely, shotgun cloning and sequencing, restriction pattern analysis, digestion of particular custom substrates and GeneScan analysis, to demonstrate that the recombinant enzyme recognizes only 5'-GACCGA-3' sites and cleaves 11/9 nucleotides downstream. We did not observe any 5'-CACCCA-3' cleavage under a variety of conditions and site arrangements tested. We also characterized the enzyme biochemically and established new digestion conditions optimal for practical enzyme applications. Finally, we developed and propose a new version of the Fidelity Index - the Fidelity Index for Partial Cleavage (FI-PC).                  Conclusions:                       The DNA recognition sequence of the bifunctional prototype TaqII endonuclease-methyltransferase from Thermus aquaticus has been redefined as recognizing only 5'-GACCGA-3' cognate sites. The reaction conditions (pH and salt concentrations) were designed either to minimize (pH = 8.0 and 10 mM ammonium sulphate) or to enhance star activity (pH = 6.0 and no salt). Redefinition of the recognition site and reaction conditions makes this prototype endonuclease a useful tool for DNA manipulation; as yet, this enzyme has no practical applications. The extension of the Fidelity Index will be helpful for DNA manipulation with enzymes only partially cleaving DNA.	0
Title: Amycolamycins A and B, Two Enediyne-Derived Compounds from a Locust-Associated Actinomycete Abstract: Two novel enediyne-derived natural products, amycolamycins A and B (1 and 2), were characterized from a locust-associated actinomycete Amycolatopsis sp. HCa4. Amycolamycins A and B contain a unique 2-(cyclopenta[a]inden-5-yl)oxirane core with suspected enediyne polyketide biosynthetic origin. Sequencing and analysis of the acm biosynthetic gene cluster allowed us to propose the biosynthetic pathway of 1 and 2. Moreover, amycolamycin A (1) was selectively cytotoxic to the M231 breast cancer cell line.	1
Title: Thioesterase II of Escherichia coli plays an important role in 3-hydroxydecanoic acid production Abstract: 3-Hydroxydecanoic acid (3HD) was produced in Escherichia coli by mobilizing (R)-3-hydroxydecanoyl-acyl carrier protein-coenzyme A transacylase (PhaG, encoded by the phaG gene). By employing an isogenic tesB (encoding thioesterase II)-negative knockout E. coli strain, CH01, it was found that the expressions of tesB and phaG can up-regulate each other. In addition, 3HD was synthesized from glucose or fructose by recombinant E. coli harboring phaG and tesB. This study supports the hypothesis that the physiological role of thioesterase II in E. coli is to prevent the abnormal accumulation of intracellular acyl-coenzyme A.	0
Title: Ligand-controlled asymmetric arylation of aliphatic α-amino anion equivalents Abstract: A palladium-catalyzed asymmetric arylation of 9-aminofluorene-derived imines using a chiral dialkylbiaryl phosphine as the supporting ligand has been developed.

Title: The principal determinants for the structure of the substrate-binding pocket are located within a central core of a biphenyl dioxygenase alpha subunit Abstract: Protein engineering by segment exchange was used to distinguish between regions of major and minor influence on the structure of the substrate-binding pocket of a biphenyl dioxygenase (BDO). Eight chimaeric enzyme systems were generated that each consisted of a hybrid hydroxylase alpha subunit (BphA1) containing segments from Burkholderia sp. strain LB400 and Rhodococcus globerulus P6, and of a hydroxylase beta subunit (BphA2), a ferredoxin (BphA3) and a ferredoxin reductase (BphA4) from strain LB400. All hybrid bphA1 genes were expressed at high levels. Seven of the resulting fusion subunits functionally interacted with the other polypeptides of the dioxygenase system to yield catalytically active enzymes. Changes in the regiospecificity of substrate attack, monitored by the formation of seventeen different dioxygenation products obtained from seven chlorobiphenyls, were used to monitor effects of segment exchanges on the structure of the BDO substrate-binding site. Exchanges of neither the beta subunit nor the N- and C-terminal regions of the alpha subunit exerted significant influences. All BDO regions that showed major effects on the substrate-binding pocket were located between approximately positions 165 and 395 of the alpha subunit. Within this part of the enzyme, in addition to segments identified previously, a subregion which is involved in ligation of the mononuclear iron significantly influenced the regiospecificity of substrate dioxygenation. Moreover, the results indicate that the construction of appropriate hybrid genes may be used as a general strategy to overcome problems in obtaining heterologous BDO activities in Escherichia coli or other host organisms.	0
Title: Violacein and related tryptophan metabolites produced by Chromobacterium violaceum: biosynthetic mechanism and pathway for construction of violacein core Abstract: Violacein is a natural violet pigment produced by several gram-negative bacteria, including Chromobacterium violaceum, Janthinobacterium lividum, and Pseudoalteromonas tunicata D2, among others. This pigment has potential medical applications as antibacterial, anti-trypanocidal, anti-ulcerogenic, and anticancer drugs. The structure of violacein consists of three units: a 5-hydroxyindole, an oxindole, and a 2-pyrrolidone. The biosynthetic origins of hydrogen, nitrogen, and carbon in the pyrrolidone nucleus were established by feeding experiments using various stable isotopically labeled tryptophans (Trps). Pro-S hydrogen of CH(2) at the 3-position of Trp is retained during biosynthesis. The nitrogen atom is exclusively from the α-amino group, and the skeletal carbon atoms originate from the side chains of the two Trp molecules. All three oxygen atoms in the violacein core are derived from molecular oxygen. The most interesting biosynthetic mechanism is the 1,2-shift of the indole nucleus on the left side of the violacein scaffold. The alternative Trp molecule is directly incorporated into the right side of the violacein core. This indole shift has been observed only in violacein biosynthesis, despite the large number of natural products having been isolated. There were remarkable advances in biosynthetic studies in 2006-2008. During the 3 years, most of the intermediates and the complete pathway were established. Two independent processes are involved: the enzymatic process catalyzed by the five proteins VioABCDE or the alternative nonenzymatic oxidative decarboxylation reactions. The X-ray crystallographic structure of VioE that mediates the indole rearrangement reaction was recently identified, and the mechanism of the indole shift is discussed here.	1
Title: Depsipeptide Aspergillicins Revealed by Chromatin Reader Protein Deletion Abstract: Expression of biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) in filamentous fungi is highly regulated by epigenetic remodeling of chromatin structure. Two classes of histone modifying proteins, writers (which place modifications on histone tails) and erasers (which remove the modifications), have been used extensively to activate cryptic BGCs in fungi. Here, for the first time, we present activation of a cryptic BGC by a third category of histone modifying proteins, reader proteins that recognize histone tail modifications and commonly mediate writer and eraser activity. Loss of the reader SntB (Δ sntB) resulted in the synthesis of two cryptic cyclic hexa-depsipeptides, aspergillicin A and aspergillicin F, in the fungus Aspergillus flavus. Liquid chromatography, high resolution mass spectrometry, and NMR analysis coupled with bioinformatic analysis and gene deletion experiments revealed that a six adenylation (A) domain nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS, called AgiA) and O-methyltransferase (AgiB) were required for metabolite formation. A proposed biosynthetic scheme illustrates the requirement for unusual NRPS domains, such as a starting condensation domain and a thiolesterase domain proposed to cyclize the depsipeptides. This latter activity has only been found in bacterial but not fungal NRPS. The agi BGC-unique to A. flavus and some closely related species (e.g., A. oryzae, A. arachidicola)-is located next to a conserved Aspergillus siderophore BGC syntenic to other fungi.	1
Title: Towards the development of Bacillus subtilis as a cell factory for membrane proteins and protein complexes Abstract: Background:                       The Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis is an important producer of high quality industrial enzymes and a few eukaryotic proteins. Most of these proteins are secreted into the growth medium, but successful examples of cytoplasmic protein production are also known. Therefore, one may anticipate that the high protein production potential of B. subtilis can be exploited for protein complexes and membrane proteins to facilitate their functional and structural analysis. The high quality of proteins produced with B. subtilis results from the action of cellular quality control systems that efficiently remove misfolded or incompletely synthesized proteins. Paradoxically, cellular quality control systems also represent bottlenecks for the production of various heterologous proteins at significant concentrations.                  Conclusion:                       While inactivation of quality control systems has the potential to improve protein production yields, this could be achieved at the expense of product quality. Mechanisms underlying degradation of secretory proteins are nowadays well understood and often controllable. It will therefore be a major challenge for future research to identify and modulate quality control systems of B. subtilis that limit the production of high quality protein complexes and membrane proteins, and to enhance those systems that facilitate assembly of these proteins.	0
Title: Eliciting antibiotics active against the ESKAPE pathogens in a collection of actinomycetes isolated from mountain soils Abstract: The rapid emergence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacterial pathogens poses a major threat for human health. In recent years, genome sequencing has unveiled many poorly expressed antibiotic clusters in actinomycetes. Here, we report a well-defined ecological collection of >800 actinomycetes obtained from sites in the Himalaya and Qinling mountains, and we used these in a concept study to see how efficiently antibiotics can be elicited against MDR pathogens isolated recently from the clinic. Using 40 different growth conditions, 96 actinomycetes were identified - predominantly Streptomyces - that produced antibiotics with efficacy against the MDR clinical isolates referred to as ESKAPE pathogens: Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and/or Enterobacter cloacae. Antimicrobial activities that fluctuated strongly with growth conditions were correlated with specific compounds, including borrelidin, resistomycin, carbomethoxy-phenazine, and 6,7,8- and 5,6,8-trimethoxy-3-methylisocoumarin, of which the latter was not described previously. Our work provided insights into the potential of actinomycetes as producers of drugs with efficacy against clinical isolates that have emerged recently and also underlined the importance of targeting a specific pathogen.	0
Title: Biosynthesis of Neocarazostatin A Reveals the Sequential Carbazole Prenylation and Hydroxylation in the Tailoring Steps Abstract: Neocarazostatin A (NZS) is a bacterial alkaloid with promising bioactivities against free radicals, featuring a tricyclic carbazole nucleus with a prenyl moiety at C-6 of the carbazole ring. Here, we report the discovery and characterization of the biosynthetic pathway of NZS through genome mining and gene inactivation. The in vitro assays characterized two enzymes: NzsA is a P450 hydroxylase and NzsG is a new phytoene-synthase-like prenyltransferase (PTase). This is the first reported native PTase that specifically acts on the carbazole nucleus. Finally, our in vitro reconstituted experiment demonstrated a coupled reaction catalyzed by NzsG and NzsA tailoring the NZS biosynthesis.	1
Title: Effect of starvation on cytoplasmic pH, proton motive force, and viability of an acidophilic bacterium, Thiobacillus acidophilus Abstract: The question of whether Thiobacillus acidophilus maintains its cytoplasmic pH at values close to neutrality by active or passive means was explored by subjecting the organism to long-term starvation (up to 22 days). Starving cells maintained a delta pH of 2 to 3 U throughout starvation, although cellular poly-beta-hydroxybutyric acid and ATP, the proton motive force, and culture viability were low or not detectable after 200 h. Cells exposed to azide or azide plus N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide immediately exhibited characteristics of cells starved for more than 200 h. Thus, a large delta pH in T. acidophilus was maintained in the absence of ATP, ATPase activity, respiration, significant levels of proton motive force, and cell viability and was therefore not dependent on chemiosmotic ionic pumping. The transition from a metabolically active to an inactive state was accompanied by a large increase in the positive membrane potential, which nearly completely compensated for the delta pH in the inactive cells. The longevity of the acidophile during starvation was comparable to that reported previously for neutrophiles, and the loss of viability occurred not because of the acidification of the cytoplasm but apparently because of energy depletion.	0
Title: Characterization of the gene cluster responsible for cylindrospermopsin biosynthesis Abstract: Toxic cyanobacterial blooms cause economic losses and pose significant public health threats on a global scale. Characterization of the gene cluster for the biosynthesis of the cyanobacterial toxin cylindrospermopsin (cyr) in Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii AWT205 is described, and the complete biosynthetic pathway is proposed. The cyr gene cluster spans 43 kb and is comprised of 15 open reading frames containing genes required for the biosynthesis, regulation, and export of the toxin. Biosynthesis is initiated via an amidinotransfer onto glycine followed by five polyketide extensions and subsequent reductions, and rings are formed via Michael additions in a stepwise manner. The uracil ring is formed by a novel pyrimidine biosynthesis mechanism and tailoring reactions, including sulfation and hydroxylation that complete biosynthesis. These findings enable the design of toxic strain-specific probes and allow the future study of the regulation and biological role of cylindrospermopsin.	1
Title: Correspondence regarding "Effect of active smoking on the human bronchial epithelium transcriptome" Abstract: Background:                       In the work of Chari et al. entitled "Effect of active smoking on the human bronchial epithelium transcriptome" the authors use SAGE to identify candidate gene expression changes in bronchial brushings from never, former, and current smokers. These gene expression changes are categorized into those that are reversible or irreversible upon smoking cessation. A subset of these identified genes is validated on an independent cohort using RT-PCR. The authors conclude that their results support the notion of gene expression changes in the lungs of smokers which persist even after an individual has quit.                  Results:                       This correspondence raises questions about the validity of the approach used by the authors to analyze their data. The majority of the reported results suffer deficiencies due to the methods used. The most fundamental of these are explained in detail: biases introduced during data processing, lack of correction for multiple testing, and an incorrect use of clustering for gene discovery. A randomly generated "null" dataset is used to show the consequences of these shortcomings.                  Conclusion:                       Most of Chari et al.'s findings are consistent with what would be expected by chance alone. Although there is clear evidence of reversible changes in gene expression, the majority of those identified appear to be false positives. However, contrary to the authors' claims, no irreversible changes were identified. There is a broad consensus that genetic change due to smoking persists once an individual has quit smoking; unfortunately, this study lacks sufficient scientific rigour to support or refute this hypothesis or identify any specific candidate genes. The pitfalls of large-scale analysis, as exemplified here, may not be unique to Chari et al.	0
Title: Structure determination and interception of biosynthetic intermediates for the plantazolicin class of highly discriminating antibiotics Abstract: The soil-dwelling, plant growth-promoting bacterium Bacillus amyloliquefaciens FZB42 is a prolific producer of complex natural products. Recently, a new FZB42 metabolite, plantazolicin (PZN), has been described as a member of the growing thiazole/oxazole-modified microcin (TOMM) family. TOMMs are biosynthesized from inactive, ribosomal peptides and undergo a series of cyclodehydrations, dehydrogenations, and other modifications to become bioactive natural products. Using high-resolution mass spectrometry, chemoselective modification, genetic interruptions, and other spectroscopic tools, we have determined the molecular structure of PZN. In addition to two conjugated polyazole moieties, the amino-terminus of PZN has been modified to N(α),N(α)-dimethylarginine. PZN exhibited a highly selective antibiotic activity toward Bacillus anthracis, but no other tested human pathogen. By altering oxygenation levels during fermentation, PZN analogues were produced that bear variability in their heterocycle content, which yielded insight into the order of biosynthetic events. Lastly, genome-mining has revealed the existence of four additional PZN-like biosynthetic gene clusters. Given their structural uniqueness and intriguing antimicrobial specificity, the PZN class of antibiotics may hold pharmacological value.	1
Title: Characterization of the Aminosugar Biosynthetic and Regulatory Genes of Vicenistatin in Monodonata labio-Associated Streptomyces parvus SCSIO Mla-L010 Abstract: Vicenistatin (1) is a potent polyketide antitumor antibiotic composed of a 20-membered macrolactam core appended to a unique aminosugar, vicenisamine. In this study, vicenistatin was isolated and its biosynthetic gene cluster identified from Monodonata labio-associated Streptomyces parvus SCSIO Mla-L010. A set of five genes, vicC, vicD, vicE, vicF, and vicG, was confirmed to be involved in the biosynthesis of the aminosugar by gene inactivations. VicG was characterized as an N-methyltransferase that catalyzes the methylation of the 4'-amino group in the last step of the aminosugar biosynthetic pathway; the N-demethyl intermediate 4'-N-demethylvicenistatin (2) was isolated from the ΔvicG mutant strain. In addition, vicR1 was characterized as a positive pathway-specific regulatory gene. Notably, N-demethyl compound 2 was found to exert impressive antibacterial activities, with MIC values spanning 0.06-4 μg/mL, against a panel of Gram-positive bacteria including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Gram-negative Helicobacter pylori, and mycobacterium Mycobacterium smegmatis and the fungal pathogen Candida albicans. Compound 2 was also found to display reduced cytotoxicities relative to vicenistatin, especially against noncancerous human cell lines.	1
Title: The Discovery of Fungal Polyene Macrolides via a Postgenomic Approach Reveals a Polyketide Macrocyclization by trans-Acting Thioesterase in Fungi Abstract: Heterologous expression of a unique biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) comprising a highly reducing polyketide synthase and stand-alone thioesterase genes in Aspergillus oryzae enabled us to isolate a novel 34-membered polyene macrolide, phaeospelide A (1). This is the first isolation of a fungal polyene macrolide and the first demonstration of fungal aliphatic macrolide biosynthetic machinery. In addition, sequence similarity network analysis demonstrated the existence of a large number of BGCs for novel fungal macrolides.	1
Title: RNA elimination machinery targeting meiotic mRNAs promotes facultative heterochromatin formation Abstract: Facultative heterochromatin that changes during cellular differentiation coordinates regulated gene expression, but its assembly is poorly understood. Here, we describe facultative heterochromatin islands in fission yeast and show that their formation at meiotic genes requires factors that eliminate meiotic messenger RNAs (mRNAs) during vegetative growth. Blocking production of meiotic mRNA or loss of RNA elimination factors, including Mmi1 and Red1 proteins, abolishes heterochromatin islands. RNA elimination machinery is enriched at meiotic loci and interacts with Clr4/SUV39h, a methyltransferase involved in heterochromatin assembly. Heterochromatin islands disassemble in response to nutritional signals that induce sexual differentiation. This process involves the antisilencing factor Epe1, the loss of which causes dramatic increase in heterochromatic loci. Our analyses uncover unexpected regulatory roles for mRNA-processing factors that assemble dynamic heterochromatin to modulate gene expression.	0
Title: Protein phosphorylation and intermolecular electron transfer: a joint experimental and computational study of a hormone biosynthesis pathway Abstract: Protein phosphorylation is a common regulator of enzyme activity. Chemical modification of a protein surface, including phosphorylation, could alter the function of biological electron-transfer reactions. However, the sensitivity of intermolecular electron-transfer kinetics to post-translational protein modifications has not been widely investigated. We have therefore combined experimental and computational studies to assess the potential role of phosphorylation in electron-transfer reactions. We investigated the steroid hydroxylating system from bovine adrenal glands, which consists of adrenodoxin (Adx), adrenodoxin reductase (AdR), and a cytochrome P450, CYP11A1. We focused on the phosphorylation of Adx at Thr-71, since this residue is located in the acidic interaction domain of Adx, and a recent study has demonstrated that this residue is phosphorylated by casein kinase 2 (CK2) in vitro.1 Optical biosensor experiments indicate that the presence of this phosphorylation slightly increases the binding affinity of oxidized Adx with CYP11A1ox but not AdRox. This tendency was confirmed by KA values extracted from Adx concentration-dependent stopped-flow experiments that characterize the interaction between AdRred and Adxox or between Adxred and CYP11A1ox. In addition, acceleration of the electron-transfer kinetics measured with stopped-flow is seen only for the phosphorylated Adx-CYP11A1 reaction. Biphasic reaction kinetics are observed only when Adx is phosphorylated at Thr-71, and the Brownian dynamics (BD) simulations suggest that this phosphorylation may enhance the formation of a secondary Adx-CYP11A1 binding complex that provides an additional electron-transfer pathway with enhanced coupling.	0
Title: Genomic organization, sequence analysis and expression of all five genes encoding the small subunit of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase from tomato Abstract: We have cloned and sequenced all five members of the gene family for the small subunit (rbcS) of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase from tomato, Lycopersicon esculentum cv. VFNT LA 1221 cherry line. Two of the five genes, designated Rbcs-1 and Rbcs-2, are present as single genes at individual loci. Three genes, designated Rbcs-3A, Rbcs-3B and Rbcs-3C, are organized in a tandem array within 10 kb at a third independent locus. The Rbcs-2 gene contains three introns; all the other members of the tomato gene family contain two introns. The coding sequence of Rbcs-1 differs by 14.0% from that of Rbcs-2 and by 13.3% from that of Rbcs-3 genes. Rbcs-2 shows 10.4% divergence from Rbcs-3. The exon and intron sequences of Rbcs-3A are identical to those of Rbcs-3C, and differ by 1.9% from those of Rbcs-3B. Nucleotide sequence analysis suggests that the five rbcS genes encode four different precursors, and three different mature polypeptides. S1 nuclease mapping of the 5' end of rbcS mRNAs revealed that the mRNA leader sequences vary in length from 8 to 75 nucleotides. Northern analysis using gene-specific oligonucleotide probes from the 3' non-coding region of each gene reveals a four to five-fold difference among the five genes in maximal steady-state mRNA levels in leaves.	0
Title: Fate of Salmonella montevideo on and in raw tomatoes as affected by temperature and treatment with chlorine Abstract: A study was undertaken to determine the survival patterns of Salmonella montevideo G4639 on and in tomatoes during storage and the efficacy of chlorine treatment on inactivation of the pathogen. The population of S. montevideo on the surfaces of inoculated tomatoes stored at 10 degrees C did not change significantly (P < 0.05) throughout an 18-day storage period. Significant increases in population occurred within 7 days and within 1 day when tomatoes were stored at 20 and 30 degrees C, respectively. A significantly higher number of cells was taken up by the core tissue of tomatoes tempered at 25 degrees C when the tomatoes were dipped in a suspension at 10 degrees C compared with the number taken up when the tomatoes were dipped in cell suspensions tempered at 25 or 37 degrees C. Populations remained constant throughout subsequent storage for 8 days at 10 degrees C, regardless of the temperature differential between tomatoes and the dip suspension. Storage of tomatoes at 20 degrees C, however, resulted in significant increases in populations of S. montevideo. Populations of the pathogen on the surfaces and in the core tissues of tomatoes were significantly reduced by dipping for 2 min in a solution containing 60 or 110 ppm (60 or 110 micrograms/ml) chlorine, respectively; however, treatment in solution containing 320 ppm chlorine did not result in complete inactivation. Populations of S. montevideo remained unchanged in chopped tomatoes stored at 5 degrees C for 216 h (9 days) but increased significantly after storage for 96 or 22 h at 20 or 30 degrees C, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)	0
Title: Complexes of serine acetyltransferase and isozymes of cysteine synthase in spinach leaves Abstract: Polyclonal antibodies against cysteine synthase (CSase; EC 4.2.99.8) isozymes 1, 2, and 3 were used for the detection of complexes of these isozymes with serine acetyltransferase (SATase; EC 2.3.1.30). SATase was partially purified and found to complex with these isozymes by western blotting and immunotitration. When the complexes were treated with a high concentration of O-acetyl-L-serine, they did not dissociate. However, some complexes with CSase 1 or 3 dissociated when left for 24 h at 4 degrees C. Results of western blotting on SDS-PAGE showed that CSase 2 complexed with SATase. CSases 1, 2, and 3 all could complex with SATase, but the tightness of the bond differed.	0
Title: Characterization and Biosynthesis of a Rare Fungal Hopane-Type Triterpenoid Glycoside Involved in the Antistress Property of Aspergillus fumigatus Abstract: A rare fungal hopane-type triterpenoid glycoside fumihopaside A was identified by genome mining in combination with HPLC-MS/MS in Aspergillus fumigatus. Combining genetic deletions in A. fumigatus with heterologous reconstitutions in Aspergillus nidulans of the afum gene cluster, we identified one fungal squalene hopane cyclase AfumA charging the cyclization of the hopene skeleton, one cytochrome P450, and one UDP-glycosyltransferase. Bioassays indicated that fumihopaside A plays important roles in protecting A. fumigatus against heat or ultraviolet stress.	1
Title: Ca2+-sensitive inactivation of L-type Ca2+ channels depends on multiple cytoplasmic amino acid sequences of the alpha1C subunit Abstract: Ca2+-dependent inactivation of Ca2+ currents is a physiological phenomenon widely associated with L-type Ca2+ channels. Although the pore-forming alpha1C subunit of the channel is the target for Ca2+ binding, the amino acid sequences involved in the binding and/or in the coordination of Ca2+-dependent inactivation are still unclear. Based on previous experiments, we have prepared truncation mutants of a human alpha1C subunit by systematically deleting an EF-hand motif and sequences in a segment of 80 amino acids in the carboxyl-terminal tail. We found that the rate as well as the Ca2+ dependence of inactivation of currents through these mutated channels were very different. We have identified three amino acid sequences, the presence of which is important for Ca2+-dependent inactivation: (i) a putative Ca2+-binding EF-hand motif, (ii) two hydrophilic residues (asparagine and glutamic acid) 77-78 amino acids downstream of the EF-hand motif, and (iii) a putative IQ calmodulin binding motif. We suggest that Ca2+-dependent inactivation is a cooperative process involving several amino acid sequences in cytoplasmic segments of the alpha1C subunit.	0
Title: Classical Microbiological Diagnostics of Bacteremia: Are the Negative Results Really Negative? What is the Laboratory Result Telling Us About the "Gold Standard"? Abstract: Standard blood cultures require at least 24-120 h to be reported as preliminary positive. The objective of this study was to compare the reliability of Gram staining and fluorescent in-situ hybridization (FISH) for detecting bacteria in otherwise negative blood culture bottles. Ninety-six sets were taken from patients with a diagnosis of sepsis. Six incomplete blood culture sets and eight blood cultures sets demonstrating positive growth were excluded. We performed Gram stain and FISH on 82 sets taken from post-operative septic patients: 82 negative aerobic blood cultures, 82 anaerobic blood cultures, and 82 blood samples, as well as 57 blood samples taken from healthy volunteers. From the eighty-two blood sets analyzed from the septic patients, Gram stain visualized bacteria in 62.2% of blood samples, 35.4% of the negative aerobic bottles, and in 31.7% of the negative anaerobic bottles. Utilizing FISH, we detected bacteria in 75.6%, 56.1%, and 64.6% respectively. Among the blood samples from healthy volunteers, FISH detected bacteria in 64.9%, while Gram stain detected bacteria in only 38.6%. The time needed to obtain the study results using Gram stain was 1 h, for FISH 4 h, and for the culture method, considering the duration of growth, 5 days. Gram stain and FISH allow quick detection of bacteria in the blood taken directly from a patient. Finding phagocytosed bacteria, which were also detected among healthy individuals, confirms the hypothesis that blood microbiome exists.	0
Title: Nasopharyngeal carriage and antimicrobial susceptibility of Haemophilus influenzae among children younger than 5 years of age in Beijing, China Abstract: Background:                       Haemophilus influenzae is one of the main pathogens that cause community-acquired respiratory infections in children. Our previous study showed that H. influenzae is the second most common pathogen causing pneumonia and accounts for 30-50% of bacterial meningitis among Chinese children. H. influenzae carriage in children and its resistance to commonly used antimicrobials varies widely both geographically and over time.                  Results:                       Surveys of the nasopharyngeal carriage of H. influenzae in children younger than 5 years of age with acute respiratory tract infection (ARI) were conducted in Beijing Children's Hospital, China in 2000, 2002, 2010, and 2012. The overall annual carriage rates of H. influenzae among children younger than 5 years of age with ARI were 35.5%, 20.6%, 14.4%, and 18.7%, and the percentages of H. influenzae isolates producing β-lactamase were 4%, 13%, 27.1%, and 31%, respectively. The percentages of susceptibility to ampicillin progressively decreased from 96% (2000) to 87% (2002) to 63% (2010) to 61% (2012). All of the ampicillin-resistant isolates were found to be beta-lactamase producers. The susceptibility to tetracycline increased from 54% (2000) to 60% (2002) to 91.5% (2010) to 94.5% (2012). No statistically significant differences were observed in the susceptibility to cefaclor, cefuroxime, sulfamethoxazole, and chloramphenicol. Amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and ceftriaxone were the most effective antimicrobials for the isolates of H. influenzae across the 10-year period.                  Conclusions:                       This report on the H. influenzae carriage rates in children and the susceptibility of these bacteria to commonly used antibiotics showed that H. influenzae carriage decreased from 2000 to 2012. Additionally, the percentage of β-lactamase-producing isolates increased while their susceptibility to ampicillin progressively decreased during this time. These results indicate that the appropriate empirical antimicrobial therapy should be changed for pediatric patients in China.	0
Title: The biosynthetic gene cluster for the antitumor drug bleomycin from Streptomyces verticillus ATCC15003 supporting functional interactions between nonribosomal peptide synthetases and a polyketide synthase Abstract: Background:                       The structural and catalytic similarities between modular nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) and polyketide synthases (PKSs) inspired us to search for a hybrid NRPS-PKS system. The antitumor drug bleomycin (BLM) is a natural hybrid peptide-polyketide metabolite, the biosynthesis of which provides an excellent opportunity to investigate intermodular communication between NRPS and PKS modules. Here, we report the cloning, sequencing, and characterization of the BLM biosynthetic gene cluster from Streptomyces verticillus ATCC15003.                  Results:                       A set of 30 genes clustered with the previously characterized blmAB resistance genes were defined by sequencing a 85-kb contiguous region of DNA from S. verticillus ATCC15003. The sequenced gene cluster consists of 10 NRPS genes encoding nine NRPS modules, a PKS gene encoding one PKS module, five sugar biosynthesis genes, as well as genes encoding other biosynthesis, resistance, and regulatory proteins. The substrate specificities of individual NRPS and PKS modules were predicted based on sequence analysis, and the amino acid specificities of two NRPS modules were confirmed biochemically in vitro. The involvement of the cloned genes in BLM biosynthesis was demonstrated by bioconversion of the BLM aglycones into BLMs in Streptomyces lividans expressing a part of the gene cluster.                  Conclusion:                       The blm gene cluster is characterized by a hybrid NRPS-PKS system, supporting the wisdom of combining individual NRPS and PKS modules for combinatorial biosynthesis. The availability of the blm gene cluster has set the stage for engineering novel BLM analogs by genetic manipulation of genes governing BLM biosynthesis and for investigating the molecular basis for intermodular communication between NRPS and PKS in the biosynthesis of hybrid peptide-polyketide metabolites.	1
Title: A scalable platform to identify fungal secondary metabolites and their gene clusters Abstract: The genomes of filamentous fungi contain up to 90 biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) encoding diverse secondary metabolites-an enormous reservoir of untapped chemical potential. However, the recalcitrant genetics, cryptic expression, and unculturability of these fungi prevent scientists from systematically exploiting these gene clusters and harvesting their products. As heterologous expression of fungal BGCs is largely limited to the expression of single or partial clusters, we established a scalable process for the expression of large numbers of full-length gene clusters, called FAC-MS. Using fungal artificial chromosomes (FACs) and metabolomic scoring (MS), we screened 56 secondary metabolite BGCs from diverse fungal species for expression in Aspergillus nidulans. We discovered 15 new metabolites and assigned them with confidence to their BGCs. Using the FAC-MS platform, we extensively characterized a new macrolactone, valactamide A, and its hybrid nonribosomal peptide synthetase-polyketide synthase (NRPS-PKS). The ability to regularize access to fungal secondary metabolites at an unprecedented scale stands to revitalize drug discovery platforms with renewable sources of natural products.	1
Title: Identification of a hybrid PKS-NRPS required for the biosynthesis of NG-391 in Metarhizium robertsii Abstract: The fungal entomopathogen Metarhizium robertsii (formerly known as M. anisopliae var. anisopliae) is a prolific producer of secondary metabolites of which very little is known at the genetic level. To establish the genetic bases for the biosynthesis of the mutagenic compound NG- 391, we identified a 19,818 kb genomic region harboring the predicted hybrid polyketide synthase-nonribosomal peptide synthetase NGS1, plus five additional ORFs. NGS1 knockouts generated by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation failed to produce detectable levels of NG-391, indicating the involvement of this locus in its biosynthesis. NGS1 deletion mutants had no significant changes in virulence levels against larvae of Spodoptera exigua and in resistance to hydrogen peroxide-generated oxidative stress compared to the wild-type strain. All 6 ORFs were expressed in medium supporting production of NG-391, and NGS1 was expressed during the interaction with the S. exigua host. The use of an NGS1 promoter-GFP reporter fusion showed that during in vitro growth in still broth cultures, NGS1 expression is restricted to the early exponential phase and is affected by M. robertsii cell density.	1
Title: Analysis of the role of the type III effector inventory of Pseudomonas syringae pv. phaseolicola 1448a in interaction with the plant Abstract: In Pseudomonas syringae, the type III secretion system (T3SS) is essential for disease in compatible hosts and for eliciting the hypersensitive response in incompatible hosts. P. syringae pathovars secrete a variable number of type III effectors that form their secretomes. The secretome of Pseudomonas syringae pv. phaseolicola 1448a (Pph1448a) currently includes 22 experimentally validated effectors, one HrpL-regulated candidate for which translocation results have been inconsistent, two translocated candidates for which in planta expression has not been established, one bioinformatically identified candidate, and six candidates that have been experimentally discarded. We analyzed the translocation and/or expression of these and other candidates to complete the Pph1448a effector inventory, bringing this inventory to 27 bona fide effectors, including a new one that does not belong to any of the previously described effector families. We developed a simple process for rapidly making single and double knockout mutants and apply it to the generation of an effector mutant collection that includes single knockouts for the majority of the Pph1448a effector inventory. We also generated two double mutant strains containing effectors with potentially redundant functions and analyzed the virulence of the single and double mutant strains as well as strains expressing each of the effectors from a plasmid. We demonstrate that AvrB4-1 and AvrB4-2, as well as HopW1-1 and HopW1-2, are fully redundant and contribute to virulence in bean plants, thus validating this approach for dissecting the contribution of the Pph1448a type III effector inventory to virulence. We also analyzed the effect that the expression of these four effectors from Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000 (PtoDC3000) has during its interaction with Arabidopsis thaliana, establishing that AvrB4-1, but not the others, determines a restriction of bacterial growth that takes place mostly independently of the salicylic acid (SA)-signaling pathway.	0
Title: Genome-wide identification and characterization of macrolide glycosyltransferases from a marine-derived Bacillus strain and their phylogenetic distribution Abstract: Clarifying glycosyltrasferases (GTs) function is of significance for the development of GT inhibitors as drugs, and the use of GTs to glycodiversify small molecules in the search of drug leads. While many Actinomyces natural-product GTs had been functionally characterized, our understanding towards Bacillus natural-product GTs is so far very limited. Herein, genome-wide identification of macrolide GT genes from marine-derived Bacillus methylotrophicus B-9987 revealed the presence of three macrolide GT genes bmmGT1-3. While bmmGT1 was previously revealed to be involved in the biosynthesis of trans-acyltransferase (AT) polyketides compounds macrolactins (MLNs) and bacillaenes (BAEs), the functions of bmmGT2 and bmmGT3 were probed, demonstrating that they are capable to biochemically catalyze glycosylation of MLNs and BAEs as well but interestingly with different regioselectivity, affording four new MLNs analogs. Notably, further genome mining revealed that the orthologs of these three macrolide GT genes showed a regular distribution in the subtilis- and the cereus-clade Bacillus strains; interestingly, bmmGT1 orthologs only occurred in the subtilis-clade Bacillus, and they were also found in the genomes of Streptomyces strains, suggesting their close phylogenetic relationship. These results provide the first significant insight into the important roles of Bacillus macrolide GTs in the biology of the species.	1
Title: Biosynthesis and Heterologous Production of Vioprolides: Rational Biosynthetic Engineering and Unprecedented 4-Methylazetidinecarboxylic Acid Formation Abstract: Vioprolides are a promising class of anticancer and antifungal lead compounds produced by the myxobacterium Cystobacter violaceus Cb vi35. Previously nothing had been reported about their biosynthesis, including the origin of the unusual 4-methylazetidinecarboxylic acid (MAZ) moiety. We describe the vioprolide biosynthetic gene cluster and solve the production obstacle by expression in three heterologous hosts. Starting from unstable production in the wild type at the single-digit mg L-1 scale, we developed a stable host that eventually allowed for yields of up to half a gram per liter in fermenters. Gene inactivations coupled with isotope feeding studies identified an S-adenosylmethionine (SAM)-dependent enzyme and a methyltransferase as being responsible for the generation of the MAZ building block by a proposed mechanism unprecedented in bacteria. Furthermore, nonnatural vioprolide derivatives were generated via rational genetic engineering.	1
Title: Genome-wide identification of pathogenicity factors of the free-living amoeba Naegleria fowleri Abstract: Background:                       The free-living amoeba Naegleria fowleri is the causative agent of the rapidly progressing and typically fatal primary amoebic meningoencephalitis (PAM) in humans. Despite the devastating nature of this disease, which results in > 97% mortality, knowledge of the pathogenic mechanisms of the amoeba is incomplete. This work presents a comparative proteomic approach based on an experimental model in which the pathogenic potential of N. fowleri trophozoites is influenced by the compositions of different media.                  Results:                       As a scaffold for proteomic analysis, we sequenced the genome and transcriptome of N. fowleri. Since the sequence similarity of the recently published genome of Naegleria gruberi was far lower than the close taxonomic relationship of these species would suggest, a de novo sequencing approach was chosen. After excluding cell regulatory mechanisms originating from different media compositions, we identified 22 proteins with a potential role in the pathogenesis of PAM. Functional annotation of these proteins revealed, that the membrane is the major location where the amoeba exerts its pathogenic potential, possibly involving actin-dependent processes such as intracellular trafficking via vesicles.                  Conclusion:                       This study describes for the first time the 30 Mb-genome and the transcriptome sequence of N. fowleri and provides the basis for the further definition of effective intervention strategies against the rare but highly fatal form of amoebic meningoencephalitis.	0
Title: The role of the G2 box, a conserved motif in the histidine kinase superfamily, in modulating the function of EnvZ Abstract: Histidine kinase EnvZ, a transmembrane osmotic sensor for Escherichia coli, is a bifunctional enzyme having OmpR (its cognate response regulator) kinase and phosphorylated OmpR (OmpR-P) phosphatase activities. Its cytoplasmic domain consists of domain A responsible for dimerization of EnvZ, histidine phosphotransfer and phosphatase activities, and domain B responsible for ATP binding. Here, we have constructed a number of substitution mutations at the G2 box, one of the conserved motifs in domain B, and demonstrated that they influence the phosphatase activity of EnvZ over a wide range. The effects of ADP, a cofactor for the phosphatase activity, were found to be substantially different depending upon the mutations. The effects of these mutations were also examined in vivo using a chimeric Tar-EnvZ construct (Taz1-1), and the results agreed with the in vitro data for the phosphatase and kinase activities for all mutations. Using Taz1-1 carrying the T402A mutation, three independent intragenic suppressor mutations (T235M, S269L and E276K) were isolated, and all were found in domain A. Together, the present results demonstrate for the first time that domain A and domain B are functionally co-ordinated and topologically arranged in a specific manner. The G2 box may modulate the interaction between these two domains in response to extracellular osmolarity.	0
Title: Neothioviridamide, a Polythioamide Compound Produced by Heterologous Expression of a Streptomyces sp. Cryptic RiPP Biosynthetic Gene Cluster Abstract: During genome mining for thioviridamide-like biosynthetic gene clusters that could produce polythioamide RiPP (ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides), we discovered a novel cryptic biosynthetic gene cluster. During efforts to express this biosynthetic gene using heterologous expression of this biosynthetic gene cluster, a novel compound designated as neothioviridamide was produced. We report herein the cloning and heterologous expression of the neothioviridamide biosynthetic gene cluster and the isolation, structure determination, and cytotoxic activity of neothioviridamide.	1
Title: Uncovering biosynthetic relationships between antifungal nonadrides and octadrides Abstract: Maleidrides are a class of bioactive secondary metabolites unique to filamentous fungi, which contain one or more maleic anhydrides fused to a 7-, 8- or 9- membered carbocycle (named heptadrides, octadrides and nonadrides respectively). Herein structural and biosynthetic studies on the antifungal octadride, zopfiellin, and nonadrides scytalidin, deoxyscytalidin and castaneiolide are described. A combination of genome sequencing, bioinformatic analyses, gene disruptions, biotransformations, isotopic feeding studies, NMR and X-ray crystallography revealed that they share a common biosynthetic pathway, diverging only after the nonadride deoxyscytalidin. 5-Hydroxylation of deoxyscytalidin occurs prior to ring contraction in the zopfiellin pathway of Diffractella curvata. In Scytalidium album, 6-hydroxylation - confirmed as being catalysed by the α-ketoglutarate dependent oxidoreductase ScyL2 - converts deoxyscytalidin to scytalidin, in the final step in the scytalidin pathway. Feeding scytalidin to a zopfiellin PKS knockout strain led to the production of the nonadride castaneiolide and two novel ring-open maleidrides.	1
Title: Erythroid-specific expression of beta-globin by the sleeping beauty transposon for Sickle cell disease Abstract: Sickle cell disease (SCD) results predominately from a single monogenic mutation that affects thousands of individuals worldwide. Gene therapy approaches have focused on using viral vectors to transfer wild-type beta- or gamma-globin transgenes into hematopoietic stem cells for long-term expression of the recombinant globins. In this study, we investigated the use of a novel nonviral vector system, the Sleeping Beauty (SB) transposon (Tn) to insert a wild-type beta-globin expression cassette into the human genome for sustained expression of beta-globin. We initially constructed a beta-globin expression vector composed of the hybrid cytomegalovirus (CMV) enhancer chicken beta-actin promoter (CAGGS) and full-length beta-globin cDNA, as well as truncated forms lacking either the 3' or 3' and 5' untranslated regions (UTRs), to optimize expression of beta-globin. Beta-globin with its 5' UTR was efficiently expressed from its cDNA in K-562 cells induced with hemin. However, expression was constitutive and not erythroid-specific. We then constructed cis SB-Tn-beta-globin plasmids using a minimal beta-globin gene driven by hybrid promoter IHK (human ALAS2 intron 8 erythroid-specific enhancer, HS40 core element from human alphaLCR, ankyrin-1 promoter), IHbetap (human ALAS2 intron 8 erythroid-specific enhancer, HS40 core element from human alphaLCR, beta-globin promoter), or HS3betap (HS3 core element from human betaLCR, beta-globin promoter) to establish erythroid-specific expression of beta-globin. Stable genomic insertion of the minimal gene and expression of the beta-globin transgene for >5 months at a level comparable to that of the endogenous gamma-globin gene were achieved using a SB-Tn beta-globin cis construct. Interestingly, erythroid-specific expression of beta-globin driven by IHK was regulated primarily at the translational level, in contrast to post-transcriptional regulation in non-erythroid cells. The SB-Tn system is a promising nonviral vector for efficient genomic insertion conferring stable, persistent erythroid-specific expression of beta-globin.	0
Title: A new cascade halosulfonylation of 1,7-enynes toward 3,4-dihydroquinolin-2(1H)-ones via sulfonyl radical-triggered addition/6-exo-dig cyclization Abstract: A new cascade three-component halosulfonylation of 1,7-enynes for efficient synthesis of densely functionalized 3,4-dihydroquinolin-2(1H)-ones has been established from readily accessible arylsulfonyl hydrazides and NIS (or NBS). The reaction pathway involves in situ-generated sulfonyl radical-triggered α,β-conjugated addition/6-exo-dig cyclization/radical coupling sequence, resulting in continuous multiple bond-forming events including C-S, C-C and C-I (or C-Br) bonds to rapidly build up molecular complexity.	0
Title: Lincosamide synthetase--a unique condensation system combining elements of nonribosomal peptide synthetase and mycothiol metabolism Abstract: In the biosynthesis of lincosamide antibiotics lincomycin and celesticetin, the amino acid and amino sugar units are linked by an amide bond. The respective condensing enzyme lincosamide synthetase (LS) is expected to be an unusual system combining nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) components with so far unknown amino sugar related activities. The biosynthetic gene cluster of celesticetin was sequenced and compared to the lincomycin one revealing putative LS coding ORFs shared in both clusters. Based on a bioassay and production profiles of S. lincolnensis strains with individually deleted putative LS coding genes, the proteins LmbC, D, E, F and V were assigned to LS function. Moreover, the newly recognized N-terminal domain of LmbN (LmbN-CP) was also assigned to LS as a NRPS carrier protein (CP). Surprisingly, the homologous CP coding sequence in celesticetin cluster is part of ccbZ gene adjacent to ccbN, the counterpart of lmbN, suggesting the gene rearrangement, evident also from still active internal translation start in lmbN, and indicating the direction of lincosamide biosynthesis evolution. The in vitro test with LmbN-CP, LmbC and the newly identified S. lincolnensis phosphopantetheinyl transferase Slp, confirmed the cooperation of the previously characterized NRPS A-domain LmbC with a holo-LmbN-CP in activation of a 4-propyl-L-proline precursor of lincomycin. This result completed the functional characterization of LS subunits resembling NRPS initiation module. Two of the four remaining putative LS subunits, LmbE/CcbE and LmbV/CcbV, exhibit low but significant homology to enzymes from the metabolism of mycothiol, the NRPS-independent system processing the amino sugar and amino acid units. The functions of particular LS subunits as well as cooperation of both NRPS-based and NRPS-independent LS blocks are discussed. The described condensing enzyme represents a unique hybrid system with overall composition quite dissimilar to any other known enzyme system.	1
Title: Biosynthetic origin of the rare nitroaryl moiety of the polyketide antibiotic aureothin: involvement of an unprecedented N-oxygenase Abstract: The antibiotic aureothin is a rare natural nitroaromatic compound produced by Streptomyces thioluteus. By labeling experiments, we demonstrate for the first time that p-nitrobenzoate (PNBA) serves as a polyketide synthase starter unit. Cloning, heterologous expression, and inactivation experiments reveal that this unusual primer is synthesized from p-aminobenzoate (PABA) by means of AurF, a novel N-oxygenase.	1
Title: Analysis of specific mutants in the lasalocid gene cluster: evidence for enzymatic catalysis of a disfavoured polyether ring closure Abstract: Lasalocid is a highly atypical polyether ionophoric antibiotic, firstly because it contains a type of aromatic ring normally associated with fungal polyketides, and secondly because the formation of its tetrahydropyran ring appears to contravene Baldwin's rules, which predict the kinetically preferred routes for cyclisation reactions in organic chemistry. The lasalocid biosynthetic gene cluster has been cloned from Streptomyces lasaliensis, and the las locus (73,533 bp) was found to contain seven modular polyketide synthase (PKS) genes, including all the activities necessary for the synthesis of the aromatic moiety. Specific deletion from the gene cluster of the flanking lasC gene, which is predicted to encode a flavin-linked epoxidase, abolished production both of lasalocid and of the minor cometabolite iso-lasalocid without leading to accumulation of an identifiable intermediate; this suggests that oxidative cyclisation to form the polyether rings takes place on the PKS before release of the full-length polyketide product. Meanwhile, a mutant in which the adjacent epoxide hydrolase lasB had been deleted produced iso-lasalocid only. Iso-lasalocid differs from lasalocid in the replacement of the tetrahydropyran ring by a tetrohydrofuran ring and represents the kinetically favoured product of cyclisation. The LasB epoxide hydrolase is therefore directly implicated in control of the stereochemical course of polyether ring formation during lasalocid biosynthesis.	1
Title: Biosynthesis of the Klebsiella oxytoca Pathogenicity Factor Tilivalline: Heterologous Expression, in Vitro Biosynthesis, and Inhibitor Development Abstract: Tilvalline is a pyrrolo[4,2]benzodiazepine derivative produced by the pathobiont Klebsiella oxytoca and is the causative toxin in antibiotic associated hemorrhagic colitis (AAHC). Heterologous expression of the tilivalline biosynthetic gene cluster along with in vitro reconstitution of the respective NRPS (NpsA, ThdA, NpsB) was employed to reveal a nonenzymatic indole incorporation via a spontaneous Friedel-Crafts-like alkylation reaction. Furthermore, the heterologous system was used to generate novel tilivalline derivatives by supplementation of respective anthranilate and indole precursors. Finally, it could be shown that salicylic and acetylsalicylic acid inhibit the biosynthesis of tilivalline in K. oxytoca liquid culture, presumably by blocking the peptidyl carrier protein ThdA, pointing toward a potential application in combination therapy to prevent or alleviate the symptoms of AAHC.	1
Title: Direct measurement of free radical generation following reperfusion of ischemic myocardium Abstract: Electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy was used to directly measure free radical generation in perfused rabbit hearts. Hearts were freeze-clamped at 77 degrees K during control perfusion, after 10 min of normothermic global ischemia (no coronary flow), or following post-ischemic reperfusion with oxygenated perfusate. The spectra of these hearts exhibited three different signals with different power saturation and temperature stability: signal A was isotropic with g = 2.004; signal B was anisotropic with axial symmetry with g parallel = 2.033 and g perpendicular = 2.005; signal C was an isotropic triplet with g = 2.000 and hyperfine splitting an = 24 G (1 G = 0.1 mT). The g values, linewidth, power saturation, and temperature stability of signal A are identical to those of a carbon-centered semiquinone, whereas those of signal B are similar to alkyl peroxyl or superoxide oxygen-centered free radicals; signal C is most likely a nitrogen-centered free radical. In the control heart samples signal A predominated, whereas in ischemic hearts signal A decreased in intensity, and signals B and C became more intense; with reperfusion all three signals markedly increased. Free radical concentrations derived from the intensities of the B and C signals peaked 10 sec after initiation of reflow. At this time the oxygen-centered free radical concentration derived from the intensity of signal B was increased over six times the concentration measured in control hearts and over two times the concentration measured in ischemic hearts. Hypoxic reperfusion did not increase any of the free radical signals over the levels observed during ischemia. These experiments directly demonstrate that reactive oxygen-centered free radicals are generated in hearts during ischemia and that a burst of oxygen radical generation occurs within moments of reperfusion.	0
Title: Drug Discovery of Host CLK1 Inhibitors for Influenza Treatment Abstract: The rapid evolution of influenza virus makes antiviral drugs less effective, which is considered to be a major bottleneck in antiviral therapy. The key proteins in the host cells, which are related with the replication cycle of influenza virus, are regarded as potential drug targets due to their distinct advantage of lack of evolution and drug resistance. Cdc2-like kinase 1 (CLK1) in the host cells is responsible for alternative splicing of the M2 gene of influenza virus during influenza infection and replication. In this study, we carried out baculovirus-mediated expression and purification of CLK1 and established a reliable screening assay for CLK1 inhibitors. After a virtual screening of CLK1 inhibitors was performed, the activities of the selected compounds were evaluated. Finally, several compounds with strong inhibitory activity against CLK1 were discovered and their in vitro anti-influenza virus activities were validated using a cytopathic effect (CPE) reduction assay. The assay results showed that clypearin, corilagin, and pinosylvine were the most potential anti-influenza virus compounds as CLK1 inhibitors among the compounds tested. These findings will provide important information for new drug design and development in influenza treatment, and CLK1 may be a potent drug target for anti-influenza drug screening and discovery.	0
Title: Vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus isolates associated with Inc18-like vanA plasmids in Michigan Abstract: Five of the seven cases of vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (VRSA) infection identified to date have occurred in southeastern Michigan. VRSA isolates from the four most recent cases (all from Michigan) were characterized. The vanA gene was localized to a single plasmid in each VRSA isolate. The pulsed-field gel electrophoresis patterns of chromosomal DNA and the restriction profile of the plasmid demonstrated that the four isolates were unique and differed from the first three VRSA isolates. Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) isolates, all of which were Enterococcus faecalis, were recovered from case patients 4 to 6. Each VRE isolate transferred vancomycin resistance to E. faecalis JH2-2 by conjugation. PCRs for vanA and the Inc18-like plasmid genes traA and repR confirmed the presence of an Inc18-like vanA plasmid in all VRE isolates and transconjugants. An Inc18-like vanA plasmid was identified in the VRSA isolate from case patient 7. These findings suggest a role of Inc18-like plasmids as vanA donors.	0
Title: Competition among Nasal Bacteria Suggests a Role for Siderophore-Mediated Interactions in Shaping the Human Nasal Microbiota Abstract: Resources available in the human nasal cavity are limited. Therefore, to successfully colonize the nasal cavity, bacteria must compete for scarce nutrients. Competition may occur directly through interference (e.g., antibiotics) or indirectly by nutrient sequestration. To investigate the nature of nasal bacterial competition, we performed coculture inhibition assays between nasal Actinobacteria and Staphylococcus spp. We found that isolates of coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) were sensitive to growth inhibition by Actinobacteria but that Staphylococcus aureus isolates were resistant to inhibition. Among Actinobacteria, we observed that Corynebacterium spp. were variable in their ability to inhibit CoNS. We sequenced the genomes of 10 Corynebacterium species isolates, including 3 Corynebacterium propinquum isolates that strongly inhibited CoNS and 7 other Corynebacterium species isolates that only weakly inhibited CoNS. Using a comparative genomics approach, we found that the C. propinquum genomes were enriched in genes for iron acquisition and harbored a biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) for siderophore production, absent in the noninhibitory Corynebacterium species genomes. Using a chrome azurol S assay, we confirmed that C. propinquum produced siderophores. We demonstrated that iron supplementation rescued CoNS from inhibition by C. propinquum, suggesting that inhibition was due to iron restriction through siderophore production. Through comparative metabolomics and molecular networking, we identified the siderophore produced by C. propinquum as dehydroxynocardamine. Finally, we confirmed that the dehydroxynocardamine BGC is expressed in vivo by analyzing human nasal metatranscriptomes from the NIH Human Microbiome Project. Together, our results suggest that bacteria produce siderophores to compete for limited available iron in the nasal cavity and improve their fitness.IMPORTANCE Within the nasal cavity, interference competition through antimicrobial production is prevalent. For instance, nasal Staphylococcus species strains can inhibit the growth of other bacteria through the production of nonribosomal peptides and ribosomally synthesized and posttranslationally modified peptides. In contrast, bacteria engaging in exploitation competition modify the external environment to prevent competitors from growing, usually by hindering access to or depleting essential nutrients. As the nasal cavity is a nutrient-limited environment, we hypothesized that exploitation competition occurs in this system. We determined that Corynebacterium propinquum produces an iron-chelating siderophore, and this iron-sequestering molecule correlates with the ability to inhibit the growth of coagulase-negative staphylococci. Furthermore, we found that the genes required for siderophore production are expressed in vivo Thus, although siderophore production by bacteria is often considered a virulence trait, our work indicates that bacteria may produce siderophores to compete for limited iron in the human nasal cavity.	1
Title: Isolation and characterization of carnocyclin a, a novel circular bacteriocin produced by Carnobacterium maltaromaticum UAL307 Abstract: Carnobacterium maltaromaticum UAL307, isolated from fresh pork, exhibits potent activity against a number of gram-positive organisms, including numerous Listeria species. Three bacteriocins were isolated from culture supernatant, and using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry and Edman sequencing, two of these bacteriocins were identified as piscicolin 126 and carnobacteriocin BM1, both of which have previously been described. The remaining bacteriocin, with a molecular mass of 5,862 Da, could not be sequenced by traditional methods, suggesting that the peptide was either cyclic or N-terminally blocked. This bacteriocin showed remarkable stability over a wide temperature and pH range and was unaffected by a variety of proteases. After digestion with trypsin and alpha-chymotrypsin, the peptide was de novo sequenced by tandem mass spectrometry and a linear sequence deduced, consisting of 60 amino acids. Based on this sequence, the molecular mass was predicted to be 5,880 Da, 18 units higher than the observed molecular mass, which suggested that the peptide has a cyclic structure. Identification of the genetic sequence revealed that this peptide is circular, formed by a covalent linkage between the N and C termini following cleavage of a 4-residue peptide leader sequence. The results of structural studies suggest that the peptide is highly structured in aqueous conditions. This bacteriocin, named carnocyclin A, is the first reported example of a circular bacteriocin produced by Carnobacterium spp.	1
Title: Induction of lateral root structure formation on petunia roots: A novel effect of GMI1000 Ralstonia solanacearum infection impaired in Hrp mutants Abstract: Ralstonia solanacearum is a soilborne plant pathogen that invades its host via roots. As in many gram-negative bacterial plant pathogens, the R. solanacearum Hrp type III secretion system is essential for interactions of the bacterium with plants; however, the related mechanisms involved in disease expression are largely unknown. In this work, we examined the effects of infection by R. solanacearum GMI1000 and Hrp mutants on the root system of petunia plants. Both the wild-type and mutant strains disturbed the petunia root architecture development by inhibiting lateral root elongation and provoking swelling of the root tips. In addition, GMI100 but not the Hrp mutants induced the formation of new root lateral structures (RLS). This ability is shared by other, but not all, R. solanacearum strains tested. Like lateral roots, these new structures arise from divisions of pericycle founder cells which, nevertheless, exhibit an abnormal morphology. These RLS are efficient colonization sites allowing extensive bacterial multiplication. However, they are not required for the bacterial vascular invasion that leads to the systemic spread of the bacterium through the whole plant, indicating that, instead, they might play a role in the rhizosphere-related stages of the R. solanacearum life cycle.	0
Title: A Conformationally Restricted Aza-BODIPY Platform for Stimulus-Responsive Probes with Enhanced Photoacoustic Properties Abstract: Photoacoustic (PA) dyes, which absorb near-infrared (NIR) light to generate an ultrasonic signal, can be detected at centimeter depths in tissues with significantly higher resolution than dyes imaged with fluorescence-based methods. As such, PA agents show great promise as research tools for the study of live-animal disease models. However, the development of activatable PA probes has been hampered by the relative scarcity of appropriate PA-active molecular platforms with properties that can be manipulated in a rational manner. Herein we synthesized and evaluated six modifications to the aza-BODIPY dye platform with respect to their absorbance, fluorescence, and PA properties. We identified a promising conformationally restricted aza-BODIPY (CRaB) scaffold that prioritizes three criteria necessary for the design of stimulus-responsive dyes with optimal ratiometric PA response: absorbance at NIR wavelengths, strong PA intensity, and large Δλ upon interaction with the desired stimulus. Using this scaffold, we synthesized three chemically diverse stimulus-responsive PA probes and demonstrated between 2- and 8-fold improvements in theoretical ratiometric response in vitro. This suggests that improvements in PA parameters are generalizable. Finally, we validated the in vitro turnover of each CRaB PA probe and demonstrated the in vivo potential of the CRaB scaffold by direct comparison to an established hypoxia-responsive probe for the detection of tumor hypoxia.	0
Title: Characterization of the bagremycin biosynthetic gene cluster in Streptomyces sp. Tü 4128 Abstract: Bagremycin A and bagremycin B isolated from Streptomyces sp. Tü 4128 have activities against Gram-positive bacteria, fungi and also have a weak antitumor activity, which make them have great potential for development of novel antibiotics. Here, we report a draft genome 8,424,112 bp in length of S. sp. Tü 4128 by Illumina Hiseq2000, and identify the bagremycins biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) by bioinformatics analysis. The putative bagremycins BGC includes 16 open reading frames (ORFs) with the functions of biosynthesis, resistance and regulation. Disruptions of relative genes and HPLC analysis of bagremycins production demonstrated that not all the genes within the BGC are responsible for the biosynthesis of bagremycins. In addition, the biosynthetic pathways of bagremycins are proposed for deeper inquiries into their intriguing biosynthetic mechanism.	1
Title: Heterologous expression of the atypical tetracycline chelocardin reveals the full set of genes required for its biosynthesis Abstract: Background:                       Chelocardin (CHD) exhibits a broad-spectrum antibiotic activity and showed promising results in a small phase II clinical study conducted on patients with urinary tract infections. Importantly, CHD was shown to be active also against tetracycline-resistant Gram-negative pathogens, which is gaining even more importance in today's antibiotic crisis. We have demonstrated that modifications of CHD through genetic engineering of its producer, the actinomycete Amycolatopsis sulphurea, are not only possible but yielded even more potent antibiotics than CHD itself, like 2-carboxamido-2-deacetyl-chelocardin (CD-CHD), which is currently in preclinical evaluation. A. sulphurea is difficult to genetically manipulate and therefore manipulation of the chd biosynthetic gene cluster in a genetically amenable heterologous host would be of high importance for further drug-discovery efforts.                  Results:                       We report heterologous expression of the CHD biosynthetic gene cluster in the model organism Streptomyces albus del14 strain. Unexpectedly, we found that the originally defined CHD gene cluster fails to provide all genes required for CHD formation, including an additional cyclase and two regulatory genes. Overexpression of the putative pathway-specific streptomyces antibiotic regulatory protein chdB in A. sulphurea resulted in an increase of both, CHD and CD-CHD production. Applying a metabolic-engineering approach, it was also possible to generate the potent CHD analogue, CD-CHD in S. albus. Finally, an additional yield increase was achieved in S. albus del14 by in-trans overexpression of the chdR exporter gene, which provides resistance to CHD and CDCHD.                  Conclusions:                       We identified previously unknown genes in the CHD cluster, which were shown to be essential for chelocardin biosynthesis by expression of the full biosynthetic gene cluster in S. albus as heterologous host. When comparing to oxytetracycline biosynthesis, we observed that the CHD gene cluster contains additional enzymes not found in gene clusters encoding the biosynthesis of typical tetracyclines (such as oxytetracycline). This finding probably explains the different chemistries and modes of action, which make CHD/CD-CHD valuable lead structures for clinical candidates. Even though the CHD genes are derived from a rare actinomycete A. sulphurea, the yield of CHD in the heterologous host was very good. The corrected nucleotide sequence of the CHD gene cluster now contains all gene products required for the production of CHD in a genetically amenable heterologous host, thus opening new possibilities towards production of novel and potent tetracycline analogues with a new mode of action.	1
Title: In vitro reconstitution of the myxochelin biosynthetic machinery of Stigmatella aurantiaca Sg a15: Biochemical characterization of a reductive release mechanism from nonribosomal peptide synthetases Abstract: Microorganisms produce iron-chelating compounds to sequester the iron essential for growth from the environment. Many of these compounds are biosynthesized by nonribosomal peptide synthetases, some in cooperation with polyketide synthases. Myxochelins are produced by the myxobacterium Stigmatella aurantiaca Sg a15, and the corresponding gene cluster was cloned recently. We have undertaken to express heterologously the myxochelin biosynthetic machinery in Escherichia coli. To activate the involved proteins posttranslationally, they were coexpressed with the phosphopantetheinyltransferase MtaA from the myxothiazol biosynthetic gene cluster. Phosphopantetheinylation of the carrier proteins could be verified by protein mass analysis. Six active domains in proteins MxcE, MxcF, and MxcG are capable of assembling myxochelin from ATP, NAD(P)H, lysine, and 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid in vitro. This fact demonstrates that the condensation domain of MxcG performs two condensation reactions, creating the aryl-capped alpha-amide and the aryl-capped gamma-amide of the molecule. A previously unknown type of reductive release is performed by the reduction domain of MxcG, which alternatively uses NADPH and NADH to set free the peptidyl-carrier protein-bound thioester as an aldehyde and further reduces it to the alcohol structure that can be found in myxochelin A. This type of reductive release seems to be a general mechanism in polyketide and nonribosomal peptide biosynthesis, because several systems with C-terminal similarity to the reductase domain of MxcG can be found in the databases. Alternatively, the aldehyde can be transaminated, giving rise to a terminal amine.	1
Title: Nucleotide sequence analysis of a gene cloned from Leptospira biflexa serovar patoc which complements an argE defect in Escherichia coli Abstract: The genus Leptospira, as a member of the order Spirochaetales, forms one of the most ancient evolutionary branches of the eubacteria. These spirochetes are morphologically and physiologically different from most eubacteria, and little is known about Leptospira genetics. In this communication, we report the first nucleotide sequence of a Leptospira gene. A gene which complements an argE mutation in Escherichia coli was isolated from a plasmid-based genomic library composed of Leptospira biflexa serovar patoc DNA. The functional region for the complementing activity was localized by transposon mutagenesis and restriction enzyme mapping and by subcloning. Nucleotide sequence analysis indicated a single open reading frame within the region containing argE complementing activity. The size of the predicted protein, 31,071 daltons, was in excellent agreement with data obtained from coupled transcription-translation reactions primed with cloned L. biflexa DNA. One surprising result was that the predicted amino acid sequence of this protein closely resembles portions of the beta' subunits of RNA polymerases from bacteria and chloroplasts.	0
Title: A biosynthetic gene cluster for the acetyl-CoA carboxylase inhibitor andrimid Abstract: Increasing bacterial resistance to antibiotics with conventional targets has focused attention on antibiotics with unconventional targets. One promising candidate, the acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) inhibitor andrimid, is a potent, broad-spectrum antibiotic with high selectivity for prokaryotic ACC. Here, we report the use of a DNA-based approach to clone the andrimid biosynthetic gene cluster from Pantoea agglomerans, yielding a cosmid that confers robust andrimid production on Escherichia coli. This gene cluster encodes a hybrid nonribosomal peptide/polyketide (NRP/PK) synthase with several unusual features, including three enzymes that form and insert beta-phenylalanine, two transglutaminase-like enzymes that likely serve as condensation catalysts, and four densely hybrid modules that form the succinimide precursor. Unlike most type I NRPSs and PKSs, the andrimid gene cluster is a dissociated system comprised of small proteins. Therefore, future efforts can exploit the genetic manipulability of E. coli to engineer the andrimid synthase with the goal of producing a diverse set of andrimid analogues for clinical evaluation.	1
Title: Generation of tetramycin B derivative with improved pharmacological property based on pathway engineering Abstract: Polyene antibiotics, including amphotericin, nystatin, pimaricin, and tetramycin, are important antifungal agents. Increasing the production of polyenes and generation of their improved analogues based on the biosynthetic pathway engineering has aroused wide concern in application researches. Herein, tetramycin and nystatin, both of which share most of acyl-CoA precursors, are produced by Streptomyces hygrospinosus var. beijingensis CGMCC 4.1123. Thus, the intracellular malonyl-CoA is found to be insufficient for PKSs (polyketide synthases) extension of tetramycin by quantitative analysis in this wild-type strain. To circumvent this problem and increase tetramycin titer, the acyl-CoA competing biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) of nystatin was disrupted, and the biosynthetic genes of malonyl-CoA from S. coelicolor M145 were integrated and overexpressed in nys-disruption mutant strain (SY02). Moreover, in order to specifically accumulate tetramycin B from A, two copies of tetrK and a copy of tetrF were introduced, resulting in elevating tetramycin B fermentration titer by 122% to 865 ± 8 mg/L than the wild type. In this optimized strain, a new tetramycin derivative, 12-decarboxy-12-methyl tetramycin B, was generated with a titer of 371 ± 26 mg/L through inactivation of a P450 monooxygenase gene tetrG. Compared with tetramycin B, the new compound exhibited higher antifungal activity against Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Rhodotorula glutinis, but lower hemolytic toxicity to erythrocyte. This research provided a good example of employing biosynthetic engineering strategies for fermentation titer improvement of polyene and development of the derivatives for medicinal applications.	1
Title: Anthranilate-activating modules from fungal nonribosomal peptide assembly lines Abstract: Fungal natural products containing benzodiazepinone- and quinazolinone-fused ring systems can be assembled by nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPS) using the conformationally restricted beta-amino acid anthranilate as one of the key building blocks. We validated that the first module of the acetylaszonalenin synthetase of Neosartorya fischeri NRRL 181 activates anthranilate to anthranilyl-AMP. With this as a starting point, we then used bioinformatic predictions about fungal adenylation domain selectivities to identify and confirm an anthranilate-activating module in the fumiquinazoline A producer Aspergillus fumigatus Af293 as well as a second anthranilate-activating NRPS in N. fischeri. This establishes an anthranilate adenylation domain code for fungal NRPS and should facilitate detection and cloning of gene clusters for benzodiazepine- and quinazoline-containing polycyclic alkaloids with a wide range of biological activities.	1
Title: Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) lacks a genomic island present in the chromosome of Streptomyces lividans 66 Abstract: Streptomyces lividans ZX1 has become a preferred host for DNA cloning in Streptomyces species over its progenitor, the wild-type strain 66 (stock number 1326 from the John Innes Center collection), especially when stable DNA is crucial for in vitro electrophoresis, because DNA from strain 66 contains a novel modification that makes it sensitive to oxidative double-strand cleavage during electrophoresis. Detailed analysis of this modification-deficient mutant (ZX1) revealed that it has several additional phenotypic traits associated with a chromosomal deletion of ca. 90 kb, which was cloned and mapped by using a cosmid library. Comparative sequence analysis of two clones containing the left and right deletion ends originating from strain 66 and one clone with the deletion and fused sequence cloned from strain ZX1 revealed a perfect 15-bp direct repeat, which may have mediated deletion and fusion to yield strain ZX1 by site-specific recombination. Analysis of AseI linking clones in the deleted region in relation to the published AseI map of strain ZX1 yielded a complete AseI map for the S. lividans 66 genome, on which the relative positions of a cloned phage phiHAU3 resistance (phiHAU3r) gene and the dnd gene cluster were precisely localized. Comparison of S. lividans ZX1 and its progenitor 66, as well as the sequenced genome of its close relative, Streptomyces coelicolor M145, reveals that the ca. 90-kb deletion in strain ZX1 may have originated from an insertion from an unknown source.	0
Title: In vitro synergistic activity of ethambutol, isoniazid, kanamycin, rifampin, and streptomycin against Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare complex Abstract: Strains of Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare complex often exhibit in vitro resistance to common antimycobacterial agents. Combinations of etambutol, isoniazid, kanamycin, rifampin, and streptomycin were tested to determine if synergism occurred. Ninety-six percent of the strains were susceptible to a combination of ethambutol and rifampin at concentrations attainable clinically. Other combinations of antimycobacterial agents inhibited 4 to 82% of the isolates tested.	0
Title: The murein hydrolase of the bacteriophage phi3626 dual lysis system is active against all tested Clostridium perfringens strains Abstract: Clostridium perfringens commonly occurs in food and feed, can produce an enterotoxin frequently implicated in food-borne disease, and has a substantial negative impact on the poultry industry. As a step towards new approaches for control of this organism, we investigated the cell wall lysis system of C. perfringens bacteriophage phi3626, whose dual lysis gene cassette consists of a holin gene and an endolysin gene. Hol3626 has two membrane-spanning domains (MSDs) and is a group II holin. A positively charged beta turn between the two MSDs suggests that both the amino terminus and the carboxy terminus of Hol3626 might be located outside the cell membrane, a very unusual holin topology. Holin function was experimentally demonstrated by using the ability of the holin to complement a deletion of the heterologous phage lambda S holin in lambdadeltaSthf. The endolysin gene ply3626 was cloned in Escherichia coli. However, protein synthesis occurred only when bacteria were supplemented with rare tRNA(Arg) and tRNA(Ile) genes. Formation of inclusion bodies could be avoided by drastically lowering the expression level. Amino-terminal modification by a six-histidine tag did not affect enzyme activity and enabled purification by metal chelate affinity chromatography. Ply3626 has an N-terminal amidase domain and a unique C-terminal portion, which might be responsible for the specific lytic range of the enzyme. All 48 tested strains of C. perfringens were sensitive to the murein hydrolase, whereas other clostridia and bacteria belonging to other genera were generally not affected. This highly specific activity towards C. perfringens might be useful for novel biocontrol measures in food, feed, and complex microbial communities.	0
Title: CYP76M7 is an ent-cassadiene C11alpha-hydroxylase defining a second multifunctional diterpenoid biosynthetic gene cluster in rice Abstract: Biosynthetic gene clusters are common in microbial organisms, but rare in plants, raising questions regarding the evolutionary forces that drive their assembly in multicellular eukaryotes. Here, we characterize the biochemical function of a rice (Oryza sativa) cytochrome P450 monooxygenase, CYP76M7, which seems to act in the production of antifungal phytocassanes and defines a second diterpenoid biosynthetic gene cluster in rice. This cluster is uniquely multifunctional, containing enzymatic genes involved in the production of two distinct sets of phytoalexins, the antifungal phytocassanes and antibacterial oryzalides/oryzadiones, with the corresponding genes being subject to distinct transcriptional regulation. The lack of uniform coregulation of the genes within this multifunctional cluster suggests that this was not a primary driving force in its assembly. However, the cluster is dedicated to specialized metabolism, as all genes in the cluster are involved in phytoalexin metabolism. We hypothesize that this dedication to specialized metabolism led to the assembly of the corresponding biosynthetic gene cluster. Consistent with this hypothesis, molecular phylogenetic comparison demonstrates that the two rice diterpenoid biosynthetic gene clusters have undergone independent elaboration to their present-day forms, indicating continued evolutionary pressure for coclustering of enzymatic genes encoding components of related biosynthetic pathways.	1
Title: Molecular characterization of the safracin biosynthetic pathway from Pseudomonas fluorescens A2-2: designing new cytotoxic compounds Abstract: Safracin is an antibiotic with anti-tumour activity produced by Pseudomonas fluorescens A2-2. The entire safracin synthetic gene cluster spanning 17.5 kb has been identified, cloned and sequenced. The safracin cluster comprises 10 open reading frames (ORFs) encoding proteins for three non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPS), three safracin precursor biosynthetic enzymes, two safracin tailoring enzymes, a safracin resistance protein and a small hypothetical protein of unknown function. These genes are organized in two divergent operons of eight and two genes respectively. This pathway exhibits unusual features when compared with other NRPS systems. We have demonstrated by heterologous expression of the cluster that it is able to direct the synthesis of safracin in other strains. Cross-feeding experiments have confirmed that 3-hydroxy-5-methyl-O-methyltyrosine is the precursor of two amino acids of the molecule. Genetic analyses have allowed us to demonstrate that the bicistronic operon encodes the hydroxylation and N-methylation activities of the pathway. The cloning and expression of the safracin cluster has settled the basis for the in vivo and in vitro production of a wide variety of compounds, such as the promising ecteinascidins anti-cancer compounds.	1
Title: Discovery of a Cell-Active SuTEx Ligand of Prostaglandin Reductase 2 Abstract: Sulfonyl-triazoles have emerged as a new reactive group for covalent modification of tyrosine sites on proteins through sulfur-triazole exchange (SuTEx) chemistry. The extent to which this sulfur electrophile can be tuned for developing ligands with cellular activity remains largely underexplored. Here, we performed fragment-based ligand discovery in live cells to identify SuTEx compounds capable of liganding tyrosine sites on diverse protein targets. We verified our quantitative chemical proteomic findings by demonstrating concentration-dependent activity of SuTEx ligands, but not inactive counterparts, against recombinant protein targets directly in live cells. Our structure-activity relationship studies identified the SuTEx ligand HHS-0701 as a cell-active inhibitor capable of blocking prostaglandin reductase 2 (PTGR2) biochemical activity.	0
Title: Characterization of a sugar-O-methyltransferase TiaS5 affords new Tiacumicin analogues with improved antibacterial properties and reveals substrate promiscuity Abstract: The 18-membered macrocyclic glycoside tiacumicin B, an RNA polymerase inhibitor, is of great therapeutic significance in treating Clostridium difficile infections. The recent characterization of the tiacumicin B biosynthetic gene cluster from Dactylosporangium aurantiacum subsp. hamdenensis NRRL 18085 revealed the functions of two glycosyltransferases, a C-methyltransferase, an acyltransferase, two cytochrome P450s, and a tailoring dihalogenase in tiacumicin biosynthesis. Here we report the genetic confirmation and biochemical characterization of TiaS5 as a sugar-O-methyltransferase, requisite for tiacumicin B biosynthesis. The tiaS5-inactivation mutant is capable of producing 14 tiacumicin analogues (11 of which are new), all lacking the 2'-O-methyl group on the internal rhamnose moiety. Notably, two tiacumicin analogues exhibit improved antibacterial properties. We have also biochemically verified TiaS5 as an S-adenosyl-L-methionine-dependent O-methyltransferase, requiring divalent metal ions for activity. Substrate probing revealed TiaS5 to be a promiscuous enzyme, recognizing 12 tiacumicin analogues. These findings unequivocally establish that TiaS5 functions as a 2'-O-methyltransferase and provide direct biochemical evidence that TiaS5-catalyzed methylation is a tailoring step after glycosyl coupling in tiacumicin B biosynthesis.	1
Title: The dnaK protein of Escherichia coli possesses an ATPase and autophosphorylating activity and is essential in an in vitro DNA replication system Abstract: The Escherichia coli dnaK gene product, originally defined by mutations that blocked lambda phage DNA replication, is known to be necessary for E. coli viability. We have purified dnaK protein to homogeneity and have demonstrated that it possesses a weak DNA-independent ATPase activity, which results in the production of ADP and Pi. The proof that this ATPase activity is encoded by the dnaK+ gene relies primarily on the fact that the dnaK756 mutation results in the production of an ATPase activity with altered physical properties. The dnaK protein is phosphorylated in vitro and in vivo, probably as a result of an autophosphorylation reaction. The lambda O and P replication proteins were shown to interact in vitro with the dnaK protein. The ATPase activity of the dnaK protein was inhibited by purified lambda P protein and stimulated by purified lambda O protein. Moreover, the dnaK protein participates in the initiation of DNA synthesis in an in vitro DNA replication system that is dependent on the O and P proteins. Anti-dnaK protein immunoglobulin specifically inhibited DNA synthesis in this system.	0
Title: Fungal Isocyanide Synthases and Xanthocillin Biosynthesis in Aspergillus fumigatus Abstract: Microbial secondary metabolites, including isocyanide moieties, have been extensively mined for their repertoire of bioactive properties. Although the first naturally occurring isocyanide (xanthocillin) was isolated from the fungus Penicillium notatum over half a century ago, the biosynthetic origins of fungal isocyanides remain unknown. Here we report the identification of a family of isocyanide synthases (ICSs) from the opportunistic human pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus Comparative metabolomics of overexpression or knockout mutants of ICS candidate genes led to the discovery of a fungal biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) that produces xanthocillin (xan). Detailed analysis of xanthocillin biosynthesis in A. fumigatus revealed several previously undescribed compounds produced by the xan BGC, including two novel members of the melanocin family of compounds. We found both the xan BGC and a second ICS-containing cluster, named the copper-responsive metabolite (crm) BGC, to be transcriptionally responsive to external copper levels and further demonstrated that production of metabolites from the xan BGC is increased during copper starvation. The crm BGC includes a novel type of fungus-specific ICS-nonribosomal peptide synthase (NRPS) hybrid enzyme, CrmA. This family of ICS-NRPS hybrid enzymes is highly enriched in fungal pathogens of humans, insects, and plants. Phylogenetic assessment of all ICSs spanning the tree of life shows not only high prevalence throughout the fungal kingdom but also distribution in species not previously known to harbor BGCs, indicating an untapped resource of fungal secondary metabolism.IMPORTANCE Fungal ICSs are an untapped resource in fungal natural product research. Their isocyanide products have been implicated in plant and insect pathogenesis due to their ability to coordinate transition metals and disable host metalloenzymes. The discovery of a novel isocyanide-producing family of hybrid ICS-NRPS enzymes enriched in medically and agriculturally important fungal pathogens may reveal mechanisms underlying pathogenicity and afford opportunities to discover additional families of isocyanides. Furthermore, the identification of noncanonical ICS BGCs will enable refinement of BGC prediction algorithms to expand on the secondary metabolic potential of fungal and bacterial species. The identification of genes related to ICS BGCs in fungal species not previously known for secondary metabolite-producing capabilities (e.g., Saccharomyces spp.) contributes to our understanding of the evolution of BGC in fungi.	1
Title: Discovery of Unusual Cyanobacterial Tryptophan-Containing Anabaenopeptins by MS/MS-Based Molecular Networking Abstract: Heterocytous cyanobacteria are among the most prolific sources of bioactive secondary metabolites, including anabaenopeptins (APTs). A terrestrial filamentous Brasilonema sp. CT11 collected in Costa Rica bamboo forest as a black mat, was studied using a multidisciplinary approach: genome mining and HPLC-HRMS/MS coupled with bioinformatic analyses. Herein, we report the nearly complete genome consisting of 8.79 Mbp with a GC content of 42.4%. Moreover, we report on three novel tryptophan-containing APTs; anabaenopeptin 788 (1), anabaenopeptin 802 (2), and anabaenopeptin 816 (3). Furthermore, the structure of two homologues, i.e., anabaenopeptin 802 (2a) and anabaenopeptin 802 (2b), was determined by spectroscopic analysis (NMR and MS). Both compounds were shown to exert weak to moderate antiproliferative activity against HeLa cell lines. This study also provides the unique and diverse potential of biosynthetic gene clusters and an assessment of the predicted chemical space yet to be discovered from this genus.	1
Title: Molecular epidemiology of macrolide and tetracycline resistances in commensal Gemella sp. isolates Abstract: The epidemiologic relatedness of 29 erythromycin-resistant Gemella sp. strains from normal flora, characterized previously, were evaluated by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Three isolates carried the tet(O) gene and the tet(M) gene. The msr(A) gene was found in two Gemella morbillorum strains in combination with the erm(B) or mef(E) gene. The sequences of the mef(A/E), erm(B), and msr(A) genes showed a high similarity to the corresponding sequences of other gram-positive cocci. All the strains harboring the mef(A/E) gene and the msr(D) gene possessed open reading frame 3 (ORF3)/ORF6. The 16 G. morbillorum isolates represented 15 distinct DNA profiles. Four clusters were identified (>or=80% genetic relatedness). The 12 Gemella haemolysans strains belonged to different PFGE types. The clonal diversity found suggests that horizontal transfer may be the main route through which erythromycin resistance is acquired.	0
Title: Esterase-Sensitive Prodrugs with Tunable Release Rates and Direct Generation of Hydrogen Sulfide Abstract: Prodrugs that release hydrogen sulfide upon esterase-mediated cleavage of an ester group followed by lactonization are described herein. By modifying the ester group and thus its susceptibility to esterase, and structural features critical to the lactonization rate, H2 S release rates can be tuned. Such prodrugs directly release hydrogen sulfide without the involvement of perthiol species, which are commonly encountered with existing H2 S donors. Additionally, such prodrugs can easily be conjugated to another non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent, leading to easy synthesis of hybrid prodrugs. As a biological validation of the H2 S prodrugs, the anti-inflammatory effects of one such prodrug were examined by studying its ability to inhibit LPS-induced TNF-α production in RAW 264.7 cells. This type of H2 S prodrugs shows great potential as both research tools and therapeutic agents.	0
Title: Functional expression of the ectoine hydroxylase gene (thpD) from Streptomyces chrysomallus in Halomonas elongata Abstract: The formation of hydroxyectoine in the industrial ectoine producer Halomonas elongata was improved by the heterologous expression of the ectoine hydroxylase gene, thpD, from Streptomyces chrysomallus. The efficient conversion of ectoine to hydroxyectoine was achieved by the concerted regulation of thpD by the H. elongata ectA promoter.	1
Title: Plantazolicin, a novel microcin B17/streptolysin S-like natural product from Bacillus amyloliquefaciens FZB42 Abstract: Here we report on a novel thiazole/oxazole-modified microcin (TOMM) from Bacillus amyloliquefaciens FZB42, a Gram-positive soil bacterium. This organism is well known for stimulating plant growth and biosynthesizing complex small molecules that suppress the growth of bacterial and fungal plant pathogens. Like microcin B17 and streptolysin S, the TOMM from B. amyloliquefaciens FZB42 undergoes extensive posttranslational modification to become a bioactive natural product. Our data show that the modified peptide bears a molecular mass of 1,335 Da and displays antibacterial activity toward closely related Gram-positive bacteria. A cluster of 12 genes that covers ∼10 kb is essential for the production, modification, export, and self-immunity of this natural product. We have named this compound plantazolicin (PZN), based on the association of several producing organisms with plants and the incorporation of azole heterocycles, which derive from Cys, Ser, and Thr residues of the precursor peptide.	1
Title: Identification of a polyketide synthase coding sequence specific for anatoxin-a-producing Oscillatoria cyanobacteria Abstract: We report the identification of a sequence from the genome of Oscillatoria sp. strain PCC 6506 coding for a polyketide synthase. Using 50 axenic cyanobacteria, we found this sequence only in the genomes of Oscillatoria strains producing anatoxin-a or homoanatoxin-a, indicating its likely involvement in the biosynthesis of these toxins.	1
Title: Native and Engineered Clifednamide Biosynthesis in Multiple Streptomyces spp Abstract: Polycyclic tetramate macrolactam (PTM) natural products are produced by actinomycetes and other bacteria. PTMs are often bioactive, and the simplicity of their biosynthetic clusters make them attractive for bioengineering. Clifednamide-type PTMs from Streptomyces sp. strain JV178 contain a distinctive ketone group, suggesting the existence of a novel PTM oxidizing enzyme. Here, we report the new cytochrome P450 enzyme (CftA) is required for clifednamide production. Genome mining was used to identify several new clifednamide producers, some having improved clifednamide yields. Using a parallel synthetic biology approach, CftA isozymes were used to engineer the ikarugamycin pathway of Streptomyces sp. strain NRRL F-2890 to yield clifednamides. Further, we observed that strong CftA expression leads to the production of a new PTM, clifednamide C. We demonstrate the utility of both genome mining and synthetic biology to rapidly increase clifednamide production.	1
Title: Late stage oxidations during the biosynthesis of the 2-pyridone tenellin in the entomopathogenic fungus Beauveria bassiana Abstract: Late stage oxidations during the biosynthesis of the 2-pyridone tenellin in the insect pathogenic fungus Beauveria bassiana were investigated by a combination of gene knockout, antisense RNA, and gene coexpression studies. Open reading frames (ORF) 3 and 4 of the tenellin biosynthetic gene cluster were previously shown to encode a trans-acting enoyl reductase and a hybrid polyketide synthase nonribosomal peptide synthetase (PKS-NRPS), respectively, which together synthesize the acyltetramic acid pretenellin-A. In this work, we have shown that ORF1 encodes a cytochrome P450 oxidase, which catalyzes an unprecedented oxidative ring expansion of pretenellin-A to form the 2-pyridone core of tenellin and related metabolites, and that this enzyme does not catalyze the formation of a hydroxylated precursor. Similar genes appear to be associated with PKS-NRPS genes in other fungi. ORF2 encodes an unusual cytochrome P450 monooxygenase required for the selective N-hydroxylation of the 2-pyridone which is incapable of N-hydroxylation of acyltetramic acids.	1
Title: A comparison of the production of ethanol between simultaneous saccharification and fermentation and separate hydrolysis and fermentation using unpretreated cassava pulp and enzyme cocktail Abstract: The processes of separate hydrolysis and fermentation (SHF) and simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) were employed using Saccharomyces cerevisiae for the production of ethanol from cassava pulp without any pretreatment. A combination of amylase, cellulase, cellobiase, and glucoamylase produced the highest levels of ethanol production in both the SHF and the SSF method. A temperature of 37 °C, a pH of 5.0, and an inoculum size of 6% were the optimum conditions for SSF. For the batch process at a pulp concentration of 20%, ethanol production levels from SHF and SSF were the highest, at 23.51 and 34.67 g L(-1) respectively, but in the fed-batch process, the levels of ethanol production from SHF and SSF rose to 29.39 and 43.25 g L(-1) respectively, which were 25% and 24.7% higher than those of the batch process. Thus SSF using the fed-batch provided a more efficient method for the utilization of cassava pulp.	0
Title: Identification and manipulation of the pleuromutilin gene cluster from Clitopilus passeckerianus for increased rapid antibiotic production Abstract: Semi-synthetic derivatives of the tricyclic diterpene antibiotic pleuromutilin from the basidiomycete Clitopilus passeckerianus are important in combatting bacterial infections in human and veterinary medicine. These compounds belong to the only new class of antibiotics for human applications, with novel mode of action and lack of cross-resistance, representing a class with great potential. Basidiomycete fungi, being dikaryotic, are not generally amenable to strain improvement. We report identification of the seven-gene pleuromutilin gene cluster and verify that using various targeted approaches aimed at increasing antibiotic production in C. passeckerianus, no improvement in yield was achieved. The seven-gene pleuromutilin cluster was reconstructed within Aspergillus oryzae giving production of pleuromutilin in an ascomycete, with a significant increase (2106%) in production. This is the first gene cluster from a basidiomycete to be successfully expressed in an ascomycete, and paves the way for the exploitation of a metabolically rich but traditionally overlooked group of fungi.	1
Title: Gene cluster involved in the biosynthesis of griseobactin, a catechol-peptide siderophore of Streptomyces sp. ATCC 700974 Abstract: The main siderophores produced by streptomycetes are desferrioxamines. Here we show that Streptomyces sp. ATCC 700974 and several Streptomyces griseus strains, in addition, synthesize a hitherto unknown siderophore with a catechol-peptide structure, named griseobactin. The production is repressed by iron. We sequenced a 26-kb DNA region comprising a siderophore biosynthetic gene cluster encoding proteins similar to DhbABCEFG, which are involved in the biosynthesis of 2,3-dihydroxybenzoate (DHBA) and in the incorporation of DHBA into siderophores via a nonribosomal peptide synthetase. Adjacent to the biosynthesis genes are genes that encode proteins for the secretion, uptake, and degradation of siderophores. To correlate the gene cluster with griseobactin synthesis, the dhb genes in ATCC 700974 were disrupted. The resulting mutants no longer synthesized DHBA and griseobactin; production of both was restored by complementation with the dhb genes. Heterologous expression of the dhb genes or of the entire griseobactin biosynthesis gene cluster in the catechol-negative strain Streptomyces lividans TK23 resulted in the synthesis and secretion of DHBA or griseobactin, respectively, suggesting that these genes are sufficient for DHBA and griseobactin biosynthesis. Griseobactin was purified and characterized; its structure is consistent with a cyclic and, to a lesser extent, linear form of the trimeric ester of 2,3-dihydroxybenzoyl-arginyl-threonine complexed with aluminum under iron-limiting conditions. This is the first report identifying the gene cluster for the biosynthesis of DHBA and a catechol siderophore in Streptomyces.	1
Title: Versatile Interacting Peptide (VIP) Tags for Labeling Proteins with Bright Chemical Reporters Abstract: Fluorescence microscopy is an essential tool for the biosciences, enabling the direct observation of proteins in their cellular environment. New methods that facilitate attachment of photostable synthetic fluorophores with genetic specificity are needed to advance the frontiers of biological imaging. Here, we describe a new set of small, selective, genetically encoded tags for proteins based on a heterodimeric coiled-coil interaction between two peptides: CoilY and CoilZ. Proteins expressed as a fusion to CoilZ were selectively labeled with the complementary CoilY fluorescent probe peptide. Fluorophore-labeled target proteins were readily detected in cell lysates with high specificity and sensitivity. We found that these versatile interacting peptide (VIP) tags allowed rapid and specific delivery of bright organic dyes or quantum dots to proteins displayed on living cells. Additionally, we validated that either CoilY or CoilZ could serve as the VIP tag, which enabled us to observe two distinct cell-surface protein targets with this one heterodimeric pair.	0
Title: Expression and DNA binding activity of the tomato transcription factor RIN (ripening inhibitor) Abstract: Recently, we have found that the accumulation of ripening inhibitor (RIN) protein increased gradually during tomato fruit ripening. Here, the recombinant protein was expressed in Escherichia coli and affinity-purified. The DNA binding activity of renatured RIN protein was tested by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. The results indicated that an optimal expression and purification system was suitable for obtaining active RIN with DNA binding activity.	0
Title: Identification of mokB involved in monacolin K biosynthesis in Monascus pilosus Abstract: Monacolin K (MK), which is widely used as an antihypercholesterolemia medicine, is produced as a fungal secondary metabolite through the polyketide pathway. The MK biosynthetic gene cluster proposed for Monascus pilosus BCRC38072 was also identified in M. pilosus NBRC4480. The mokB gene, located at the end of the putative gene cluster and possibly encoding polyketide synthase, was disrupted. The mokB disruptant did not produce MK, but accumulated an intermediate that was confirmed to be monacolin J, indicating that mokB encodes the polyketide synthase responsible for the biosynthesis of side-chain diketide moiety.	1
Title: Agrobacterium bioassay strain for ultrasensitive detection of N-acylhomoserine lactone-type quorum-sensing molecules: detection of autoinducers in Mesorhizobium huakuii Abstract: An ultrasensitive bioassay system for the detection of N-acylhomoserine lactones (AHLs) was constructed in Agrobacterium tumefaciens by using the T7 expression system to overproduce the AHL receptor TraR. This strain detected many diverse AHLs, some at extremely low concentrations. We used this strain to detect for the first time AHLs made by Mesorhizobium huakuii, which symbiotically fixes nitrogen in association with the legume Astragalus sinicus, a source of green manure throughout eastern Asia.	0
Title: The Intersection of Structural and Chemical Biology - An Essential Synergy Abstract: The continual improvement in our ability to generate high resolution structural models of biological molecules has stimulated and supported innovative chemical biology projects that target increasingly challenging ligand interaction sites. In this review we outline some of the recent developments in chemical biology and rational ligand design and show selected examples that illustrate the synergy between these research areas.	0
Title: Exploiting the mosaic structure of trans-acyltransferase polyketide synthases for natural product discovery and pathway dissection Abstract: Modular polyketide synthases (PKSs) are giant bacterial enzymes that synthesize many polyketides of therapeutic value. In contrast to PKSs that provide acyltransferase (AT) activities in cis, trans-AT PKSs lack integrated AT domains and exhibit unusual enzymatic features with poorly understood functions in polyketide assembly. This has retarded insight into the assembly of products such as mupirocin, leinamycin and bryostatin 1. We show that trans-AT PKSs evolved in a fundamentally different fashion from cis-AT systems, through horizontal recruitment and assembly of substrate-specific ketosynthase (KS) domains. The insights obtained from analysis of these KS mosaics will facilitate both the discovery of novel polyketides by genome mining, as we demonstrate for the thailandamides of Burkholderia thailandensis, and the extraction of chemical information from short trans-AT PCR products, as we show using metagenomic DNA of marine sponges. Our data also suggest new strategies for dissecting polyketide biosynthetic pathways and engineering polyketide assembly.	1
Title: Mutations in the scaffoldin gene, cipA, of Clostridium thermocellum with impaired cellulosome formation and cellulose hydrolysis: insertions of a new transposable element, IS1447, and implications for cellulase synergism on crystalline cellulose Abstract: Mutants of Clostridium thermocellum that had lost the ability to adhere to microcrystalline cellulose were isolated. Six of them that showed diminished ability to depolymerize crystalline cellulose were selected. Size exclusion chromatography of the proteins from the culture supernatant revealed the loss of the supramolecular enzyme complex, the cellulosome. However, denaturing sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis resulted in extracellular protein patterns comparable to those of isolated cellulosomes, except for a missing CipA band. Sequencing of the six mutant cipA genes revealed a new insertion (IS) element, IS1447, belonging to the IS3 family. It was inserted into the cipA reading frame in four different locations: cohesin module 1, two different positions in the carbohydrate binding module, and cohesin module 3. The IS sequences were identical and consisted of a transposase gene and the inverted repeats IRR and IRS. The insertion resulted in an obviously nonspecific duplication of 3 base pairs within the target sequence. This lack of specificity allows transposition without the need of a defined target DNA sequence. Eighteen copies of IS1447 were identified in the genomic sequence of C. thermocellum ATCC 27405. At least one of them can be activated for transposition. Compared to the wild type, the mutant culture supernatant, with a completely defective CipA protein, showed equal specific hydrolytic activity against soluble beta-glucan but a 15-fold reduction in specific activity with crystalline cellulose. These results identify a genetic basis for the synergistic effect of complex formation on crystalline-cellulose degradation.	0
Title: Naphthyridinomycin biosynthesis revealing the use of leader peptide to guide nonribosomal peptide assembly Abstract: Analysis of naphthyridinomycin gene cluster revealed that this antibiotic is generated by nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) machinery. However, four modules encoded by two genes do not correspond with the structural units in the final product. Genetic and biochemical characterization of the gene cluster suggested that the leader peptide mechanism for the NRPS assembly line was involved in biosynthesis of this tetrahydroisoquinoline alkaloid.	1
Title: Sequence analysis of a 101-kilobase plasmid required for agar degradation by a Microscilla isolate Abstract: An agar-degrading marine bacterium identified as a Microscilla species was isolated from coastal California marine sediment. This organism harbored a single 101-kb circular DNA plasmid designated pSD15. The complete nucleotide sequence of pSD15 was obtained, and sequence analysis indicated a number of genes putatively encoding a variety of enzymes involved in polysaccharide utilization. The most striking feature was the occurrence of five putative agarase genes. Loss of the plasmid, which occurred at a surprisingly high frequency, was associated with loss of agarase activity, supporting the sequence analysis results.	0
Title: Participation of putative glycoside hydrolases SlgC1 and SlgC2 in the biosynthesis of streptolydigin in Streptomyces lydicus Abstract: Two genes of the streptolydigin gene cluster in Streptomyces lydicus cluster encode putative family 16 glycoside hydrolases. Both genes are expressed when streptolydigin is produced. Inactivation of these genes affects streptolydigin production when the microorganism is grown in minimal medium containing either glycerol or d-glucans as carbon source. Streptolydigin yields in S. lydicus were increased by overexpression of either slgC1 or slgC2.	1
Title: Unique molecular architecture of silk fibroin in the waxmoth, Galleria mellonella Abstract: Proteins of silk fibers are characterized by reiterations of amino acid repeats. Physical properties of the fiber are determined by the amino acid composition, the complexity of repetitive units, and arrangement of these units into higher order arrays. Except for very short motifs of 6-10 residues, the length of repetitive units and the number of these units concatenated in higher order assemblies vary in all spider and lepidopteran silks analyzed so far. This paper describes an exceptional silk protein represented by the 500-kDa heavy chain fibroin (H-fibroin) of the waxmoth, Galleria mellonella. Its non-repetitive N-terminal (175 residues) and C-terminal (60 residues) parts, the overall gene organization, and the nucleotide sequence around the TATA box show that it is homologous to the H-fibroins of other Lepidoptera. However, over 95% of the protein consists of highly ordered repetitive structures that are unmatched in other species. The repetitive region includes 11 assemblies AB(1)AB(1)AB(1)AB(2)(AB(2))AB(2) of remarkably conserved polypeptide repeats A (63 amino acid residues), B(1) (43 residues), and B(2) (18 residues). The repeats contain a high proportion of Gly (31.6%), Ala (23.8%), Ser (18.1%), and of residues with long hydrophobic side chains (16% for Leu, Ile, and Val combined). The presence of the GLGGLG and SSAASAA(AA) motifs suggests formation of pleated beta-sheets and their stacking into crystallites. Conspicuous conservation of the apolar sequence VIVI followed by DD or ED is interpreted as indicating the importance of hydrophobicity and electrostatic charge in H-fibroin cross-linking. The environment of G. mellonella larvae within bee cultures requires continuous production of silk that must be both strong and elastic. The spectacular arrangement of the repetitive H-fibroin region apparently evolved to meet these requirements.	0
Title: Directing the Heterologous Production of Specific Cyanobacterial Toxin Variants Abstract: Microcystins are globally the most commonly occurring freshwater cyanotoxins, causing acute poisoning and chronically inducing hepatocellular carcinoma. However, the detection and toxicological study of microcystins is hampered by the limited availability and high cost of pure toxin standards. Biosynthesis of microcystin variants in a fast-growing heterologous host offers a promising method of achieving reliable and economically viable alternative to isolating toxin from slow-growing cyanobacterial cultures. Here, we report the heterologous expression of recombinant microcystin synthetases in Escherichia coli to produce [d-Asp3]microcystin-LR and microcystin-LR. We assembled a 55 kb hybrid polyketide synthase/nonribosomal peptide synthetase gene cluster from Microcystis aeruginosa PCC 7806 using Red/ET recombineering and replaced the native promoters with an inducible PtetO promoter to yield microcystin titers superior to M. aeruginosa. The expression platform described herein can be tailored to heterologously produce a wide variety of microcystin variants, and potentially other cyanobacterial natural products of commercial relevance.	1
Title: Sungeidines from a Non-canonical Enediyne Biosynthetic Pathway Abstract: We report the genome-guided discovery of sungeidines, a class of microbial secondary metabolites with unique structural features. Despite evolutionary relationships with dynemicin-type enediynes, the sungeidines are produced by a biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) that exhibits distinct differences from known enediyne BGCs. Our studies suggest that the sungeidines are assembled from two octaketide chains that are processed differently than those of the dynemicin-type enediynes. The biosynthesis also involves a unique activating sulfotransferase that promotes a dehydration reaction. The loss of genes, including a putative epoxidase gene, is likely to be the main cause of the divergence of the sungeidine pathway from other canonical enediyne pathways. The findings disclose the surprising evolvability of enediyne pathways and set the stage for characterizing the intriguing enzymatic steps in sungeidine biosynthesis.	1
Title: The Biogenetic Origin of the Biologically Active Naematolin of Hypholoma Species Involves an Unusual Sesquiterpene Synthase Abstract: Naematolin is a biologically active sesquiterpene produced by Hypholoma species. Low titres and complex structure constrain the exploitation of this secondary metabolite. Here, we de novo sequenced the H. fasciculare genome to identify a candidate biosynthetic gene cluster for production of naematolin. Using Aspergillus oryzae as a heterologous host for gene expression, the activity of several sesquiterpene synthases were investigated, highlighting one atypical sesquiterpene synthase apparently capable of catalysing the 1,11 and subsequent 2,10 ring closures, which primes the synthesis of the distinctive structure of caryophyllene derivatives. Co-expression of the cyclase with an FAD oxidase adjacent within the gene cluster generated four oxidised caryophyllene-based sesquiterpenes: 5β,6α,8β-trihydroxycariolan, 5β,8β-dihydroxycariolan along with two previously unknown caryophyllene derivatives 2 and 3. This represents the first steps towards heterologous production of such basidiomycete-derived caryophyllene-based sesquiterpenes, opening a venue for potential novel antimicrobials via combinatorial biosynthesis.	1
Title: Antiplasmodial activity and mechanism of action of RSM-932A, a promising synergistic inhibitor of Plasmodium falciparum choline kinase Abstract: We have investigated the mechanism of action of inhibition of the choline kinase of P. falciparum (p.f.-ChoK) by two inhibitors of the human ChoKα, MN58b and RSM-932A, which have previously been shown to be potent antitumoral agents. The efficacy of these inhibitors against p.f.-ChoK is investigated using enzymatic and in vitro assays. While MN58b may enter the choline/phosphocholine binding site, RSM-932A appears to have an altogether novel mechanism of inhibition and is synergistic with respect to both choline and ATP. A model of inhibition for RSM-932A in which this inhibitor traps p.f.-ChoK in a phosphorylated intermediate state blocking phosphate transfer to choline is presented. Importantly, MN58b and RSM-932A have in vitro inhibitory activity in the low nanomolar range and are equally effective against chloroquine-sensitive and chloroquine-resistant strains. RSM-932A and MN58b significantly reduced parasitemia and induced the accumulation of trophozoites and schizonts, blocking intraerythrocytic development and interfering with parasite egress or invasion, suggesting a delay of the parasite maturation stage. The present data provide two new potent structures for the development of antimalarial compounds and validate p.f.-ChoK as an accessible drug target against the parasite.	0
Title: A squalene epoxidase is involved in biosynthesis of both the antitumor compound clavaric acid and sterols in the basidiomycete H. sublateritium Abstract: The basidiomycete Hypholoma sublateritium produces the triterpenoid antitumor clavaric acid, an inhibitor of the human Ras-farnesyl transferase. The H. sublateritium squalene epoxidase gene (erg1) has been cloned and shown to encode a flavoprotein monooxygenase that requires FAD, NADPH, and P450 cofactors. Silencing of the erg1 gene in H. sublateritium using constructions expressed from the gdh promoter of Agaricus bisporus showed that the squalene epoxidase is involved in clavaric acid formation and in ergosterol biosynthesis; silenced expression of erg1 resulted in an ergosterol-dependent phenotype for full growth. Overexpression of erg1 gene resulted in up to 32% to 97% increment of clavaric acid production confirming its involvement in the biosynthesis of this antitumor product. Oxidosqualene (or dioxidosqualene) appears to be the branching point for primary metabolism (sterols) and secondary metabolites in basidiomycetes.	1
Title: Heterologous Expression of the Nybomycin Gene Cluster from the Marine Strain Streptomyces albus subsp. chlorinus NRRL B-24108 Abstract: Streptomycetes represent an important reservoir of active secondary metabolites with potential applications in the pharmaceutical industry. The gene clusters responsible for their production are often cryptic under laboratory growth conditions. Characterization of these clusters is therefore essential for the discovery of new microbial pharmaceutical drugs. Here, we report the identification of the previously uncharacterized nybomycin gene cluster from the marine actinomycete Streptomyces albus subsp. chlorinus through its heterologous expression. Nybomycin has previously been reported to act against quinolone-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains harboring a mutated gyrA gene but not against those with intact gyrA. The nybomycin-resistant mutants generated from quinolone-resistant mutants have been reported to be caused by a back-mutation in the gyrA gene that restores susceptibility to quinolones. On the basis of gene function assignment from bioinformatics analysis, we suggest a model for nybomycin biosynthesis.	1
Title: Biosynthesis of the enediyne antitumor antibiotic C-1027 Abstract: C-1027 is a potent antitumor agent with a previously undescribed molecular architecture and mode of action. Cloning and characterization of the 85-kilobase C-1027 biosynthesis gene cluster from Streptomyces globisporus revealed (i) an iterative type I polyketide synthase that is distinct from any bacterial polyketide synthases known to date, (ii) a general polyketide pathway for the biosynthesis of both the 9- and 10-membered enediyne antibiotics, and (iii) a convergent biosynthetic strategy for the C-1027 chromophore from four building blocks. Manipulation of genes governing C-1027 biosynthesis allowed us to produce an enediyne compound in a predicted manner.	1
Title: MmpL genes are associated with mycolic acid metabolism in mycobacteria and corynebacteria Abstract: Mycolic acids are vital components of the cell wall of the tubercle bacillus Mycobacterium tuberculosis and are required for viability and virulence. While mycolic acid biosynthesis is studied extensively, components involved in mycolate transport remain unidentified. We investigated the role of large membrane proteins encoded by mmpL genes in mycolic acid transport in mycobacteria and the related corynebacteria. MmpL3 was found to be essential in mycobacteria and conditional depletion of MmpL3 in Mycobacterium smegmatis resulted in loss of cell wall mycolylation, and of the cell wall-associated glycolipid, trehalose dimycolate. In parallel, an accumulation of trehalose monomycolate (TMM) was observed, suggesting that mycolic acids were transported as TMM. In contrast to mycobacteria, we found redundancy in the role of two mmpL genes, in Corynebacterium glutamicum; a complete loss of trehalose-associated and cell wall bound corynomycolates was observed in an NCgl0228-NCgl2769 double mutant, but not in individual single mutants. Our studies highlight the role of mmpL genes in mycolic acid metabolism and identify potential new targets for anti-TB drug development.	0
Title: Studies on condensed-heterocyclic azolium cephalosporins. V. Synthesis and antibacterial activity of 3-(condensed-triazolo-pyridinium, -pyrimidinium, and -pyridazinium)-methyl cephalosporins Abstract: As a part of our studies on cephalosporins bearing condensed-heterocyclic azolium methyl groups at the 3 position in the cephalosporin nucleus, we describe here the synthesis and antibacterial activity of 7 beta-[2-(2-aminothiazol-4-yl)2(Z)-methoxyiminoacetamido] cephalosporins (1-16, 7 beta-[2-(2-amino-5-chlorothiazol-4-yl)-2(Z)- methoxyiminoacetamido] cephalosporins (17,18) and 7 beta-[2-(5-amino- 1,2,4-thiadiazol-3-yl)-2(Z)-methoxyiminoacetamido) cephalosporins (19-23) containing a variety of condensed-heterocyclic triazolium methyl groups at the 3 position in the cephalosporin nucleus. These cephalosporins exhibited potent antibacterial activity, and it appears that condensed-heterocyclic triazolium as well as condensed-heterocyclic imidazolium rings are effective moieties for improving antibacterial activity and the spectrum of activity. Among the cephalosporins tested, 7 beta-[2-(2-aminothiazol-4-yl)-2(Z)-methoxyiminoacetamido]-3-(5- methyl[1,2,3]triazolo-[1,5-alpha]pyridinium-1-yl)methyl-3-cephem-4- carboxylate (9) and 7 beta-[2-(2-aminothiazol-4-yl)-2(Z)-methoxyiminoacetamido]-3-(6- methoxy[1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-alpha]pyridinium-1-yl)methyl-3-cephem-4- carboxylate (11) showed good antibacterial activity.	0
Title: Synthesis of Axially Chiral 2,2'-Bisphosphobiarenes via a Nickel-Catalyzed Asymmetric Ullmann Coupling: General Access to Privileged Chiral Ligands without Optical Resolution Abstract: We report an asymmetric homocoupling of ortho-(iodo)arylphosphine oxides and ortho-(iodo)arylphosphonates resulting in highly enantioenriched axially chiral bisphosphine oxides and bisphosphonates. These products are readily converted to enantioenriched biaryl bisphosphines without need for chiral auxiliaries or optical resolution. This provides a practical route for the development of previously uninvestigated atroposelective biaryl bisphosphine ligands. The conditions have also proven effective for asymmetric dimerization of other, non-phosphorus-containing aryl halides.	0
Title: Salinipeptins: Integrated Genomic and Chemical Approaches Reveal Unusual d-Amino Acid-Containing Ribosomally Synthesized and Post-Translationally Modified Peptides (RiPPs) from a Great Salt Lake Streptomyces sp Abstract: Analysis of the full genome of an environmentally unique, halotolerant Streptomyces sp. strain GSL-6C, isolated from the Great Salt Lake, revealed a gene cluster encoding the biosynthesis of the salinipeptins, d-amino-acid-containing members of the rare linaridin subfamily of ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides (RiPPs). The sequence organization of the unmodified amino acid residues in salinipeptins A-D (1-4) were suggested by genome annotation, and subsequently, their sequence and post-translational modifications were defined using a range of spectroscopic techniques and chemical derivatization approaches. The salinipeptins are unprecedented linaridins bearing nine d-amino acids, which are uncommon in RiPP natural products and are the first reported in the linaridin subfamily. Whole genome mining of GSL-6C did not reveal any homologues of the reported genes responsible for amino acid epimerization in RiPPs, inferring new epimerases may be involved in the conversion of l- to d-amino acids. In addition, the N-oxide and dimethylimidazolidin-4-one moieties in salinipeptins B and C, which are modified from N, N-dimethylalanine, are unknown in bacterial peptides. The three-dimensional structure of salinipeptin A, possessing four loops generated by significant hydrogen bonding, was established on the basis of observed nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) correlations. This study demonstrates that integration of genomic information early in chemical analysis significantly facilitates the discovery and structure characterization of novel microbial secondary metabolites.	1
Title: 53BP1 regulates DSB repair using Rif1 to control 5' end resection Abstract: The choice between double-strand break (DSB) repair by either homology-directed repair (HDR) or nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) is tightly regulated. Defects in this regulation can induce genome instability and cancer. 53BP1 is critical for the control of DSB repair, promoting NHEJ, and inhibiting the 5' end resection needed for HDR. Using dysfunctional telomeres and genome-wide DSBs, we identify Rif1 as the main factor used by 53BP1 to impair 5' end resection. Rif1 inhibits resection involving CtIP, BLM, and Exo1; limits accumulation of BRCA1/BARD1 complexes at sites of DNA damage; and defines one of the mechanisms by which 53BP1 causes chromosomal abnormalities in Brca1-deficient cells. These data establish Rif1 as an important contributor to the control of DSB repair by 53BP1.	0
Title: Activation modes in biocatalytic radical cyclization reactions Abstract: Radical cyclizations are essential reactions in the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites and the chemical synthesis of societally valuable molecules. In this review, we highlight the general mechanisms utilized in biocatalytic radical cyclizations. We specifically highlight cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (P450s) involved in the biosynthesis of mycocyclosin and vancomycin, nonheme iron- and α-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases (Fe/αKGDs) used in the biosynthesis of kainic acid, scopolamine, and isopenicillin N, and radical S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) enzymes that facilitate the biosynthesis of oxetanocin A, menaquinone, and F420. Beyond natural mechanisms, we also examine repurposed flavin-dependent "ene"-reductases (ERED) for non-natural radical cyclization. Overall, these general mechanisms underscore the opportunity for enzymes to augment and enhance the synthesis of complex molecules using radical mechanisms.	0
Title: Transparent conductors from carbon nanotubes LBL-assembled with polymer dopant with π-π electron transfer Abstract: Single-walled carbon nanotube (SWNT) and other carbon-based coatings are being considered as replacements for indium tin oxide (ITO). The problems of transparent conductors (TCs) coatings from SWNT and similar materials include poor mechanical properties, high roughness, low temperature resilience, and fast loss of conductivity. The simultaneous realization of these desirable characteristics can be achieved using high structural control of layer-by-layer (LBL) deposition, which is demonstrated by the assembly of hydroethyl cellulose (HOCS) and sulfonated polyetheretherketone (SPEEK)-SWNTs. A new type of SWNT doping based on electron transfer from valence bands of nanotubes to unoccupied levels of SPEEK through π-π interactions was identified for this system. It leads to a conductivity of 1.1 × 10(5) S/m at 66 wt % loadings of SWNT. This is better than other polymer/SWNT composites and translates into surface conductivity of 920 Ω/◻ and transmittance of 86.7% at 550 nm. The prepared LBL films also revealed unusually high temperature resilience up to 500 °C, and low roughness of 3.5 nm (ITO glass -2.4 nm). Tensile modulus, ultimate strength, and toughness of such coatings are 13 ± 2 GPa, 366 ± 35 MPa, and 8 ± 3 kJ/m(3), respectively, and exceed corresponding parameters of all similar TCs. The cumulative figure of merit, ∏(TC), which included the critical failure strain relevant for flexible electronics, was ∏(TC) = 0.022 and should be compared to ∏(TC) = 0.006 for commercial ITO. Further optimization is possible using stratified nanoscale coatings and improved doping from the macromolecular LBL components.	0
Title: Knocking out of tailoring genes eryK and eryG in an industrial erythromycin-producing strain of Saccharopolyspora erythraea leading to overproduction of erythromycin B, C and D at different conversion ratios Abstract: Aims:                        To overproduce erythromycin C, B or D and evaluate the effect of disruption of tailoring genes eryK and eryG in an industrial erythromycin producer.                  Methods and results:                        The tailoring genes eryG and eryK were inactivated individually or simultaneously by targeted gene disruption in an industrial strain Saccharopolyspora erythraea HL3168 E3, resulting in the overproduction of erythromycin C (2·48 g l(-1) ), B (1·70 g l(-1) ) or D (2·15 g l(-1) ) in the mutant strain QL-G, QL-K or QL-KG, respectively. Analysis of the erythromycin congeners throughout the fermentation indicated that, at the end of fermentation, comparatively large amount of erythromycin D (0·67 g l(-1) ) was accumulated in QL-G, whereas only small amount of erythromycin D (0·10 g l(-1) ) was produced in QL-K.                  Conclusions:                       Inactivation of tailoring genes eryG and eryK in the high producer did not affect the biosynthesis of erythromycin. However, erythromycin D could be more efficiently methylated by EryG than be hydroxylated by EryK.                  Significance and impact of the study:                       Development of the mutant strains provides a method for the economical large-scale production of potent lead compounds. The information about the accumulation and conversion of erythromycins in the industrial strains may contribute to further improving erythromycin production.	1
Title: Preparation of 1-acyloxyethyl esters of 7-[2-(2-aminothiazol-4-yl)acetamido]-3-[[[1-(2-dimethylaminoe thy l)-1H-tetrazol-5-yl]thio]-methyl]ceph-3-em-4-carboxylic acid (cefotiam) and their oral absorption in mice Abstract: In a separate study on the orally active acyloxymethyl esters (1) of 7-[2-(2-aminothiazol-4-yl)acetamido]-3-[[[1-(2-dimethylaminoethyl) - 1H-tetrazol-5-yl]thio]methyl]ceph-3-em-4-carboxylic acid (cefotiam, CTM), we have shown, by quantitative structure-oral bioavailability (BA) relation analysis, that the R2 group in the acyl group R2CO must have both an adequate lipophilicity (Hansch's lipophilic parameter, pi) and steric hindrance (Taft's Es value). However, to satisfy these requirements, a complex alkyl group R2 must be employed, the ester of which is difficult to synthesize and has unique metabolic fate. In this study, we selected and prepared the 1-acyloxyethyl esters (2) of CTM instead of 1 to avoid R2 groups that are too complicated. We found that the esters (2) gave improved oral BAs over 1: the 1-(3-methyl-valeryloxy)ethyl ester (2h) showed the highest peak plasma CTM level (Cmax) comparable to that obtained after subcutaneous injection of CTM. The 1-(cyclohexylacetoxy)ethyl ester (2t), the 1-(2-ethylbutyryloxy)ethyl ester (2j), and 2h showed BAs near 100%. For these esters (2), good correlations were also observed among the pi, the Es values of R2, and the log Cmax and log BA in the analysis of the quantitative structure-oral bioavailability relation: an ester having an alkyl group as R2 with a pi value of 3.07 or 3.08 and a Es value of -1.04 or -1.29 gave the highest Cmax or BA, respectively. As expected, the optimal pi values are almost the same as those obtained with 1 but the optimal Es values are larger (Es = -2.07). Thus, it has been confirmed by preparing 1-acyloxyethyl esters (2) of CTM that the oral bioavailability of CTM can further be improved without preparing acyloxymethyl esters (1) with a complicated acyl group.	0
Title: Rhizobia from Lanzarote, the Canary Islands, that nodulate Phaseolus vulgaris have characteristics in common with Sinorhizobium meliloti isolates from mainland Spain Abstract: The stable, low-molecular-weight (LMW) RNA fractions of several rhizobial isolates of Phaseolus vulgaris grown in the soil of Lanzarote, an island of the Canary Islands, were identical to a less-common pattern found within Sinorhizobium meliloti (assigned to group II) obtained from nodules of alfalfa and alfalfa-related legumes grown in northern Spain. The P. vulgaris isolates and the group II LMW RNA S. meliloti isolates also were distinguishable in that both had two conserved inserts of 20 and 46 bp in the 16S-23S internal transcribed spacer region that were not present in other strains of S. meliloti. The isolates from P. vulgaris nodulated bean but not Medicago sativa, while those recovered from Medicago, Melilotus, and Trigonella spp. nodulated both host legumes. The bean isolates also were distinguished from those of Medicago, Melilotus, and Trigonella spp. by nodC sequence analysis. The nodC sequences of the bean isolates were most similar to those reported for S. meliloti bv. mediterranense and Sinorhizobium fredii bv. mediterranense (GenBank accession numbers DQ333891 and AF217267, respectively). None of the evidence placed the bean isolates from Lanzarote in the genus Rhizobium, which perhaps is inconsistent with seed-borne transmission of Rhizobium etli from the Americas to the Canaries as an explanation for the presence of bean-nodulating rhizobia in soils of Lanzarote.	0
Title: Substrate-specific transcription of the enigmatic GH61 family of the pathogenic white-rot fungus Heterobasidion irregulare during growth on lignocellulose Abstract: The GH61 represents the most enigmatic Glycoside Hydrolase family (GH) regarding enzymatic activity and importance in cellulose degradation. Heterobasidion irregulare is a necrotizing pathogen and white-rot fungus that causes enormous damages in conifer forests. The genome of H. irregulare allowed identification of ten HiGH61 genes. qRT-PCR analysis separate the HiGH61 members into two groups; one that show up regulation on lignocellulosic substrates (HiGH61A, HiGH61B, HiGH61D, HiGH61G, HiGH61H, and HiGH61I) and a second showing either down-regulation or constitutive expression (HiGH61C, HiGH61E, HiGH61F, and HiGH61J). HiGH61H showed up to 17,000-fold increase on spruce heartwood suggesting a pivotal role in cellulose decomposition during saprotrophic growth. Sequence analysis of these genes reveals that all GH61s except HiGH61G possess the conserved metal-binding motif essential for activity. The sequences also divide into groups having either an insert near the N terminus or an insert near the second catalytic histidine, which may represent extensions of the substrate-binding surface. Three of the HiGH61s encode cellulose-binding modules (CBM1). Interestingly, HiGH61H and HiGH61I having CBM1s are up-regulated on pure cellulose. There was a common substrate-specific induction patterns of the HiGH61s with several reference cellulolytic and hemicellulolytic GHs, this taken together with their low transcript levels on media lacking lignocellulose, reflect the concerted nature of cell wall polymer degradation.	0
Title: Bacterial Alkaloid Biosynthesis: Structural Diversity via a Minimalistic Nonribosomal Peptide Synthetase Abstract: Chemical and biochemical analyses of one of the most basic nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPS) from a Pseudomonas fluorescens strain revealed its striking plasticity. Determination of the potential substrate scope enabled us to anticipate novel secondary metabolites that could subsequently be isolated and tested for their bioactivities. Detailed analyses of the monomodular pyreudione synthetase showed that the biosynthesis of the bacterial pyreudione alkaloids does not require additional biosynthetic enzymes. Heterologous expression of a similar and functional, yet cryptic, NRPS of Pseudomonas entomophila was successful and allowed us to perform a phylogenetic analysis of their thioesterase domains.	1
Title: Mupirocin H, a novel metabolite resulting from mutation of the HMG-CoA synthase analogue, mupH in Pseudomonas fluorescens Abstract: Mutation of the HMG-CoA synthase encoding mupH gene in Pseudomonas fluorescens gives rise to a new metabolite formed from a truncated polyketide intermediate, providing in vivo evidence for the roles of mupH and cognate genes found in several "AT-less" and other bacterial PKS gene clusters responsible for the biosynthesis of diverse metabolites containing acetate/propionate derived side chains.	1
Title: Fattiviracin A1, a novel antiviral agent produced by Streptomyces microflavus strain No. 2445. II. Biological properties Abstract: Fattiviracin A1, showed potent antiviral activities against herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), varicella-zoster virus (VZV), influenza A virus and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). It showed no cytotoxicity against Vero cells. Fattiviracin A1 exhibited no significant antibacterial or antifungal activities. Treatment of HSV-1 with fattiviracin A1 decreased its infectivity to Vero cells. The mechanism of its antiviral activity may be due to inactivation of the viral particles and inhibition of viral entry into host cells.	0
Title: Plasmid- and chromosome-mediated dissimilation of naphthalene and salicylate in Pseudomonas putida PMD-1 Abstract: Pseudomonas putida PMD-1 dissimilates naphthalene (Nah), salicylate (Sal), and benzoate (Ben) via catechol which is metabolized through the meta (or alpha-keto acid) pathway. The ability to utilize salicylate but not naphthalene was transferred from P. putida PMD-1 to several Pseudomonas species. Agarose gel electrophoresis of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) from PMD-1 and Sal+ exconjugants indicated that a plasmid (pMWD-1) of 110 megadaltons is correlated with the Sal+ phenotype; restriction enzyme analysis of DNA from Sal+ exconjugants indicated that plasmid pMWD-1 was transmitted intact. Enzyme analysis of Sal+ exconjugants demonstrated that the enzymes required to oxidize naphthalene to salicylate are absent, but salicylate hydroxylase and enzymes of the meta pathway are present. Thus, naphthalene conversion to salicylate requires chromosomal genes, whereas salicylate degradation is plasmid encoded. Comparison of restriction digests of plasmid pMWD-1 indicated that it differs considerably from the naphthalene and salicylate degradative plasmids previously described in P. putida.	0
Title: Probing phospholipase a(2) with fluorescent phospholipid substrates Abstract: The Foerster resonance energy transfer-based sensor, PENN, measures intracellular phospholipase A(2) (PLA(2)) activity in living cells and small organisms. In an attempt to modify the probe for the detection of particular isoforms, we altered the sn-2 fatty acid in such a way that either one or three of the Z double bonds in arachidonic acid were present in the sensor molecule. Arachidonic-acid-mimicking fatty acids were prepared by copper-mediated coupling reactions. Probes with a single double bond in the 5-position exhibited favorable substrate properties for secretory PLA(2)s. In vitro experiments with the novel unsaturated doubly labeled phosphatidylethanolamine derivatives showed preferred cleavage of the sensor PENN2 (one double bond) by the physiologically important group V sPLA(2), while the O-methyl-derivative PMNN2 was accepted best by the isoform from hog pancreas. For experiments in living cells, we demonstrated that bioactivation via S-acetylthioethyl (SATE) groups is essential for probe performance. Surprisingly, membrane-permeant versions of the new sensors that contained double bonds, PENN2 and PENN3, were only cleaved to a minor extent in HeLa cells while the saturated form, PENN, was well accepted.	0
Title: Selective Neutral pH Inhibitor of Cathepsin B Designed Based on Cleavage Preferences at Cytosolic and Lysosomal pH Conditions Abstract: Cathepsin B is a cysteine protease that normally functions within acidic lysosomes for protein degradation, but in numerous human diseases, cathepsin B translocates to the cytosol having neutral pH where the enzyme activates inflammation and cell death. Cathepsin B is active at both the neutral pH 7.2 of the cytosol and the acidic pH 4.6 within lysosomes. We evaluated the hypothesis that cathepsin B may possess pH-dependent cleavage preferences that can be utilized for design of a selective neutral pH inhibitor by (1) analysis of differential cathepsin B cleavage profiles at neutral pH compared to acidic pH using multiplex substrate profiling by mass spectrometry (MSP-MS), (2) design of pH-selective peptide-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (AMC) substrates, and (3) design and validation of Z-Arg-Lys-acyloxymethyl ketone (AOMK) as a selective neutral pH inhibitor. Cathepsin B displayed preferences for cleaving peptides with Arg in the P2 position at pH 7.2 and Glu in the P2 position at pH 4.6, represented by its primary dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase and modest endopeptidase activity. These properties led to design of the substrate Z-Arg-Lys-AMC having neutral pH selectivity, and its modification with the AOMK warhead to result in the inhibitor Z-Arg-Lys-AOMK. This irreversible inhibitor displays nanomolar potency with 100-fold selectivity for inhibition of cathepsin B at pH 7.2 compared to pH 4.6, shows specificity for cathepsin B over other cysteine cathepsins, and is cell permeable and inhibits intracellular cathepsin B. These findings demonstrate that cathepsin B possesses pH-dependent cleavage properties that can lead to development of a potent, neutral pH inhibitor of this enzyme.	0
Title: Solution NMR approaches for establishing specificity of weak heterodimerization of membrane proteins Abstract: Solution NMR provides a powerful approach for detecting complex formation involving weak to moderate intermolecular affinity. However, solution NMR has only rarely been used to detect complex formation between two membrane proteins in model membranes. The impact of specific binding on the NMR spectrum of a membrane protein can be difficult to distinguish from spectral changes that are induced by nonspecific binding and/or by changes that arise from forced cohabitation of the two proteins in a single model membrane assembly. This is particularly the case when solubility limits make it impossible to complete a titration to the point of near saturation of complex formation. In this work experiments are presented that provide the basis for establishing whether specific complex formation occurs between two membrane proteins under conditions where binding is not of high avidity. Application of these methods led to the conclusion that the membrane protein CD147 (also known as EMMPRIN or basigin) forms a specific heterodimeric complex in the membrane with the 99-residue transmembrane C-terminal fragment of the amyloid precursor protein (C99 or APP-βCTF), the latter being the immediate precursor of the amyloid-β polypeptides that are closely linked to the etiology of Alzheimer's disease.	0
Title: Valproic Acid Induces Antimicrobial Compound Production in Doratomyces microspores Abstract: One of the biggest challenges in public health is the rising number of antibiotic resistant pathogens and the lack of novel antibiotics. In recent years there is a rising focus on fungi as sources of antimicrobial compounds due to their ability to produce a large variety of bioactive compounds and the observation that virtually every fungus may still contain yet unknown so called "cryptic," often silenced, compounds. These putative metabolites could include novel bioactive compounds. Considerable effort is spent on methods to induce production of these "cryptic" metabolites. One approach is the use of small molecule effectors, potentially influencing chromatin landscape in fungi. We observed that the supernatant of the fungus Doratomyces (D.) microsporus treated with valproic acid (VPA) displayed antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus (S.) aureus and two methicillin resistant clinical S. aureus isolates. VPA treatment resulted in enhanced production of seven antimicrobial compounds: cyclo-(L-proline-L-methionine) (cPM), p-hydroxybenzaldehyde, cyclo-(phenylalanine-proline) (cFP), indole-3-carboxylic acid, phenylacetic acid (PAA) and indole-3-acetic acid. The production of the antimicrobial compound phenyllactic acid was exclusively detectable after VPA treatment. Furthermore three compounds, cPM, cFP, and PAA, were able to boost the antimicrobial activity of other antimicrobial compounds. cPM, for the first time isolated from fungi, and to a lesser extent PAA, are even able to decrease the minimal inhibitory concentration of ampicillin in MRSA strains. In conclusion we could show in this study that VPA treatment is a potent tool for induction of "cryptic" antimicrobial compound production in fungi, and that the induced compounds are not exclusively linked to the secondary metabolism. Furthermore this is the first discovery of the rare diketopiperazine cPM in fungi. Additionally we could demonstrate that cPM and PAA boost antibiotic activity against antibiotic resistant strains, suggesting a possible application in combinatorial antibiotic treatment against resistant pathogens.	0
Title: Two Biosynthetic Pathways in Jahnella thaxteri for Thaxteramides, Distinct Types of Lipopeptides Abstract: The structures of five linear lipopeptides, thaxteramides A1, A2, B1, B2, and C isolated from the myxobacterium Jahnella thaxteri, were elucidated. They have a C-terminal common tetrapeptidic Tyr-Gly-β-Ala-Tyr core but differ in the stereochemistry of the tyrosine units, methylations, the remaining amino acids, and the N-terminal polyketide. In silico analysis of the genome sequence complemented with feeding experiments revealed two distinct hybrid PKS/NRPS gene clusters. Three semisynthesized cyclic analogues were found to inhibit the growth of Gram-positive bacteria.	1
Title: Identification and manipulation of the caprazamycin gene cluster lead to new simplified liponucleoside antibiotics and give insights into the biosynthetic pathway Abstract: Caprazamycins are potent anti-mycobacterial liponucleoside antibiotics isolated from Streptomyces sp. MK730-62F2 and belong to the translocase I inhibitor family. Their complex structure is derived from 5'-(beta-O-aminoribosyl)-glycyluridine and comprises a unique N-methyldiazepanone ring. The biosynthetic gene cluster has been identified, cloned, and sequenced, representing the first gene cluster of a translocase I inhibitor. Sequence analysis revealed the presence of 23 open reading frames putatively involved in export, resistance, regulation, and biosynthesis of the caprazamycins. Heterologous expression of the gene cluster in Streptomyces coelicolor M512 led to the production of non-glycosylated bioactive caprazamycin derivatives. A set of gene deletions validated the boundaries of the cluster and inactivation of cpz21 resulted in the accumulation of novel simplified liponucleoside antibiotics that lack the 3-methylglutaryl moiety. Therefore, Cpz21 is assigned to act as an acyltransferase in caprazamycin biosynthesis. In vivo and in silico analysis of the caprazamycin biosynthetic gene cluster allows a first proposal of the biosynthetic pathway and provides insights into the biosynthesis of related uridyl-antibiotics.	1
Title: Functions of genes and enzymes involved in phenalinolactone biosynthesis Abstract: Phenalinolactones are novel terpene glycoside antibiotics produced by Streptomyces sp. Tü6071. Inactivation of three oxygenase genes (plaO2, plaO3 and plaO5), two dehydrogenase genes (plaU, plaZ) and one putative acetyltransferase gene (plaV) led to the production of novel phenalinolactone derivatives (PL HS6, PL HS7, PL HS2 and PL X1). Furthermore, the exact biosynthetic functions of two enzymes were determined, and their in vitro activities were demonstrated. PlaO1, an Fe(II)/alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase, is responsible for the key step in gamma-butyrolactone formation, whereas PlaO5, a cytochrome P450-dependent monooxygenase, catalyses the 1-C-hydroxylation of phenalinolactone D. In addition, stable isotope feeding experiments with biosynthetic precursors shed light on the origin of the carbons in the gamma-butyrolactone moiety.	1
Title: A nonpeptidic cathepsin S activity-based probe for noninvasive optical imaging of tumor-associated macrophages Abstract: Macrophage infiltration into tumors has been correlated with poor clinical outcome in multiple cancer types. Therefore, tools to image tumor-associated macrophages could be valuable for diagnosis and prognosis of cancer. Herein, we describe the synthesis and characterization of a cathepsin S-directed, quenched activity-based probe (qABP), BMV083. This probe makes use of an optimized nonpeptidic scaffold leading to enhanced in vivo properties relative to previously reported peptide-based probes. In a syngeneic breast cancer model, BMV083 provides high tumor-specific fluorescence that can be visualized using noninvasive optical imaging methods. Furthermore, analysis of probe-labeled cells demonstrates that the probe primarily targets macrophages with an M2 phenotype. Thus, BMV083 is a potential valuable in vivo reporter for tumor-associated macrophages that could greatly facilitate the future studies of macrophage function in the process of tumorigenesis.	0
Title: Antiproliferative prenylated stilbenes and flavonoids from Macaranga alnifolia from the Madagascar rainforest Abstract: Bioassay-guided fractionation of an extract of the fruit of Macaranga alnifolia from Madagascar led to the isolation of four new prenylated stilbenes, schweinfurthins E-H (1-4), and one new geranylated dihydroflavonol, alnifoliol (5). The known prenylated stilbene vedelianin (6) and the known geranylated flavonoids bonanniol A (7), diplacol (8), bonannione A (9), and diplacone (10) were also isolated. All 10 compounds were tested for antiproliferative activity in the A2780 human ovarian cancer cell line assay. Vedelianin (IC50 = 0.13 microM) exhibited the greatest activity among all isolates, while schweinfurthin E (IC50 = 0.26 microM) was the most potent of the new compounds.	0
Title: Biosynthetic pathway for high structural diversity of a common dilactone core in antimycin production Abstract: We herein report comparative analysis of two versions of the biosynthetic gene clusters of antimycins, a natural product family possessing up to 44 distinct entities. The biosynthetic pathway of antimycins is amenable to the high structural variation of the substrates, supported by successes in heterologous expression of the ant cluster and in fluorine incorporation. The latter facilitated the investigation of the structure-activity relationship into the usually invariable 3-formamidosalicylic acid moiety of the molecules.	1
Title: Effects of tetrodotoxin on the mammalian cardiovascular system Abstract: The human genome encodes nine functional voltage-gated Na+ channels. Three of them, namely Na(v)1.5, Na(v)1.8, and Na(v)1.9, are resistant to nanomolar concentrations of tetrodotoxin (TTX; IC(50) > or = 1 microM). The other isoforms, which are predominantly expressed in the skeletal muscle and nervous system, are highly sensitive to TTX (IC(50) approximately 10 nM). During the last two decades, it has become evident that in addition to the major cardiac isoform Na(v)1.5, several of those TTX sensitive isoforms are expressed in the mammalian heart. Whereas immunohistochemical and electrophysiological methods demonstrated functional expression in various heart regions, the physiological importance of those isoforms for cardiac excitation in higher mammals is still debated. This review summarizes our knowledge on the systemic cardiovascular effects of TTX in animals and humans, with a special focus on cardiac excitation and performance at lower concentrations of this marine drug. Altogether, these data strongly suggest that TTX sensitive Na+ channels, detected more recently in various heart tissues, are not involved in excitation phenomena in the healthy adult heart of higher mammals.	0
Title: Canthaxanthin biosynthesis by the conversion of methylene to keto groups in a hydrocarbon beta-carotene by a single gene Abstract: Compounds that include (a) keto group(s) in a molecule are ubiquitous natural components. A novel gene involved in ketocompound biosynthesis, designated crtW, was isolated from the marine bacteria Agrobacterium aurantiacum and Alcaligenes PC-1 that produce ketocarotenoids such as astaxanthin. When this gene was introduced into Escherichia coli that accumulated beta-carotene due to the Erwinia carotenogenic genes, the E. coli transformants synthesized canthaxanthin, one of ketocarotenoids, which was identified after purification by its visible, FD-MS and 1H-NMR spectral analysis. It has been demonstrated for the first time that one gene encodes an enzyme "ketolase" that catalyzes the conversion of methylene groups of a hydrocarbon beta-carotene to keto groups for synthesizing canthaxanthin via echinenone.	1
Title: Biosynthesis of mupirocin by Pseudomonas fluorescens NCIMB 10586 involves parallel pathways Abstract: Mupirocin, a clinically important antibiotic produced via a trans-AT Type I polyketide synthase (PKS) in Pseudomonas fluorescens, consists of a mixture of mainly pseudomonic acids A, B, and C. Detailed metabolic profiling of mutant strains produced by systematic inactivation of PKS and tailoring genes, along with re-feeding of isolated metabolites to mutant stains, has allowed the isolation of a large number of novel metabolites, identification of the 10,11-epoxidase, and full characterization of the mupirocin biosynthetic pathway, which proceeds via major (10,11-epoxide) and minor (10,11-alkene) parallel pathways.	1
Title: Insights on Escherichia coli biofilm formation and inhibition from whole-transcriptome profiling Abstract: Biofilms transform independent cells into specialized cell communities. Here are presented some insights into biofilm formation ascertained with the best-characterized strain, Escherichia coli. Investigations of biofilm formation and inhibition with this strain using whole-transcriptome profiling coupled to phenotypic assays, in vivo DNA binding studies and isogenic mutants have led to discoveries related to the role of stress, to the role of intra- and interspecies cell signalling, to the impact of the environment on cell signalling, to biofilm inhibition by manipulating cell signalling, to the role of toxin/antitoxin genes in biofilm formation, and to the role of small RNAs on biofilm formation and dispersal. Hence, E. coli is an excellent resource for determining paradigms in biofilm formation and biofilm inhibition.	0
Title: Biosynthesis of lycosantalonol, a cis-prenyl derived diterpenoid Abstract: Terpenoid natural products are generally derived from isoprenyl diphosphate precursors with trans double-bond configuration, and no diterpenoid derived from the cisoid precursor (Z,Z,Z)-nerylneryl diphosphate (1) has yet been identified. Here further investigation of a terpenoid biosynthetic gene cluster from tomato is reported, which resulted in identification of a biosynthetic pathway from 1, in a pathway featuring a number of interesting transformations. Compound 1 is first cyclized to a tricyclene core ring structure analogous to that found in α-santalene, with the resulting diterpene termed here lycosantalene (2). Quantum chemical calculations indicate a role for the diphosphate anion coproduct in this cyclization reaction. Subsequently, the internal cis double bond of the neryl side chain in 2 is then further transformed to an α-hydroxy ketone moiety via an epoxide intermediate (3). Oxygen labeling studies indicate 3 undergoes oxidative conversion to lycosantalonol (4). Thus, in addition to elucidating the cisoid origins of 4, this work has further provided mechanistic insight into the interesting transformations required for its production.	0
Title: The binding pattern of two carbohydrate-binding modules of laminarinase Lam16A from Thermotoga neapolitana: differences in beta-glucan binding within family CBM4 Abstract: Carbohydrate-binding modules (CBMs) are often part of the complex hydrolytic extracellular enzymes from bacteria and may modulate their catalytic activity. The thermostable catalytic domain of laminarinase Lam16A from Thermotoga neapolitana (glycosyl hydrolase family 16) is flanked by two CBMs, 148 and 161 aa long. They share a sequence identity of 30%, are homologous to family CBM4 and are thus called CBM4-1 and CBM4-2 respectively. Recombinant Lam16A proteins deleted for one or both binding modules and the isolated module CBM4-1 were characterized. Proteins containing the N-terminal module CBM4-1 bound to the soluble polysaccharides laminarin (1,3-beta-glucan) and barley 1,3/1,4-beta-glucan, and proteins containing the C-terminal module CBM4-2 bound additionally to curdlan (1,3-beta-glucan) and pustulan (1,6-beta-glucan), and to insoluble yeast cell wall beta-glucan. The activity of the catalytic domain on soluble 1,3-beta-glucans was stimulated by the presence of CBM4-1, whereas the presence of CBM4-2 enhanced the Lam16A activity towards gelatinized and insoluble or mixed-linkage 1,3-beta-glucan. Thermostability of the catalytic domain was not affected by the truncations. Members of family CBM4 can be divided into four subfamilies, members of which show different polysaccharide-binding specificities corresponding to the catalytic specificities of the associated hydrolytic domains.	0
Title: MRI-based detection of alkaline phosphatase gene reporter activity using a porphyrin solubility switch Abstract: The ability to map patterns of gene expression noninvasively in living animals could have impact in many areas of biology. Reporter systems compatible with MRI could be particularly valuable, but existing strategies tend to lack sensitivity or specificity. Here we address the challenge of MRI-based gene mapping using the reporter enzyme secreted alkaline phosphatase (SEAP), in conjunction with a water-soluble metalloporphyrin contrast agent. SEAP cleaves the porphyrin into an insoluble product that accumulates at sites of enzyme expression and can be visualized by MRI and optical absorbance. The contrast mechanism functions in vitro, in brain slices, and in animals. The system also provides the possibility of readout both in the living animal and by postmortem histology, and it notably does not require intracellular delivery of the contrast agent. The solubility switch mechanism used to detect SEAP could be adapted for imaging of additional reporter enzymes or endogenous targets.	0
Title: Research Progress of the Biosynthesis of Natural Bio-Antibacterial Agent Pulcherriminic Acid in Bacillus Abstract: Pulcherriminic acid is a cyclic dipeptide found mainly in Bacillus and yeast. Due to the ability of pulcherriminic acid to chelate Fe3+ to produce reddish brown pulcherrimin, microorganisms capable of synthesizing pulcherriminic acid compete with other microorganisms for environmental iron ions to achieve bacteriostatic effects. Therefore, studying the biosynthetic pathway and their enzymatic catalysis, gene regulation in the process of synthesis of pulcherriminic acid in Bacillus can facilitate the industrial production, and promote the wide application in food, agriculture and medicine industries. After initially discussing, this review summarizes current research on the synthesis of pulcherriminic acid by Bacillus, which includes the crystallization of key enzymes, molecular catalytic mechanisms, regulation of synthetic pathways, and methods to improve efficiency in synthesizing pulcherriminic acid and its precursors. Finally, possible applications of pulcherriminic acid in the fermented food, such as Chinese Baijiu, applying combinatorial biosynthesis will be summarized.	1
Title: Moving posttranslational modifications forward to biosynthesize the glycosylated thiopeptide nocathiacin I in Nocardia sp. ATCC202099 Abstract: Characterization of the biosynthetic gene cluster of glycosylated antibiotic nocathiacin I (NOC-I) here adds new insights to thiopeptide biosynthesis, showing the NOC-specific tailoring and unusual sugar formation. NOC-I biosynthesis shares the paradigm for forming a common thiopeptide core and the generality for converting to an e series member, as that of the parent compound nosiheptide (NOS). This may permit the production of NOC-I in the genetically amenable, NOS-producing strain by building NOC-specific genes for pathway engineering.	1
Title: The Arabidopsis gain-of-function mutant ssi4 requires RAR1 and SGT1b differentially for defense activation and morphological alterations Abstract: A gain-of-function mutation in resistance (R) gene SSI4 causes constitutive activation of defense responses, spontaneous necrotic lesion formation, enhanced resistance against virulent pathogens, and a severe dwarf phenotype. Genetic analysis revealed that ssi4-induced H(2)O(2) accumulation and spontaneous cell death require RAR1, whereas ssi4-mediated stunting is dependent on SGT1b. By contrast, both RAR1 and SGT1b are required in a genetically additive manner for ssi4-induced disease resistance, SA accumulation, and lesion formation after pathogen infection. These data point to cooperative yet distinct functions of RAR1 and SGT1b in responses conditioned by a deregulated nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat protein. We also found that RAR1 and SGT1b together contribute to basal resistance because an ssi4 rar1 sgt1b triple mutant exhibited enhanced susceptibility to virulent pathogen infection compared with wild-type SSI4 plants. All ssi4-induced phenotypes were suppressed when plants were grown at 22 degrees C under high relative humidity. However, low temperature (16 degrees C) triggered ssi4-mediated cell death via an RAR1-dependent pathway even in the presence of high humidity. Thus, multiple environmental factors impact on ssi4 signaling, as has been observed for other constitutive defense mutants and R gene-triggered pathways.	0
Title: Antiproliferative withanolides from Datura wrightii Abstract: A new withanolide, named withawrightolide (1), and four known withanolides (2-5) were isolated from the aerial parts of Datura wrightii. The structure of compound 1 was elucidated through 2D NMR and other spectroscopic techniques. In addition, the structure of withametelin L (2) was confirmed by X-ray crystallographic analysis. Using MTS viability assays, withanolides 1-5 showed antiproliferative activities against human glioblastoma (U251 and U87), head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (MDA-1986), and normal fetal lung fibroblast (MRC-5) cells with IC50 values in the range between 0.56 and 5.6 μM.	0
Title: Cooperative NHC/Photoredox Catalyzed Ring-Opening of Aryl Cyclopropanes to 1-Aroyloxylated-3-Acylated Alkanes Abstract: Cyclopropanes are an important class of building blocks in organic synthesis. Herein, a ring-opening/arylcarboxylation/acylation cascade reaction for the 1,3-difunctionalization of aryl cyclopropanes enabled by cooperative NHC and organophotoredox catalysis is reported. The cascade works on monosubstituted cyclopropanes that are in contrast to the heavily investigated donor-acceptor cyclopropanes more challenging to be difunctionalized. The key step is a radical/radical cross coupling of a benzylic radical generated in the photoredox catalysis cycle with a ketyl radical from the NHC catalysis cycle. The transformation features metal-free reaction conditions and tolerates a diverse range of functionalities.	0
Title: Yeast homologous recombination cloning leading to the novel peptides ambactin and xenolindicin Abstract: Heterologous production of GameXPeptide A (1), as well as of the novel peptide natural products ambactin (2) and xenolindicins A-C (3 a-c), was achieved by using the "overlap extension PCR-yeast homologous recombination" (ExRec) method. ExRec cloning is based on the ability of yeast to assemble overlapping DNA fragments into functional plasmids. Here we used this technique to clone a total of 15 biosynthesis gene clusters from Photorhabdus and Xenorhabdus with sizes of up to 45 kb. The structures of the novel compounds 2 and 3 a, which were produced in Escherichia coli, were elucidated by detailed MS and bioinformatics analysis, and additionally confirmed by their chemical synthesis.	1
Title: Substrate Protection in Controlled Enzymatic Transformation of Peptides and Proteins Abstract: Proteins are involved in practically every single biological process. The many enzymes involved in their synthesis, cleavage, and posttranslational modification (PTM) carry out highly specific tasks with no usage of protecting groups. Yet, the chemists' strategy of protection/deprotection potentially can be highly useful, for example, when a specific biochemical reaction catalyzed by a broad-specificity enzyme needs to be inhibited, during infection of cells by enveloped viruses, in the invasion and spread of cancer cells, and upon mechanistic investigation of signal-transduction pathways. Doing so requires highly specific binding of peptide substrates in aqueous solution with biologically competitive affinities. Recent development of peptide-imprinted cross-linked micelles allows such protection and affords previously impossible ways of manipulating peptides and proteins in enzymatic transformations.	0
Title: Time-resolved determination of the CcpA regulon of Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris MG1363 Abstract: Carbon catabolite control protein A (CcpA) is the main regulator involved in carbon catabolite repression in gram-positive bacteria. Time series gene expression analyses of Lactococcus lactis MG1363 and L. lactis MG1363DeltaccpA using DNA microarrays were used to define the CcpA regulon of L. lactis. Based on a comparison of the transcriptome data with putative CcpA binding motifs (cre sites) in promoter sequences in the genome of L. lactis, 82 direct targets of CcpA were predicted. The main differences in time-dependent expression of CcpA-regulated genes were differences between the exponential and transition growth phases. Large effects were observed for carbon and nitrogen metabolic genes in the exponential growth phase. Effects on nucleotide metabolism genes were observed primarily in the transition phase. Analysis of the positions of putative cre sites revealed that there is a link between either repression or activation and the location of the cre site within the promoter region. Activation was observed when putative cre sites were located upstream of the hexameric -35 sequence at an average position of -56.5 or further upstream with decrements of 10.5 bp. Repression was observed when the cre site was located in or downstream of putative -35 and -10 sequences. The highest level of repression was observed when the cre site was present at a defined side of the DNA helix relative to the canonical -10 sequence. Gel retardation experiments, Northern blotting, and enzyme assays showed that CcpA represses its own expression and activates the expression of the divergently oriented prolidase-encoding pepQ gene, which constitutes a link between regulation of carbon metabolism and regulation of nitrogen metabolism.	0
Title: Outer Membrane Vesicle-Mediated Codelivery of the Antifungal HSAF Metabolites and Lytic Polysaccharide Monooxygenase in the Predatory Lysobacter enzymogenes Abstract: Lysobacter are new biocontrol agents known for their prolific production of lytic enzymes and bioactive metabolites. L. enzymogenes is a predator of fungi and produces several structurally distinct antimicrobial compounds, such as the antifungal HSAF (heat stable antifungal factor) and analogs. The mechanism by which L. enzymogenes interacts with fungal prey is not well understood. Here, we found that the production of HSAF and analogs in L. enzymogenes OH11 was significantly induced in media supplemented with ground fungal mycelia or chitin. In the OH11 genome, we identified a gene (LeLPMO10A) that was annotated to encode a chitin-binding protein. The stimulation of HSAF and analogs by chitin was diminished when LeLPMO10A was deleted. We expressed the gene in E. coli and demonstrated that purified LeLPMO10A oxidatively cleaved chitin into oligomeric products, including 1,5 δ-lactones and aldonic acids. The results revealed that LeLPMO10A encodes a lytic polysaccharide monooxygenase, which has not been reported in Lysobacter. The metabolite analysis, antifungal assay, and proteomic analysis showed that the antifungal compounds and the chitin-cleaving LeLPMO10A are colocalized in outer membrane vesicles. The enzymatic products that resulted from in vitro LeLPMO10A-cleaved chitin also significantly induced HSAF and analogs in OH11. Scanning electron microscopic analysis indicated that spherical vesicles were formed outside of OH11 cells, and fewer OH11 cells were observed to attach to fungal hyphae when LeLPMO10A was deleted. Together, the study revealed a previously uncharacterized synergistic strategy utilized by the predatory Lysobacter during interaction with fungal prey.	0
Title: Identification of a novel sesquiterpene biosynthetic machinery involved in astellolide biosynthesis Abstract: Esterified drimane-type sesquiterpene lactones such as astellolides display various biological activities and are widely produced by plants and fungi. Given their low homology to known sesquiterpene cyclases, the genes responsible for their biosynthesis have not been uncovered yet. Here, we identified the astellolide gene cluster from Aspergillus oryzae and discovered a novel sesquiterpene biosynthetic machinery consisting of AstC, AstI, and AstK. All these enzymes are annotated as haloacid dehalogenase-like hydrolases, whereas AstC also contains a DxDTT motif conserved in class II diterpene cyclases. Based on enzyme reaction analyses, we found that AstC catalysed the protonation-initiated cyclisation of farnesyl pyrophosphate into drimanyl pyrophosphate. This was successively dephosphorylated by AstI and AstK to produce drim-8-ene-11-ol. Moreover, we also identified and characterised a unique non-ribosomal peptide synthetase, AstA, responsible for esterifying aryl acids to drimane-type sesquiterpene lactones. In this study, we highlight a new biosynthetic route for producing sesquiterpene and its esterified derivative. Our findings shed light on the identification of novel sesquiterpenes via genome mining.	1
Title: Curtisians A-D, new free radical scavengers from the mushroom Paxillus curtisii Abstract: In our continuous investigation for free radical scavengers from extracts of fruit body of basidiomycetes, we have isolated four new p-terphenyl compounds, designated as curtisians A-D, from the methanolic extract of the fruit body of Paxillus curtisii. These compounds were isolated by silica gel and Sephadex LH-20 column chromatographies, preparative-TLC and HPLC, consecutively. The structures of curtisians were assigned as p-terphenyls with substituents of acetyl, benzoyl, phenylbutyryl, 3-hydroxybutyryl and 3-acetoxybutyryl. Curtisians A, B, C and D exhibited inhibitory activity against lipid peroxidation with IC50, values of 0.15, 0.17, 0.24 and 0.14 microg/ml, respectively.	0
Title: The DESIGNER Approach Helps Decipher the Hypoglycemic Bioactive Principles of Artemisia dracunculus (Russian Tarragon) Abstract: Complementing classical drug discovery, phytochemicals act on multiple pharmacological targets, especially in botanical extracts, where they form complex bioactive mixtures. The reductionist approach used in bioactivity-guided fractionation to identify single bioactive phytochemicals is inadequate for capturing the full therapeutic potential of the (bio)chemical interactions present in such complex mixtures. This study used a DESIGNER (Deplete and Enrich Select Ingredients to Generate Normalized Extract Resources) approach to selectively remove the known bioactives, 4'-O-methyldavidigenin (1; 4,2'-dihydroxy-4'-methoxydihydrochalcone, syn. DMC-1) and its isomer 4-O-methyldavidigenin (2; syn. DMC-2), from the mixture of phytochemicals in an ethanol extract from Artemisia dracunculus to determine to what degree the more abundant 2 accounts for the established antidiabetic effect of the A. dracunculus extract. Using an otherwise chemically intact "knock-out extract" depleted in 2 and its regioisomer, 1, in vitro and in vivo outcomes confirmed that 2 (and likely 1) acts as major bioactive(s) that enhance(s) insulin signaling in skeletal muscle, but also revealed that 2 does not account for the breadth of detectable biological activity of the extract. This is the first report of generating, at a sufficiently large preparative scale, a "knock-out extract" used as a pharmacological tool for in vitro and in vivo studies to dissect the biological impact of a designated bioactive in a complex phytochemical mixture.	0
Title: Comparative analysis of cleavable azobenzene-based affinity tags for bioorthogonal chemical proteomics Abstract: The advances in bioorthogonal ligation methods have provided new opportunities for proteomic analysis of newly synthesized proteins, posttranslational modifications, and specific enzyme families using azide/alkyne-functionalized chemical reporters and activity-based probes. Efficient enrichment and elution of azide/alkyne-labeled proteins with selectively cleavable affinity tags are essential for protein identification and quantification applications. Here, we report the synthesis and comparative analysis of Na₂S₂O₄-cleavable azobenzene-based affinity tags for bioorthogonal chemical proteomics. We demonstrated that ortho-hydroxyl substituent is required for efficient azobenzene-bond cleavage and show that these cleavable affinity tags can be used to identify newly synthesized proteins in bacteria targeted by amino acid chemical reporters as well as their sites of modification on endogenously expressed proteins. The azobenzene-based affinity tags are compatible with in-gel, in-solution, and on-bead enrichment strategies and should afford useful tools for diverse bioorthogonal proteomic applications.	0
Title: Crochelins: Siderophores with an Unprecedented Iron-Chelating Moiety from the Nitrogen-Fixing Bacterium Azotobacter chroococcum Abstract: Microbes use siderophores to access essential iron resources in the environment. Over 500 siderophores are known, but they utilize a small set of common moieties to bind iron. Azotobacter chroococcum expresses iron-rich nitrogenases, with which it reduces N2 . Though an important agricultural inoculant, the structures of its iron-binding molecules remain unknown. Here, the "chelome" of A. chroococcum is examined using small molecule discovery and bioinformatics. The bacterium produces vibrioferrin and amphibactins as well as a novel family of siderophores, the crochelins. Detailed characterization shows that the most abundant member, crochelin A, binds iron in a hexadentate fashion using a new iron-chelating γ-amino acid. Insights into the biosynthesis of crochelins and the mechanism by which iron may be removed upon import of the holo-siderophore are presented. This work expands the repertoire of iron-chelating moieties in microbial siderophores.	1
Title: Chemical reporter for visualizing metabolic cross-talk between carbohydrate metabolism and protein modification Abstract: Metabolic chemical reporters have been largely used to study posttranslational modifications. Generally, it was assumed that these reporters entered one biosynthetic pathway, resulting in labeling of one type of modification. However, because they are metabolized by cells before their addition onto proteins, metabolic chemical reporters potentially provide a unique opportunity to read-out on both modifications of interest and cellular metabolism. We report here the development of a metabolic chemical reporter 1-deoxy-N-pentynyl glucosamine (1-deoxy-GlcNAlk). This small-molecule cannot be incorporated into glycans; however, treatment of mammalian cells results in labeling of a variety proteins and enables their visualization and identification. Competition of this labeling with sodium acetate and an acetyltransferase inhibitor suggests that 1-deoxy-GlcNAlk can enter the protein acetylation pathway. These results demonstrate that metabolic chemical reporters have the potential to isolate and potentially discover cross-talk between metabolic pathways in living cells.	0
Title: Biosynthetic studies and genetic engineering of pactamycin analogs with improved selectivity toward malarial parasites Abstract: Pactamycin, one of the most densely functionalized aminocyclitol antibiotics, has pronounced antibacterial, antitumor, antiviral, and antiplasmodial activities, but its development as a clinical drug was hampered by its broad cytotoxicity. Efforts to modulate the biological activity by structural modifications using synthetic organic chemistry have been difficult because of the complexity of its chemical structure. However, through extensive biosynthetic studies and genetic engineering, we were able to produce analogs of pactamycin that show potent antimalarial activity, but lack significant antibacterial activity, and are about 10-30 times less toxic than pactamycin toward mammalian cells. The results suggest that distinct ribosomal binding selectivity or new mechanism(s) of action may be involved in their plasmodial growth inhibition, which may lead to the discovery of new antimalarial drugs and identification of new molecular targets within malarial parasites.	1
Title: Discovery of a Cryptic Depsipeptide from Streptomyces ghanaensis via MALDI-MS-Guided High-Throughput Elicitor Screening Abstract: Microbial genomes harbor an abundance of biosynthetic gene clusters, but most are expressed at low levels and need to be activated for characterization of their cognate natural products. In this work, we report the combination of high-throughput elicitor screening (HiTES) with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) for the rapid identification of cryptic peptide natural products. Application to Streptomyces ghanaensis identified amygdalin as an elicitor of a novel non-ribosomal peptide, which we term cinnapeptin. Complete structural elucidation revealed cinnapeptin as a cyclic depsipeptide with an unusual 2-methyl-cinnamoyl group. Insights into its biosynthesis were provided by whole genome sequencing and gene deletion studies, while bioactivity assays showed antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive bacteria and fission yeast. MALDI-HiTES is a broadly applicable tool for the discovery of cryptic peptides encoded in microbial genomes.	1
Title: NMR studies of chromomycins, olivomycins, and their derivatives Abstract: Detailed studies on the 13C and 1H NMR spectra of chromomycins A2 and A3, olivomycins A and B, and their derivatives clarified the assignment of many signals which had been unassigned or erroneously reported in the literatures. The revised assignments for chromomycin A3 and olivomycin A include the assignment of a key 13C signal used to discuss the saccharide linkage in question. Structure analyses based on the revised assignments support the alpha,1----3-bond between components of the disaccharide moiety in the molecules. Some general information useful for structure analysis of saccharides is also reported.	0
Title: Genetically controlled self-aggregation of cell-surface-engineered yeast responding to glucose concentration Abstract: We constructed an arming (cell-surface-engineered) yeast displaying two types of agglutinin (modified a-agglutinin and alpha-agglutinin) on the cell surface, with agglutination being independent of both mating type and pheromones. The modified a-agglutinin was artificially prepared by the fusion of the genes encoding Aga1p and Aga2p. The modified a-agglutinin could induce agglutination of cells displaying Agalpha1p (alpha-agglutinin). The upstream region of the isocitrate lyase gene of Candida tropicalis (UPR-ICL), active at a low glucose concentration, was used as the promoter to express the modified a-agglutinin- and alpha-agglutinin-encoding genes. The arming yeast displaying both agglutinins agglutinated and sedimented in response to decreased glucose concentration. When the glucose concentration was high, the arming yeast grew normally. In the late log phase, when the glucose concentration became very low, agglutination occurred suddenly and drastically and yeast cells sedimented completely. Sedimentation was confirmed by weighing the aggregated cells after filtration of the broth. Strains in which aggregation can be genetically controlled can be used in industrial processes in which the separation of yeast cells from the supernatant is necessary.	0
Title: Purification, characterization, and gene sequence of michiganin A, an actagardine-like lantibiotic produced by the tomato pathogen Clavibacter michiganensis subsp. michiganensis Abstract: Members of the actinomycete genus Clavibacter are known to produce antimicrobial compounds, but so far none of these compounds has been purified and characterized. We have isolated an antimicrobial peptide, michiganin A, from the tomato pathogen Clavibacter michiganensis subsp. michiganensis, using ammonium sulfate precipitation followed by cation-exchange and reversed-phase chromatography steps. Upon chemical derivatization of putative dehydrated amino acids and lanthionine bridges by alkaline ethanethiol, Edman degradation yielded sequence information that proved to be sufficient for cloning of the gene by a genome-walking strategy. The mature unmodified peptide consists of 21 amino acids, SSSGWLCTLTIECGTIICACR. All of the threonine residues undergo dehydration, and three of them interact with cysteines via thioether bonds to form methyllanthionine bridges. Michiganin A resembles actagardine, a type B lantibiotic with a known three-dimensional structure, produced by Actinoplanes liguriae, which is a filamentous actinomycete. The DNA sequence of the gene showed that the michiganin A precursor contains an unusual putative signal peptide with no similarity to well-known secretion signals and only very limited similarity to the (only two) available leader peptides of other type B lantibiotics. Michiganin A inhibits the growth of Clavibacter michiganensis subsp. sepedonicus, the causal agent of ring rot of potatoes, with MICs in the low nanomolar range. Thus, michiganin A may have some potential in biological control of potato ring rot.	1
Title: The grpE protein of Escherichia coli. Purification and properties Abstract: The grpE gene of Escherichia coli was first identified because a mutation in it, grpE280, prevented bacteriophage lambda DNA replication in vivo. Subsequent work resulted in the identification of the grpE protein in two-dimensional gels and its classification as a heat shock protein. Here we report the purification of the grpE protein. We show that overproduction of grpE occurs in dnaK 103 bacteria which do not produce a functional Mr 72,000 dnaK protein. The grpE protein was purified from this strain primarily by its specific retention on a dnaK affinity column. The interaction between these two proteins, which is stable in the presence of 2 M KCl, allowed other proteins to be washed from this column. grpE was then eluted by ATP, which disrupts the interaction. During purification, grpE activity was monitored by its ability to complement an in vitro lambda dv DNA replication system dependent on the lambda O and lambda P proteins. The effect of ATP on the dnaK-grpE complex was also observed during sedimentation of the two proteins in glycerol gradients. Purified grpE protein has a Mr of approximately 23,000 under both denaturing and native conditions, as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and sedimentation, respectively. However, in the presence of dnaK under native conditions, grpE cosediments with dnaK. When ATP is added to the gradient, the complex is disrupted, and the two proteins sediment independently as monomers.	0
Title: Genome mining in Streptomyces avermitilis: cloning and characterization of SAV_76, the synthase for a new sesquiterpene, avermitilol Abstract: The terpene synthase encoded by the sav76 gene of Streptomyces avermtilis was expressed in Escherichia coli as an N-terminal-His(6)-tag protein, using a codon-optimized synthetic gene. Incubation of the recombinant protein, SAV_76, with farnesyl diphosphate (1, FPP) in the presence of Mg(2+) gave a new sesquiterpene alcohol avermitilol (2), whose structure and stereochemistry were determined by a combination of (1)H, (13)C, COSY, HMQC, HMBC, and NOESY NMR, along with minor amounts of germacrene A (3), germacrene B (4), and viridiflorol (5). The absolute configuration of 2 was assigned by (1)H NMR analysis of the corresponding (R)- and (S)-Mosher esters. The steady state kinetic parameters were k(cat) 0.040 +/- 0.001 s(-1) and K(m) 1.06 +/- 0.11 microM. Individual incubations of recombinant avermitilol synthase with [1,1-(2)H(2)]FPP (1a), (1S)-[1-(2)H]-FPP (1b), and (1R)-[1-(2)H]-FPP (1c) and NMR analysis of the resulting avermitilols supported a cyclization mechanism involving the loss of H-1(re) to generate the intermediate bicyclogermacrene (7), which then undergoes proton-initiated anti-Markovnikov cyclization and capture of water to generate 2. A copy of the sav76 gene was reintroduced into S. avermitilis SUKA17, a large deletion mutant from which the genes for the major endogenous secondary metabolites had been removed, and expressed under control of the native S. avermitilis promoter rpsJp (sav4925). The resultant transformants generated avermitilol (2) as well as the derived ketone, avermitilone (8), along with small amounts of 3, 4, and 5. The biochemical function of all four terpene synthases found in the S. avermtilis genome have now been determined.	1
Title: Elucidation of gephyronic acid biosynthetic pathway revealed unexpected SAM-dependent methylations Abstract: Gephyronic acid, a cytostatic polyketide produced by the myxobacterium Cystobacter violaceus Cb vi76, exhibits potent and selective eukaryotic protein synthesis inhibition. Next-generation sequencing of the C. violaceus genome revealed five type I polyketide synthases and post-PKS tailoring enzymes including an O-methyltransferase and a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase. Seven methyltransferase (MT) domains embedded within the PKS subunits were found to install the methyl branches throughout the gephyronic acid skeleton. A rare loading domain from the GNAT superfamily also contains an embedded MT domain that catalyzes the in situ production of an isobutyryl starter unit. Phylogenetic analysis identified new motifs that distinguish MT domains located in PKS pathways with in cis acyltransferase (AT) domains from MT domains located in PKS pathways with trans AT enzymes. The identification of the gene cluster sets the stage for the generation of a heterologous expression system, which will allow further investigation of selective eukaryotic protein synthesis inhibitors through the generation of gephyronic acid analogues.	1
Title: Precursor and temperature modulation of fatty acid composition and growth of Listeria monocytogenes cold-sensitive mutants with transposon-interrupted branched-chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase Abstract: Branched-chain fatty acids (BCFAs) typically constitute more than 90 % of the fatty acids of Listeria monocytogenes. The authors have previously described two Tn917-induced, cold-sensitive, BCFA-deficient (<40 %) L. monocytogenes mutants (cld-1 and cld-2) with lowered membrane fluidity. Sequence analyses revealed that Tn917 was inserted into different genes of the branched-chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase cluster (bkd) in these two mutants. The cold-sensitivity and BCFA deficiency of cld-1, in which Tn917 was inserted into bkdB, were complemented in trans by cloned bkdB. The growth and corresponding BCFA content of the mutants at 37 degrees C were stimulated by fatty acid precursors bypassing Bkd, 2-methylbutyrate (precursor for odd-numbered anteiso-fatty acids), isobutyrate (precursor for even-numbered iso-fatty acids) and isovalerate (precursor for odd-numbered iso-fatty acids). In contrast, the corresponding Bkd substrates, alpha-ketomethylvalerate, alpha-ketoisovalerate and alpha-ketoisocaproate, exhibited much poorer activity. At 26 degrees C, 2-methylbutyrate and isovalerate stimulated the growth of the mutants, and at 10 degrees C, only 2-methylbutyrate stimulated growth. Pyruvate depressed the BCFA content of cld-2 from 33 % to 27 %, which may be close to the minimum BCFA requirement for L. monocytogenes. The transcription of bkd was enhanced by Bkd substrates, but not by low temperature. When provided with the BCFA precursors, cld-2 was able to increase its anteiso-C15 : 0 fatty acid content at 10 degrees C compared to 37 degrees C, which is the characteristic response of L. monocytogenes to low temperature. This implies that Bkd is not the major cold-regulation point of BCFA synthesis.	0
Title: Studies on cephalosporin antibiotics. V. Synthesis, antibacterial activity and oral absorption of new 3-[(Z)-2-methoxycarbonylvinylthio]-7 beta- [(Z)-2-(2-aminothiazol-4-yl)-2-(oxyimino)acetamido]cephalosporins Abstract: A series of new 3-[(Z)-2-methoxycarbonylvinylthio]-7 beta-[(2- aminothiazol-4-yl)acetamido]-cephalosporins (1) having various oxyimino groups (Z-form) at the alpha position of the C-7 side chain was synthesized and evaluated for antibacterial activity and oral absorption in rats. Of these, the cephalosporin (1a) with a hydroxyimino group in the C-7 side chain showed a potent antibacterial activity against Gram-negative bacteria and Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus as well as good oral absorption in rats. The structure-activity relationships of 1 are also presented.	0
Title: Transcriptional organization of a cloned chemotaxis locus of Bacillus subtilis Abstract: A cloned chemotaxis operon has been characterized. Thirteen representative che mutations from different complementation groups were localized on the physical map by recombination experiments. The use of integration plasmids established that at least 10 of these complementation groups within this locus are cotranscribed. An additional three complementation groups may form part of the same transcript. The direction of transcription and the time of expression were determined from chromosomal che-lacZ gene fusions. The promoter was cloned and localized to a 3-kilobase fragment. Expression of beta-galactosidase from this promoter was observed primarily during the logarithmic phase of growth. Three-factor PBS1 cotransduction experiments were performed to order the che locus with respect to adjacent markers. The cheF141 mutation is 70 to 80% linked to pyrD1. This linkage is different from that reported previously (G. W. Ordal, D. O. Nettleton, and J. A. Hoch, J. Bacteriol. 154:1088-1097, 1983). The cheM127 mutation is 57% linked by transformation to spcB3. The gene order determined from all crosses is pyrD-cheF-cheM-spcB.	0
Title: Non-colinear polyketide biosynthesis in the aureothin and neoaureothin pathways: an evolutionary perspective Abstract: Aureothin and neoaureothin (spectinabilin) represent rare nitroaryl-substituted polyketide metabolites from Streptomyces thioluteus and Streptomyces orinoci, respectively, which only differ in the lengths of the polyene backbones. Cloning and sequencing of the 39 kb neoaureothin (nor) biosynthesis gene cluster and its comparison with the aureothin (aur) pathway genes revealed that both polyketide synthase (PKS) assembly lines are remarkably similar. In both cases the module architecture breaks with the principle of colinearity, as individual PKS modules are used in an iterative fashion. Parsimony and neighbour-joining phylogenetic studies provided insights into the evolutionary process that led to the programming of these unusual type I PKS systems and to prediction of which modules act iteratively. The iterative function of the first module in the neoaureothin pathway, NorA, was confirmed by a successful cross-complementation.	1
Title: Characterisation of the paralytic shellfish toxin biosynthesis gene clusters in Anabaena circinalis AWQC131C and Aphanizomenon sp. NH-5 Abstract: Background:                       Saxitoxin and its analogues collectively known as the paralytic shellfish toxins (PSTs) are neurotoxic alkaloids and are the cause of the syndrome named paralytic shellfish poisoning. PSTs are produced by a unique biosynthetic pathway, which involves reactions that are rare in microbial metabolic pathways. Nevertheless, distantly related organisms such as dinoflagellates and cyanobacteria appear to produce these toxins using the same pathway. Hypothesised explanations for such an unusual phylogenetic distribution of this shared uncommon metabolic pathway, include a polyphyletic origin, an involvement of symbiotic bacteria, and horizontal gene transfer.                  Results:                       We describe the identification, annotation and bioinformatic characterisation of the putative paralytic shellfish toxin biosynthesis clusters in an Australian isolate of Anabaena circinalis and an American isolate of Aphanizomenon sp., both members of the Nostocales. These putative PST gene clusters span approximately 28 kb and contain genes coding for the biosynthesis and export of the toxin. A putative insertion/excision site in the Australian Anabaena circinalis AWQC131C was identified, and the organization and evolution of the gene clusters are discussed. A biosynthetic pathway leading to the formation of saxitoxin and its analogues in these organisms is proposed.                  Conclusion:                       The PST biosynthesis gene cluster presents a mosaic structure, whereby genes have apparently transposed in segments of varying size, resulting in different gene arrangements in all three sxt clusters sequenced so far. The gene cluster organizational structure and sequence similarity seems to reflect the phylogeny of the producer organisms, indicating that the gene clusters have an ancient origin, or that their lateral transfer was also an ancient event. The knowledge we gain from the characterisation of the PST biosynthesis gene clusters, including the identity and sequence of the genes involved in the biosynthesis, may also afford the identification of these gene clusters in dinoflagellates, the cause of human mortalities and significant financial loss to the tourism and shellfish industries.	1
Title: Identifying sigma factors in Mycobacterium smegmatis by comparative genomic analysis Abstract: Mycobacterium smegmatis is a saprophytic species that has been used for 15 years as a model to perform heterologous regulation and virulence studies of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Members of the extracytoplasmic sigma factors family, which are required for adaptive responses to various environmental stresses, are responsible for some of the virulence traits of M. tuberculosis. A bioinformatic search on the genome of M. smegmatis has predicted the existence of 26 sigma factors, which is twice the number that are present in M. tuberculosis. A phylogenetic analysis has shown that despite this high number of sigma factors the orthologs of the genes sigC, sigI and sigK of M. tuberculosis are absent in the M. smegmatis genome. Several sigma factors are specific for M. smegmatis, with a special enrichment in the sigH and, to a lesser extent, in the sigJ and sigL subfamily, pinpointing the potential variability of the repertoire of adaptive response in this saprophytic species.	1
Title: A prodrug resistance mechanism is involved in colibactin biosynthesis and cytotoxicity Abstract: Commensal Escherichia coli residing in the human gut produce colibactin, a small-molecule genotoxin of unknown structure that has been implicated in the development of colon cancer. Colibactin biosynthesis is hypothesized to involve a prodrug resistance strategy that entails initiation of biosynthesis via construction of an N-terminal prodrug scaffold and late-stage cleavage of this structural motif during product export. Here we describe the biochemical characterization of the prodrug synthesis, elongation, and cleavage enzymes from the colibactin biosynthetic pathway. We show that nonribosomal peptide synthetases ClbN and ClbB assemble and process an N-acyl-D-asparagine prodrug scaffold that serves as a substrate for the periplasmic D-amino peptidase ClbP. In addition to affording information about structural features of colibactin, this work reveals the biosynthetic logic underlying the prodrug resistance strategy and suggests that cytotoxicity requires amide bond cleavage.	1
Title: FL-120A-D', new products related to kinamycin from Streptomyces chattanoogensis subsp. taitungensis subsp. nov. II. Isolation and structure determination Abstract: Six new kinamycin antibiotics have been isolated from the culture filtrate of Streptomyces chattanoogensis. The structures of six related components were determined employing 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. These structures represent the first reported epoxide kinamycin (2, 3) and propionyl derivative of kinamycin (5), and new isobutyryl derivatives of kinamycin (1, 4, 6).	0
Title: Pressure-tuning the quantum spin Hamiltonian of the triangular lattice antiferromagnet Cs2CuCl4 Abstract: Quantum triangular-lattice antiferromagnets are important prototype systems to investigate numerous phenomena of the geometrical frustration in condensed matter. Apart from highly unusual magnetic properties, they possess a rich phase diagram (ranging from an unfrustrated square lattice to a quantum spin liquid), yet to be confirmed experimentally. One major obstacle in this area of research is the lack of materials with appropriate (ideally tuned) magnetic parameters. Using Cs2CuCl4 as a model system, we demonstrate an alternative approach, where, instead of the chemical composition, the spin Hamiltonian is altered by hydrostatic pressure. The approach combines high-pressure electron spin resonance and r.f. susceptibility measurements, allowing us not only to quasi-continuously tune the exchange parameters, but also to accurately monitor them. Our experiments indicate a substantial increase of the exchange coupling ratio from 0.3 to 0.42 at a pressure of 1.8 GPa, revealing a number of emergent field-induced phases.	0
Title: Characterization of glycoconjugates of extracellular polymeric substances in tufa-associated biofilms by using fluorescence lectin-binding analysis Abstract: Freshwater tufa deposits are the result of calcification associated with biofilms dominated by cyanobacteria. Recent investigations highlighted the fact that the formation of microbial calcium carbonates is mainly dependent on the saturation index, which is determined by pH, the ion activity of Ca(2+) and CO(3)(2-), and the occurrence of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) produced by microorganisms. EPS, which contain carboxyl and/or hydroxyl groups, can strongly bind cations. This may result in inhibition of CaCO(3) precipitation. In contrast, the formation of templates for crystal nucleation was reported by many previous investigations. The purposes of this study were (i) to characterize the in situ distribution of EPS glycoconjugates in tufa-associated biofilms of two German hard-water creeks by employing fluorescence lectin-binding analysis (FLBA), (ii) to verify the specific lectin-binding pattern by competitive-inhibition assays, and (iii) to assess whether carbonates are associated with structural EPS domains. Three major in situ EPS domains (cyanobacterial, network-like, and cloud-like structures) were detected by FLBA in combination with laser scanning microscopy (LSM). Based on lectin specificity, the EPS glycoconjugates produced by cyanobacteria contained mainly fucose, amino sugars (N-acetyl-glucosamine and N-acetyl-galactosamine), and sialic acid. Tufa deposits were irregularly covered by network-like EPS structures, which may originate from cyanobacterial EPS secretions. Cloud-like EPS glycoconjugates were dominated by sialic acid, amino sugars, and galactose. In some cases calcium carbonate crystals were associated with cyanobacterial EPS glycoconjugates. The detection of amino sugars and calcium carbonate in close association with decaying sheath material indicated that microbially mediated processes might be important for calcium carbonate precipitation in freshwater tufa systems.	0
Title: Specific recognition of the blk promoter by the B-lymphoid transcription factor B-cell-specific activator protein Abstract: Several genes of the src family encode protein-tyrosine kinases that associate with the B-cell antigen receptor complex and are activated upon receptor cross-linking, including blk, lyn, and fyn. The blk gene is the only member of this family whose expression is restricted to B-lymphoid cells. In the B lineage, blk is developmentally regulated: blk transcripts are first detected in pro-B-cells and persist until the differentiation of mature B-cells to plasma cells. We have found that the blk promoter is a target for a specific DNA-binding protein whose activity in B-lymphoid cell lines is positively correlated with blk expression. By three criteria, we have identified this DNA-binding protein as the transcription factor B-cell-specific activator protein (BSAP): 1) oligonucleotides containing known BSAP recognition sites were found to compete specifically with blk for binding to the protein detected in B-lymphoid extracts; 2) authentic BSAP was shown to bind the same site within the blk promoter as the protein identified in B-lymphoid extracts; and 3) the specific DNA-protein complex formed in B-lymphoid extracts was shown to react with an anti-BSAP antiserum. BSAP has been implicated previously in the transcriptional regulation of CD19, whose pattern of expression in B-cell development coincides with that of blk. These observations, and the correlation between expression of BSAP and expression of blk, suggest that BSAP is a positive regulator of blk transcription.	0
Title: Supramolecular Assembly of Halide Perovskite Building Blocks Abstract: The structural diversity and tunable optoelectronic properties of halide perovskites originate from the rich chemistry of the metal halide ionic octahedron [MX6]n- (M = Pb2+, Sb3+, Te4+, Sn4+, Pt4+, etc.; X = Cl-, Br-, and I-). The properties of the extended perovskite solids are dictated by the assembly, connectivity, and interaction of these octahedra within the lattice environment. Hence, the ability to manipulate and control the assembly of the octahedral building blocks is paramount for constructing new perovskite materials. Here, we propose a systematic supramolecular strategy for the assembly of [MX6]n- octahedra into a solid extended network. Interaction of alkali metal-bound crown ethers with the [M(IV)X6]2- octahedron resulted in a structurally and optoelectronically tunable "dumbbell" structural unit in solution. Single crystals with diverse packing geometries and symmetries will form as the solid assembly of this new supramolecular building block. This supramolecular assembly route introduces a new general strategy for designing halide perovskite structures with potentially new optoelectronic properties.	0
Title: Ligand recognition by ActR, a TetR-like regulator of actinorhodin export Abstract: TetR-like transcriptional repressors interact with small-molecule ligands to control many facets of prokaryotic biology, including clinical antibiotic resistance. ActR is a TetR-like protein encoded in the biosynthetic gene cluster for the antibiotic actinorhodin and controls the expression of two actinorhodin exporters. We showed previously that actinorhodin and its precursor 4-dihydro-9-hydroxy-1-methyl-10-oxo-3-H-naphtho-[2,3-c]-pyran-3-(S)-acetic acid can bind ActR and prevent its interaction with DNA. Here, we compare ActR's interaction with naturally occurring and synthetic molecules to show that pathway intermediates bind to ActR 5- to 10-fold more tightly than actinorhodin itself, consistent with our suggestion that they are the biologically relevant triggers for actinorhodin export. We also find that the ligand-binding cavity of this protein can accommodate a surprisingly large diversity of ligands, many of which can release ActR from DNA in vitro and in vivo. These data suggest that the actR locus could be activated by, and perhaps adapted to confer resistance to other antibiotics.	1
Title: Structural Insights into a Flavin-Dependent [4 + 2] Cyclase that Catalyzes trans-Decalin Formation in Pyrroindomycin Biosynthesis Abstract: Here, we provide structural insights into PyrE3, a flavin-dependent [4 + 2] cyclase that catalyzes trans-decalin formation in the biosynthesis of pyrroindomycins. PyrE3 shares an architecture/domain organization head-to-tail similarity with the members of the family of para-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase (pHBH)-fold monooxygenases, and possesses a flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD)-binding domain, a middle domain, and a C-terminal thioredoxin-like domain. The FAD-binding domain forms a central hub of the protein structure, and binds with FAD in a "closed" conformation of pHBH-fold family monooxygenases known for their highly dynamic catalytic processes. FAD plays an essential structural role in PyrE3, where it is amenable to redox change; however, redox change has little effect on [4 + 2] cyclization activity. PyrE3 appears to selectively accommodate a tetramate-containing, linear polyene intermediate in a highly positively charged pocket, which is located at the interface between the FAD-binding domain and the middle domain, and can accelerate trans-decalin formation likely through an endo-selective [4 + 2] transition state.	0
Title: Generation of new landomycins with altered saccharide patterns through over-expression of the glycosyltransferase gene lanGT3 in the biosynthetic gene cluster of landomycin A in Streptomyces cyanogenus S-136 Abstract: Two novel landomycin compounds, landomycins I and J, were generated with a new mutant strain of Streptomyces cyanogenus in which the glycosyltransferase that is encoded by lanGT3 was over-expressed. This mutant also produced the known landomycins A, B, and D. All these compounds consist of the same polyketide-derived aglycon but differ in their sugar moieties, which are chains of different lengths. The major new metabolite, landomycin J, was found to consist of landomycinone with a tetrasaccharide chain attached. Combined with previous results of the production of landomycin E (which contains three sugars) by the LanGT3- mutant strain (obtained by targeted gene deletion of lanGT3), it was verified that LanGT3 is a D-olivosyltransferase responsible for the transfer of the fourth sugar required for landomycin A biosynthesis. The experiments also showed that gene over-expression is a powerful method for unbalancing biosynthetic pathways in order to generate new metabolites. The cytotoxicity of the new landomycins--compared to known ones--was assessed by using three different tumor cell lines, and their structure-activity relationship (SAR) with respect to the length of the deoxysugar side chain was deduced from the results.	0
Title: All about that Amide Bond: The Sixth Chemical Protein Synthesis (CPS) Meeting Abstract: Endless potential: The sixth Chemical Protein Synthesis Meeting, held recently in St. Augustine, Florida, showed the potential of peptide and protein chemistry when applied toward understanding and controlling complex biological processes.

Title: Benzodiazepine biosynthesis in Streptomyces refuineus Abstract: Anthramycin is a benzodiazepine alkaloid with potent antitumor and antibiotic activity produced by the thermophilic actinomycete Streptomyces refuineus sbsp. thermotolerans. In this study, the complete 32.5 kb gene cluster for the biosynthesis of anthramycin was identified by using a genome-scanning approach, and cluster boundaries were estimated via comparative genomics. A lambda-RED-mediated gene-replacement system was developed to provide supporting evidence for critical biosynthetic genes and to validate the boundaries of the proposed anthramycin gene cluster. Sequence analysis reveals that the 25 open reading frame anthramycin cluster contains genes consistent with the biosynthesis of the two halves of anthramycin: 4 methyl-3-hydroxyanthranilic acid and a "dehydroproline acrylamide" moiety. These nonproteinogenic amino acid precursors are condensed by a two-module nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) terminated by a reductase domain, consistent with the final hemiaminal oxidation state of anthramycin.	1
Title: Complete biosynthetic pathways of ascofuranone and ascochlorin in Acremonium egyptiacum Abstract: Ascofuranone (AF) and ascochlorin (AC) are meroterpenoids produced by various filamentous fungi, including Acremonium egyptiacum (synonym: Acremonium sclerotigenum), and exhibit diverse physiological activities. In particular, AF is a promising drug candidate against African trypanosomiasis and a potential anticancer lead compound. These compounds are supposedly biosynthesized through farnesylation of orsellinic acid, but the details have not been established. In this study, we present all of the reactions and responsible genes for AF and AC biosyntheses in A. egyptiacum, identified by heterologous expression, in vitro reconstruction, and gene deletion experiments with the aid of a genome-wide differential expression analysis. Both pathways share the common precursor, ilicicolin A epoxide, which is processed by the membrane-bound terpene cyclase (TPC) AscF in AC biosynthesis. AF biosynthesis branches from the precursor by hydroxylation at C-16 by the P450 monooxygenase AscH, followed by cyclization by a membrane-bound TPC AscI. All genes required for AC biosynthesis (ascABCDEFG) and a transcriptional factor (ascR) form a functional gene cluster, whereas those involved in the late steps of AF biosynthesis (ascHIJ) are present in another distantly located cluster. AF is therefore a rare example of fungal secondary metabolites requiring multilocus biosynthetic clusters, which are likely to be controlled by the single regulator, AscR. Finally, we achieved the selective production of AF in A. egyptiacum by genetically blocking the AC biosynthetic pathway; further manipulation of the strain will lead to the cost-effective mass production required for the clinical use of AF.	1
Title: Prochlorococcus ecotype abundances in the North Atlantic Ocean as revealed by an improved quantitative PCR method Abstract: The cyanobacterium Prochlorococcus numerically dominates the photosynthetic community in the tropical and subtropical regions of the world's oceans. Six evolutionary lineages of Prochlorococcus have been described, and their distinctive physiologies and genomes indicate that these lineages are "ecotypes" and should have different oceanic distributions. Two methods recently developed to quantify these ecotypes in the field, probe hybridization and quantitative PCR (QPCR), have shown that this is indeed the case. To facilitate a global investigation of these ecotypes, we modified our QPCR protocol to significantly increase its speed, sensitivity, and accessibility and validated the method in the western and eastern North Atlantic Ocean. We showed that all six ecotypes had distinct distributions that varied with depth and location, and, with the exception of the deeper waters at the western North Atlantic site, the total Prochlorococcus counts determined by QPCR matched the total counts measured by flow cytometry. Clone library analyses of the deeper western North Atlantic waters revealed ecotypes that are not represented in the culture collections with which the QPCR primers were designed, explaining this discrepancy. Finally, similar patterns of relative ecotype abundance were obtained in QPCR and probe hybridization analyses of the same field samples, which could allow comparisons between studies.	0
Title: An in situ directing group strategy for chiral anion phase-transfer fluorination of allylic alcohols Abstract: An enantioselective fluorination of allylic alcohols under chiral anion phase-transfer conditions is reported. The in situ generation of a directing group proved crucial for achieving effective enantiocontrol. In the presence of such a directing group, a range of acyclic substrates underwent fluorination to afford highly enantioenriched α-fluoro homoallylic alcohols. Mechanistic studies suggest that this transformation proceeds through a concerted enantiodetermining transition state involving both C-F bond formation and C-H bond cleavage.	0
Title: Characterization of a gene cluster of Staphylococcus warneri ISK-1 encoding the biosynthesis of and immunity to the lantibiotic, nukacin ISK-1 Abstract: We characterized a gene cluster in a plasmid designated pPI-1 of Staphylococcus warneri ISK-1 encoding the biosynthesis of and immunity to the lacticin-481 type lantibiotic, nukacin ISK-1. The DNA sequence suggested that the nukacin ISK-1 gene cluster consists of at least six genes, nukA (a structural gene), -M, -T, -F, -E, -G, and two open reading frames, ORF1 and ORF7. NukM and NukT were predicted to be involved in post-translational modification and secretion of nukacin ISK-1 respectively. NukF, -E, and -G were predicted to form a membrane complex which contributes to self-protection from nukacin ISK-1. Transcriptional analyses revealed that nukM through ORF7 comprises an operon, and that ORF1 is transcribed independently from downstream of nukA. The transcriptional levels of the nukA and nukM genes were enhanced by osmotic stress. The expression level of the nukA transcript was scarcely enhanced by nukacin ISK-1, suggesting that expression is not under the control of the autoregulatory circuit.	1
Title: Rational design of matrix metalloproteinase-13 activatable probes for enhanced specificity Abstract: Because of the important roles that matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) play in tumor invasion and metastasis, various activatable optical probes have been developed to visualize MMP activities in vitro and in vivo. Our recently developed MMP-13 activatable probe, l-MMP-P12, has been successfully applied to image the expression and inhibition of MMPs in a xenografted tumor model [Zhu, L., et al. (2011) Theranostics 1, 18-27]. In this study, to further optimize the in vivo behavior of the proteinase activatable probe, we tracked and profiled the metabolites by a high-resolution liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) system. Two major metabolites that contributed to the fluorescence recovery were identified. One was specifically cleaved between glycine (G(4)) and valine (V(5)) by MMP, while the other one was generated by nonspecific cleavage between glycine (G(7)) and lysine (K(8)). To visualize the MMP activity more accurately and specifically, a new probe, D-MMP-P12, was designed by replacing the l-lysine with d-lysine in the MMP substrate sequence. The metabolic profile of the new probe, D-MMP-P12, was further characterized by in vitro enzymatic assay, and no nonspecific metabolite was found by LC-MS. Our in vivo optical imaging also demonstrated that D-MMP-P12 had a tumor-to-background ratio (TBR, 5.55 ± 0.75) significantly higher than that of L-MMP-P12 (3.73 ± 0.31) 2 h postinjection. The improved MMP activatable probe may have the potential for drug screening, tumor diagnosis, and therapy response monitoring. Moreover, our research strategy can be further extended to study other protease activatable probes.	0
Title: Exploration of solid-state nanopores in characterizing reaction mixtures generated from a catalytic DNA assembly circuit Abstract: Recent advances have proven that using solid-state nanopores is a promising single molecular technique to enrich the DNA assembly signaling library. Other than using them for distinguishing structures, here we innovatively adapt solid-state nanopores for use in analyzing assembly mixtures, which is usually a tougher task for either traditional characterization techniques or nanopores themselves. A trigger induced DNA step polymerization (SP-CHA), producing three-way-DNA concatemers, is designed as a model. Through counting and integrating the translocation-induced current block when each concatemer passes through a glass conical glass nanopore, we propose an electrophoresis-gel like, but homogeneous, quantitative method that can comprehensively profile the "base-pair distribution" of SP-CHA concatemer mixtures. Due to the higher sensitivity, a number of super long concatemers that were previously difficult to detect via gel electrophoresis are also revealed. These ultra-concatemers, longer than 2 kbp, could provide a much enhanced signal-to-noise ratio for nanopores and are thus believed to be more accurate indicators for the existence of a trigger, which may be of benefit for further applications, such as molecular machines or biosensors.	0
Title: A Genetically Encoded FRET Sensor for Hypoxia and Prolyl Hydroxylases Abstract: Oxygen is vital for all aerobic life forms. Oxygen-dependent hydroxylation of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1α by prolyl hydroxylase domain enzymes (PHDs) is an important step for controlling the expression of oxygen-regulated genes in metazoan species, thereby constituting a molecular mechanism for oxygen sensing and response. Herein, we report a genetically encoded dual-emission ratiometric fluorescent sensor, ProCY, which responds to PHD activities in vitro and in live cells. We demonstrated that ProCY could monitor hypoxia in mammalian cells. By targeting this novel genetically encoded biosensor to the cell nucleus and cytosol, we determined that, under normoxic conditions, the HIF-prolyl hydroxylase activity was mainly confined to the cytosol of HEK 293T cells. The results collectively suggest broad applications of ProCY on the evaluation of hypoxia and PHD activities and understanding of pathways for the control of hypoxic responses.	0
Title: The role of heterologous receptors in McpB-mediated signalling in Bacillus subtilis chemotaxis Abstract: Asparagine chemotaxis in Bacillus subtilis appears to involve two partially redundant adaptation mechanisms: a receptor methylation-independent process that operates at low attractant concentrations and a receptor methylation-dependent process that is required for optimal responses to high concentrations. In order to elucidate these processes, chemotactic responses were assessed for strains expressing methylation-defective mutations in the asparagine receptor, McpB, in which all 10 putative receptors (10del), five receptors (5del) or only the native copy of mcpB were deleted. This was done in both the presence and the absence of the methylesterase CheB. We found that: (i) only responses to high concentrations of asparagine were impaired; (ii) the presence of all heterologous receptors fully compensated for this defect, whereas responses progressively worsened as more receptors were taken away; (iii) methyl-group turnover occurred on heterologous receptors after the addition of asparagine, and these methylation changes were required for the restoration of normal swimming behaviour; (iv) in the absence of the methyleste-rase, the presence of heterologous receptors in some cases caused impaired chemotaxis; and (v) either a certain threshold number of receptors must be present to promote basal CheA activity, or one or more of the receptors missing in the 10del background (but present in the 5del background) is required for establishing basal CheA activity. Taken together, these findings suggest that many or all chemoreceptors work as an ensemble that constitutes a robust chemotaxis system. We propose that the ability of non-McpB receptors to compensate for the methylation-defective McpB mutations involves lateral transmission of the adapted conformational change across the ensemble.	0
Title: Nucleotide sequence, transcription and deduced function of a gene involved in polyketide antibiotic synthesis in Streptomyces coelicolor Abstract: The BamHI fragment containing the actIII gene, from the actinorhodin (Act) biosynthetic gene cluster of Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2), was sequenced. The derived amino acid sequence for the actIII gene shows homology to known oxidoreductases and the actIII product is believed to be responsible for catalysing a beta-keto reductive step during assembly of the Act polyketide chain. High resolution transcript mapping identified the transcription start point at 33 nucleotides upstream of the putative translation start codon. The transcript ends in a large invertedly repeated sequence. In vivo promoter-probe studies suggest that efficient transcription of the actIII gene requires the product of the actII gene.	1
Title: Differentiation of epidemic-associated strains of Listeria monocytogenes by restriction fragment length polymorphism in a gene region essential for growth at low temperatures (4 degrees C) Abstract: The growth of Listeria monocytogenes in food stored in the cold has often been implicated in outbreaks of listeriosis. Many subtyping schemes have suggested that epidemic-associated strains belong to a unique genetic group. It has not yet been possible, however, to identify molecular or bacteriologic markers unique to epidemic-associated strains. Recently we cloned three genes of L. monocytogenes, ltrA, ltrB, and ltrC, which are essential for growth at low temperatures (4 degrees C). The use of a 1.2-kb PstI fragment derived from ltrB as a probe in Southern blots of HindIII-digested DNA revealed three hybridization patterns: the first (a 5.0-kb band) was observed in strains of serotypes 4b, 1/2b, and 3b; the second (a 3.1-kb band) was seen in strains of serotypes 1/2a, 3a, 1/2c, and 3c; and the third (a 9.5-kb band) was characteristic of epidemic-associated serotype 4b strains. These and other data suggest that probes derived from this gene region that is essential for growth at low temperatures can be useful molecular tools for the subtyping of strains implicated in food-borne listeriosis.	0
Title: Fluorescence imaging of single-copy DNA sequences within the human genome using PNA-directed padlock probe assembly Abstract: We present an approach for fluorescent in situ detection of short, single-copy sequences within genomic DNA in human cells. The single-copy sensitivity and single-base specificity of our method is achieved due to the combination of three components. First, a peptide nucleic acid (PNA) probe locally opens a chosen target site, which allows a padlock DNA probe to access the site and become ligated. Second, rolling circle amplification (RCA) generates thousands of single-stranded copies of the target sequence. Finally, fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) is used to visualize the amplified DNA. We validate this technique by successfully detecting six single-copy target sites on human mitochondrial and autosomal DNA. We also demonstrate the high selectivity of this method by detecting X- and Y-specific sequences on human sex chromosomes and by simultaneously detecting three sequence-specific target sites. Finally, we discriminate two target sites that differ by 2 nt. The PNA-RCA-FISH approach is a distinctive in situ hybridization method capable of multitarget visualization within human chromosomes and nuclei that does not require DNA denaturation and is extremely sequence specific.	0
Title: Immunoglobulin heavy chain gene rearrangement and transcription in murine T cell hybrids and T lymphomas Abstract: We have examined the arrangement of immunoglobulin heavy chain constant (CH) and joining (JH) region genes in murine T cell hybrid lines and in T lymphomas. CH genes derived from both parental cell types were present in all hybrids for which polymorphism in sequences flanking CH genes permitted us to distinguish parental CH genes. All T lymphomas and T cell hybrids retained the C alpha gene in germ-line configuration and all but one cell line had germ-line C mu genes. Novel DNA fragments reactive with JH probes were observed in six of nine T cell hybrids, as well as in two T lymphomas, WEHI7.1 and YAC-1, but not in the fusion parent, BW5147. No RNA homologous to C gamma 2b, C alpha, or lambda genes was detected in any of the T cell lines. T cell lines contained poly(A)+ RNA homologous to a C mu cDNA probe. More importantly, in several cell lines the C mu RNAs were associated with membrane-bound polyribosomes. These results suggest that both JH rearrangements and C mu RNA production occur in at least some mature, antigen-specific T cells. They may therefore reflect events in normal T cell development and function related to those involved in the generation of the T receptor for antigen.	0
Title: Low-diversity bacterial community in the gut of the fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster Abstract: The bacteria in the fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster of different life stages was quantified by 454 pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA gene amplicons. The sequence reads were dominated by 5 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) at ≤ 97% sequence identity that could be assigned to Acetobacter pomorum, A. tropicalis, Lactobacillus brevis, L. fructivorans and L. plantarum. The saturated rarefaction curves and species richness indices indicated that the sampling (85,000-159,000 reads per sample) was comprehensive. Parallel diagnostic PCR assays revealed only minor variation in the complement of the five bacterial species across individual insects and three D. melanogaster strains. Other gut-associated bacteria included 6 OTUs with low %ID to previously reported sequences, raising the possibility that they represent novel taxa within the genera Acetobacter and Lactobacillus. A developmental change in the most abundant species, from L. fructivorans in young adults to A. pomorum in aged adults was identified; changes in gut oxygen tension or immune system function might account for this effect. Host immune responses and disturbance may also contribute to the low bacterial diversity in the Drosophila gut habitat.	0
Title: Activity-Based Protein Profiling Identifies α-Ketoamides as Inhibitors for Phospholipase A2 Group XVI Abstract: Phospholipase A2, group XVI (PLA2G16) is a thiol hydrolase from the HRASLS family that regulates lipolysis in adipose tissue and has been identified as a host factor enabling the cellular entry of picornaviruses. Chemical tools are essential to visualize and control PLA2G16 activity, but they have not been reported to date. Here, we show that MB064, which is a fluorescent lipase probe, also labels recombinant and endogenously expressed PLA2G16. Competitive activity-based protein profiling (ABPP) using MB064 enabled the discovery of α-ketoamides as the first selective PLA2G16 inhibitors. LEI110 was identified as a potent PLA2G16 inhibitor ( Ki = 20 nM) that reduces cellular arachidonic acid levels and oleic acid-induced lipolysis in human HepG2 cells. Gel-based ABPP and chemical proteomics showed that LEI110 is a selective pan-inhibitor of the HRASLS family of thiol hydrolases (i.e., PLA2G16, HRASLS2, RARRES3 and iNAT). Molecular dynamic simulations of LEI110 in the reported crystal structure of PLA2G16 provided insight in the potential ligand-protein interactions to explain its binding mode. In conclusion, we have developed the first selective inhibitor that can be used to study the cellular role of PLA2G16.	0
Title: Alternative chiral thiols for preparation of chiral CdS quantum dots covered immediately by achiral thiols Abstract: Developing of alternative chiral thiol stabilizers from the assembly of achiral thiol (e.g. thioglycolic acid) and chiral ligand (e.g. arginine) via both hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions was proposed and successfully applied to an efficient preparation of chiral CdS quantum dots (QDs). Chiral CdS QDs capped mainly with achiral thioglycolic acid were also obtained that may allow the chiral QDs to be modified for extended applications.	0
Title: Proposal to create subspecies of Rickettsia conorii based on multi-locus sequence typing and an emended description of Rickettsia conorii Abstract: Background:                       Rickettsiae closely related to the Malish strain, the reference Rickettsia conorii strain, include Indian tick typhus rickettsia (ITTR), Israeli spotted fever rickettsia (ISFR), and Astrakhan fever rickettsia (AFR). Although closely related genotypically, they are distinct serotypically. Using multilocus sequence typing (MLST), we have recently found that distinct serotypes may not always represent distinct species within the Rickettsia genus. We investigated the possibility of classifying rickettsiae closely related to R. conorii as R. conorii subspecies as proposed by the ad hoc committee on reconciliation of approaches to bacterial systematics. For this, we first estimated their genotypic variability by using MLST including the sequencing of 5 genes, of 31 rickettsial isolates closely related to R. conorii strain Malish, 1 ITTR isolate, 2 isolates and 3 tick amplicons of AFR, and 2 ISFR isolates. Then, we selected a representative of each MLST genotype and used multi-spacer typing (MST) and mouse serotyping to estimate their degree of taxonomic relatedness.                  Results:                       Among the 39 isolates or tick amplicons studied, four MLST genotypes were identified: i) the Malish type; ii) the ITTR type; iii) the AFR type; and iv) the ISFR type. Among these four MLST genotypes, the pairwise similarity in nucleotide sequence varied from 99.8 to 100%, 99.4 to 100%, 98.2 to 99.8%, 98.4 to 99.8%, and 99.2 to 99.9% for 16S rDNA, gltA, ompA, ompB, and sca4 genes, respectively. Representatives of the 4 MLST types were also classified within four types using MST genotyping as well as mouse serotyping.                  Conclusion:                       Although homogeneous genotypically, strains within the R. conorii species show MST genotypic, serotypic, and epidemio-clinical dissimilarities. We, therefore, propose to modify the nomenclature of the R. conorii species through the creation of subspecies. We propose the names R. conorii subsp. conorii subsp. nov. (type strain = Malish, ATCC VR-613), R. conorii subspecies indica subsp. nov. (type strain = ATCC VR-597), R. conorii subspecies caspia subsp. nov. (type strain = A-167), and R. conorii subspecies israelensis subsp. nov. (type strain = ISTT CDC1). The description of R. conorii is emended to accomodate the four subspecies.	0
Title: Functionalization of Styrenes by Copper-Catalyzed Borylation/ ortho-Cyanation and Silver-Catalyzed Annulation Processes Abstract: An efficient two-step method for the assembly of indanone derivatives starting from a simple vinyl arene has been developed. The sequence first involves addition of bis(pinacolato)diboron (B2 pin2 ) and N-cyano-N-phenyl-p-methylbenzenesulfonamide (NCTS) to a broad range of styrenes by utilizing IMesCuCl as catalyst. This step simultaneously accomplishes hydroboration of the alkene and ortho cyanation of the benzene unit. The products thus obtained are further functionalized by a AgNO3 /Selectfluor-mediated coupling of the BPin and cyano functionalities to annulate a new five-membered ring. This combined two-step sequence provides a versatile method for the site-selective derivatization of a broad range of vinyl arene substrates.	0
Title: The role of the TetR-family transcriptional regulator Aur1R in negative regulation of the auricin gene cluster in Streptomyces aureofaciens CCM 3239 Abstract: Two regulatory genes, aur1P and aur1R, have been previously identified upstream of the aur1 polyketide gene cluster involved in biosynthesis of the angucycline-like antibiotic auricin in Streptomyces aureofaciens CCM 3239. The aur1P gene encodes a protein similar to the response regulators of bacterial two-component signal transduction systems and has been shown to specifically activate expression of the auricin biosynthetic genes. The aur1R gene encodes a protein homologous to transcriptional repressors of the TetR family. Here we describe the characterization of the aur1R gene. Expression of the gene is directed by a single promoter, aur1Rp, which is induced just before stationary phase. Disruption of aur1R in S. aureofaciens CCM 3239 had no effect on growth and differentiation. However, the disrupted strain produced more auricin than its parental wild-type S. aureofaciens CCM 3239 strain. Transcription from the aur1Ap and aur1Pp promoters, directing expression of the first biosynthetic gene in the auricin gene cluster and the pathway-specific transcriptional activator, respectively, was increased in the S. aureofaciens CCM 3239 aur1R mutant strain. However, Aur1R was shown to bind specifically only to the aur1Pp promoter in vitro. This binding was abolished by the addition of auricin and/or its intermediates. The results indicate that the Aur1R regulator specifically represses expression of the aur1P gene, which encodes a pathway-specific activator of the auricin biosynthetic gene cluster in S. aureofaciens CCM 3239, and that this repression is relieved by auricin or its intermediates.	1
Title: Structural Properties and Catalytic Implications of the SPASM Domain Iron-Sulfur Clusters in Methylorubrum extorquens PqqE Abstract: Understanding the relationship between the metallocofactor and its protein environment is the key to uncovering the mechanism of metalloenzymes. PqqE, a radical S-adenosylmethionine enzyme in pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) biosynthesis, contains three iron-sulfur cluster binding sites. Two auxiliary iron-sulfur cluster binding sites, designated as AuxI and AuxII, use distinctive ligands compared to other proteins in the family while their functions remain unclear. Here, we investigate the electronic properties of these iron-sulfur clusters and compare the catalytic efficiency of wild-type (WT) Methylorubrum extorquens AM1 PqqE to a range of mutated constructs. Using native mass spectrometry, protein film electrochemistry, and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, we confirm the previously proposed incorporation of a mixture of [2Fe-2S] and [4Fe-4S] clusters at the AuxI site and are able to assign redox potentials to each of the three iron-sulfur clusters. Significantly, a conservative mutation at AuxI, C268H, shown to selectively incorporate a [4Fe-4S] cluster, catalyzes an enhancement of uncoupled S-adenosylmethionine cleavage relative to WT, together with the elimination of detectable peptide cross-linked product. While a [4Fe-4S] cluster can be tolerated at the AuxI site, the aggregate findings suggest a functional [2Fe-2S] configuration within the AuxI site. PqqE variants with nondestructive ligand replacements at AuxII also show that the reduction potential at this site can be manipulated by changing the electronegativity of the unique aspartate ligand. A number of novel mechanistic features are proposed based on the kinetic and spectroscopic data. Additionally, bioinformatic analyses suggest that the unique ligand environment of PqqE may be relevant to its role in PQQ biosynthesis within an oxygen-dependent biosynthetic pathway.	0
Title: mmannot: How to improve small-RNA annotation? Abstract: High-throughput sequencing makes it possible to provide the genome-wide distribution of small non coding RNAs in a single experiment, and contributed greatly to the identification and understanding of these RNAs in the last decade. Small non coding RNAs gather a wide collection of classes, such as microRNAs, tRNA-derived fragments, small nucleolar RNAs and small nuclear RNAs, to name a few. As usual in RNA-seq studies, the sequencing step is followed by a feature quantification step: when a genome is available, the reads are aligned to the genome, their genomic positions are compared to the already available annotations, and the corresponding features are quantified. However, problem arises when many reads map at several positions and while different strategies exist to circumvent this problem, all of them are biased. In this article, we present a new strategy that compares all the reads that map at several positions, and their annotations when available. In many cases, all the hits co-localize with the same feature annotation (a duplicated miRNA or a duplicated gene, for instance). When different annotations exist for a given read, we propose to merge existing features and provide the counts for the merged features. This new strategy has been implemented in a tool, mmannot, freely available at https://github.com/mzytnicki/mmannot.	0
Title: Fast and Efficient Separation of Eleven Mycosporine-like Amino Acids by UHPLC-DAD and Their Quantification in Diverse Red Algae Abstract: Due to their hostile habitats, characterized by a high exposure to UV-A and UV-B radiation, red algae are known to synthesize unique secondary metabolites: mycosporine-like amino acids (MAAs). These small molecules possess an extremely high UV absorption capacity and therefore mainly act as photoprotective agents. In this study, the first ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) method with diode-array detection (DAD) was developed for the determination of eleven MAAs in various algal species. All of the analytes could be separated in under 8 min on a Phenomenex Luna Omega C18 1.6 µm column. The mobile phase comprised water with 0.25% formic acid and 20 mM ammonium formate (A) and acetonitrile (B). Elution was carried out in gradient mode. Method validation following ICH guidelines confirmed excellent linearity (R2 ≥ 0.9998), selectivity, precision and accuracy (from 97.41 to 103.38%) for all analytes. The assay's LOD was always 0.01 µg/mL; its LOQ was not higher than 0.04 µg/mL. Practical applicability was assured by analyzing several algae (e.g., Gracilaria chilensis, Pyropia plicata) using the developed method, and results indicated a high variation in MAA profiles as well as content. Whilst some MAAs were only found in specific samples, shinorine, which was always present, occurred in concentrations from 0.05 to 4.14 mg/g of dried biomass. As UHPLC-MS was also feasible, this method showed high flexibility concerning the detection mode, surpassing established procedures for MAA analysis not only concerning separation efficiency and analysis time.	0
Title: Ligand-Enabled Stereoselective β-C(sp(3))-H Fluorination: Synthesis of Unnatural Enantiopure anti-β-Fluoro-α-amino Acids Abstract: A quinoline-based ligand was shown to promote palladium-catalyzed β-C(sp(3))-H fluorination for the first time. A range of unnatural enantiopure fluorinated α-amino acids were obtained through sequential β-C(sp(3))-H arylation and subsequent stereoselective fluorination from readily available L-alanine.	0
Title: Predicting Transcriptional Output of Synthetic Multi-input Promoters Abstract: Recent advances in synthetic biology have led to a wealth of well-characterized genetic parts. As parts libraries grow, so too does the potential to create novel multi-input promoters that integrate disparate signals to determine transcriptional output. Our ability to construct such promoters will outpace our ability to characterize promoter performance, due to the vast number of input combinations. In this study, we examine the input-output relations of recently developed synthetic multi-input promoters and describe two methods for predicting their behavior. The first method uses 1-dimensional induction data obtained from experiments on single-input systems to predict the n-dimensional induction responses of systems with n inputs. We demonstrate that this approach accurately predicts Boolean (on/off) responses of multi-input systems consisting of novel chimeric transcription factors and hybrid promoters in Escherichia coli. The second method uses only a small amount of multi-input response data to accurately predict analog system response over the entire landscape of input combinations. Taken together, these methods facilitate the design of synthetic circuits that utilize multi-input promoters.	0
Title: Light-induced nuclear export reveals rapid dynamics of epigenetic modifications Abstract: We engineered a photoactivatable system for rapidly and reversibly exporting proteins from the nucleus by embedding a nuclear export signal in the LOV2 domain from phototropin 1. Fusing the chromatin modifier Bre1 to the photoswitch, we achieved light-dependent control of histone H2B monoubiquitylation in yeast, revealing fast turnover of the ubiquitin mark. Moreover, this inducible system allowed us to dynamically monitor the status of epigenetic modifications dependent on H2B ubiquitylation.	0
Title: Natural combinatorial peptide libraries in cyanobacterial symbionts of marine ascidians Abstract: A large family of cytotoxic cyclic peptides exemplified by the patellamides has been isolated from ascidians harboring the obligate cyanobacterial symbionts Prochloron spp.. Genome sequence analysis of these symbionts has revealed that Prochloron spp. synthesize patellamides by a ribosomal pathway. To understand how this pathway evolved to produce a suite of related metabolites, we analyzed 46 prochloron-containing ascidians from the tropical Pacific Ocean for the presence of patellamide biosynthetic genes and taxonomic markers. Here, we show that Prochloron spp. generate a diverse library of patellamides using small, hypervariable cassettes within a conserved genetic background. Each symbiont strain contains a single pathway, and mixtures of symbionts within ascidians lead to the accumulation of chemical libraries. We used this information to engineer the production of a new cyclic peptide in Escherichia coli, thereby demonstrating the power of comparative analysis of closely related symbiotic pathways to direct the genetic synthesis of new molecules.	1
Title: Isolation, characterization, and heterologous expression of the biosynthesis gene cluster for the antitumor anthracycline steffimycin Abstract: The biosynthetic gene cluster for the aromatic polyketide steffimycin of the anthracycline family has been cloned and characterized from "Streptomyces steffisburgensis" NRRL 3193. Sequence analysis of a 42.8-kbp DNA region revealed the presence of 36 open reading frames (ORFs) (one of them incomplete), 24 of which, spanning 26.5 kb, are probably involved in steffimycin biosynthesis. They code for all the activities required for polyketide biosynthesis, tailoring, regulation, and resistance but show no evidence of genes involved in L-rhamnose biosynthesis. The involvement of the cluster in steffimycin biosynthesis was confirmed by expression of a region of about 15 kb containing 15 ORFS, 11 of them forming part of the cluster, in the heterologous host Streptomyces albus, allowing the isolation of a biosynthetic intermediate. In addition, the expression in S. albus of the entire cluster, contained in a region of 34.8 kb, combined with the expression of plasmid pRHAM, directing the biosynthesis of L-rhamnose, led to the production of steffimycin. Inactivation of the stfX gene, coding for a putative cyclase, revealed that this enzymatic activity participates in the cyclization of the fourth ring, making the final steps in the biosynthesis of the steffimycin aglycon similar to those in the biosynthesis of jadomycin or rabelomycin. Inactivation of the stfG gene, coding for a putative glycosyltransferase involved in the attachment of L-rhamnose, allowed the production of a new compound corresponding to the steffimycin aglycon compound also observed in S. albus upon expression of the entire cluster.	1
Title: Expression of the platencin biosynthetic gene cluster in heterologous hosts yielding new platencin congeners Abstract: Platensimycin (PTM) and platencin (PTN) are potent and selective inhibitors of bacterial and mammalian fatty acid synthases and have emerged as promising drug leads for both antibacterial and antidiabetic therapies. We have previously cloned and sequenced the PTM-PTN dual biosynthetic gene cluster from Streptomyces platensis MA7327 and the PTN biosynthetic gene cluster from S. platensis MA7339, the latter of which is composed of 31 genes encoding PTN biosynthesis, regulation, and resistance. We have also demonstrated that PTM or PTN production can be significantly improved upon inactivation of the pathway-specific regulator ptmR1 or ptnR1 in S. platensis MA7327 or MA7339, respectively. We now report engineered production of PTN and congeners in a heterologous Streptomyces host. Expression constructs containing the ptn biosynthetic gene cluster were engineered from SuperCos 1 library clones and introduced into five model Streptomyces hosts, and PTN production was achieved in Streptomyces lividans K4-114. Inactivation of ptnR1 was crucial for expression of the ptn biosynthetic gene cluster, thereby PTN production, in S. lividans K4-114. Six PTN congeners, five of which were new, were also isolated from the recombinant strain S. lividans SB12606, revealing new insights into PTN biosynthesis. Production of PTN in a model Streptomyces host provides new opportunities to apply combinatorial biosynthetic strategies to the PTN biosynthetic machinery for structural diversity.	1
Title: Genes involved in formation and attachment of a two-carbon chain as a component of eurekanate, a branched-chain sugar moiety of avilamycin A Abstract: Eurekanate belongs to the important class of branched-chain carbohydrates present in a wide variety of natural sources. It is a component of avilamycin A, a potent inhibitor of bacterial protein synthesis targeting the 50S ribosomal subunit. The present work provides experimental proof for the function of two genes of the avilamycin biosynthetic gene cluster, aviB1 and aviO2, that are both involved in avilamycin structure modification. The functions of both genes were identified by gene inactivation experiments and nuclear magnetic resonance analyses of extracts produced by the mutants. We suggest that both AviO2 and AviB1 are involved in the biosynthesis of eurekanate within avilamycin biosynthesis. Moreover, two other genes (aviO1 and aviO3) have been inactivated, resulting in a breakdown of avilamycin production in the mutants ITO1 and ITO3, which clearly shows the essential role of both enzymes in avilamycin biosynthesis. The exact functions of both aviO1 and aviO3 remained unknown.	1
Title: Use of anti-idiotypic antibodies to identify a receptor for the T-cell I-J determinant Abstract: In order to identify the molecule(s) interacting with the I-J determinant on suppressor T cells, we have generated two anti-idiotypic sera: one to monoclonal anti-I-Jd antibody and one to monoclonal anti-I-Jk antibody. These antisera specifically block suppressor T-cell function in a genetically restricted manner and have no effect on helper T-cell activation. Both recognize a marker on primary monocytes and B cells but not on T cells. A myeloma cell line bearing this marker has been identified. Therefore, these antisera may recognize a molecule on cells interacting with suppressor T cells that is involved in mediating suppressor T-cell activity. The relationship between the T-cell I-J determinant and the molecule identified by the anti-idiotype may be similar to the relationship between the receptor on helper T cells and Ia molecules.	0
Title: Tet-on, or Tet-off, that is the question: Advanced conditional gene expression in Aspergillus Abstract: In Aspergillus, controlled gene expression is often achieved using the reverse tetracycline-controlled transactivator (rtTA) dependent Tet-on system, whereby transcription is activated in a titratable manner by addition of the tetracycline derivative doxycycline. The complementary Tet-off system utilises the tetracycline-controlled transactivator (tTA) component to quantitatively reduce gene expression. In this study, we utilised a synthetic biological approach to engineer highly optimised Tet-off conditional expression systems in Aspergillus niger and Aspergillus fumigatus. Steps for delivery of these tools include utilising codon optimised cassette components, testing several promoters for improved genetic stability and validating two modified luciferase reporters for highly accurate measurements of gene expression. The Tet-off cassettes developed in this study enable facile and quantitative functional analysis, as validated by Tet-off analysis of genes involved in chitin synthesis and cell wall polarity in A. niger, and para-aminobenzoic acid synthesis in A. fumigatus. We also used a racA(G18V) dominant allele to demonstrate that Tet-off in A. niger enables gene over-expression and downregulation in a single isolate. Additionally, we used the improved luciferase reporters to show that the Tet-off cassette in A. niger enables quantification of gene oscillations. In order to demonstrate that synthetic biological approaches developed here are broadly applicable to engineering transcriptional circuits in filamentous fungi, we used our strategy for improving cassette stability by promoter replacement in the A. niger Tet-on system, which resulted in a modified Tet-on cassette with higher stability in recipient genomes.	0
Title: Characterization of the diastaphenazine/izumiphenazine C biosynthetic gene cluster from plant endophyte Streptomyces diastaticus W2 Abstract: Two phenazine compounds, diastaphenazine and izumiphenazine C, with complex structures and promising antitumour activity have been isolated from the plant endophytic actinomycete Streptomyces diastaticus W2. Their putative biosynthetic gene cluster (dap) was identified by heterologous expression and gene knockout. There are twenty genes in the dap cluster. dap14-19 related to shikimic pathway were potentially involved in the precursor chorismic acid biosynthesis, and dapBCDEFG were confirmed to be responsible for the biosynthesis of the dibenzopyrazine ring, the nuclear structure of phenazines. Two transcriptional regulatory genes dapR and dap4 played the positive regulatory roles on the phenazine biosynthetic pathway. Most notably, the dimerization of the dibenzopyrazine ring in diastaphenazine and the loading of the complex side chain in izumiphenazine C could be catalysed by the cyclase homologous gene dap5, suggesting an unusual modification strategy tailoring complex phenazine biosynthesis. Moreover, metabolite analysis of the gene deletion mutant strain S. albus::23C5Δdap2 and substrate assay of the methyltransferase Dap2 clearly revealed the biosynthetic route of the complex side chain in izumiphenazine C.	1
Title: Expanding the Bioactive Chemical Space of Anthrabenzoxocinones through Engineering the Highly Promiscuous Biosynthetic Modification Steps Abstract: Anthrabenzoxocinones (ABXs) including (-)-ABXs and (+)-ABXs are a group of bacterial FabF-specific inhibitors with potent antimicrobial activity of resistant strains. Optimization of their chemical structures is a promising method to develop potent antibiotics. Through biosynthetic investigation, we herein identified and characterized two highly promiscuous enzymes involved in the (-)-ABX structural modification. The promiscuous halogenase and methyltransferase can respectively introduce halogen-modifications into various positions of the ABX scaffolds and methylation to highly diverse substrates. Manipulation of their activity in both of the (-)-ABXs and (+)-ABXs biosyntheses led to the generation of 14 novel ABX analogues of both enantiomers. Bioactivity assessment revealed that a few of the analogues showed significantly improved antimicrobial activity, with the C3-hydroxyl and chlorine substitutions critical for their activity. This study enormously expands the bioactive chemical space of the ABX family and FabF-specific inhibitors. The disclosed broad-selective biosynthetic machineries and structure-activity relationship provide a solid basis for further generation of potent antimicrobial agents.	1
Title: Enantioselective Decarboxylative Arylation of α-Amino Acids via the Merger of Photoredox and Nickel Catalysis Abstract: An asymmetric decarboxylative Csp(3)-Csp(2) cross-coupling has been achieved via the synergistic merger of photoredox and nickel catalysis. This mild, operationally simple protocol transforms a wide variety of naturally abundant α-amino acids and readily available aryl halides into valuable chiral benzylic amines in high enantiomeric excess, thereby producing motifs found in pharmacologically active agents.	0
Title: Cryogenic Focused Ion Beam Enables Atomic-Resolution Imaging of Local Structures in Highly Sensitive Bulk Crystals and Devices Abstract: With the development of ultralow-dose (scanning) transmission electron microscopy ((S)TEM) techniques, atomic-resolution imaging of highly sensitive nanomaterials has recently become possible. However, applying these techniques to the study of sensitive bulk materials remains challenging due to the lack of suitable specimen preparation methods. We report that cryogenic focused ion beam (cryo-FIB) can provide a solution to this challenge. We successfully extracted thin specimens from metal-organic framework (MOF) crystals and a hybrid halide perovskite single-crystal film solar cell using cryo-FIB without damaging the inherent structures. The high quality of the specimens enabled the subsequent (S)TEM and electron diffraction studies to reveal complex unknown local structures at an atomic resolution. The obtained structural information allowed us to resolve planar defects in MOF HKUST-1, three-dimensionally reconstruct a concomitant phase in MOF UiO-66, and discover a new CH3NH3PbI3 structure and locate its distribution in a single-crystal film perovskite solar cell. This proof-of-concept study demonstrates that cryo-FIB has a unique ability to handle highly sensitive materials, which can substantially expand the range of applications for electron microscopy.	0
Title: Structural basis for high-affinity peptide inhibition of human Pin1 Abstract: Human Pin1 is a key regulator of cell-cycle progression and plays growth-promoting roles in human cancers. High-affinity inhibitors of Pin1 may provide a unique opportunity for disrupting oncogenic pathways. Here we report two high-resolution X-ray crystal structures of human Pin1 bound to non-natural peptide inhibitors. The structures of the bound high-affinity peptides identify a type-I beta-turn conformation for Pin1 prolyl peptide isomerase domain-peptide binding and an extensive molecular interface for high-affinity recognition. Moreover, these structures suggest chemical elements that may further improve the affinity and pharmacological properties of future peptide-based Pin inhibitors. Finally, an intramolecular hydrogen bond observed in both peptide complexes mimics the cyclic conformation of FK506 and rapamycin. Both FK506 and rapamycin are clinically important inhibitors of other peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerases. This comparative discovery suggests that a cyclic peptide polyketide bridge, like that found in FK506 and rapamycin or a similar linkage, may significantly improve the binding affinity of structure-based Pin1 inhibitors.	0
Title: Genome of Labrenzia sp. PHM005 Reveals a Complete and Active Trans-AT PKS Gene Cluster for the Biosynthesis of Labrenzin Abstract: The complete genome of the strain Labrenzia sp. PHM005, a free-living producer of a pederin analog 18-O-demethyl pederin, hereinafter labrenzin, has been sequenced. This strain contains two replicons comprising a circular chromosome of 6,167,349 bp and a circular plasmid (named p1BIR) of 19,450 bp. A putative gene cluster responsible for the synthesis of labrenzin (lab cluster) has been identified showing that it encodes a trans-AT mixed type PKS/NRPS biosynthetic pathway that is responsible for the synthesis of pederin and possibly an onnamide analog. The putative boundaries of the lab gene cluster were determined by genetic comparisons with other related strains, suggesting that the cluster consists of a 79-kb region comprising 3 genes encoding multidomain hybrid polyketide synthase/non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (PKS/NRPS) proteins (PKS4, PKS/NRPS13, and PKS/NRPS15), and 16 auxiliary enzymes. Transcriptomic analyses suggest that all the genes of the cluster are expressed in our culture conditions (i.e., in minimal medium in the absence of any specific inducer) at detectable levels. We have developed genetic tools to facilitate the manipulation of this strain and the functional characterization of the cluster genes. We have created a site-directed mutant unable to produce pederin, demonstrating experimentally for the first time the role of the cluster in the synthesis of pederin. This work paves the way to unravel the clues of the biosynthesis of pederin family compounds and opens the door to modify and overproduce these anticancer drugs for industrial and pharmaceutical purposes.	1
Title: The complete biosynthetic gene cluster of the 28-membered polyketide macrolactones, halstoctacosanolides, from Streptomyces halstedii HC34 Abstract: Halstoctacoanolides A and B are 28-membered polyketide macrolactones and were isolated from Streptomyces halstedii HC34. The biosynthetic gene cluster (hls cluster) of halstoctacosanolides was completely identified from the genome library of Streptomyces halstedii HC34. DNA sequence analysis of ca. 100 kb region revealed that there were seven type I polyketide synthases (PKSs) and two cytochrome P450 monooxygenases in this cluster. Involvement of the gene cluster in the halstoctacosanolide biosynthesis was demonstrated by the gene disruption of P450 monooxygenase genes. The mutants produced a new deoxygenated halstoctacosanolide derivative, halstoctacosanolide C, which confirmed that the hls gene cluster was essential for the biosynthesis of halstoctacosanolides.	1
Title: Cloning and sequence analysis of genes involved in erythromycin biosynthesis in Saccharopolyspora erythraea: sequence similarities between EryG and a family of S-adenosylmethionine-dependent methyltransferases Abstract: The gene cluster (ery) responsible for production of the macrolide antibiotic erythromycin by Saccharopolyspora erythraea is also known to contain ermE, the gene conferring resistance to the antibiotic. The nucleotide sequence has been determined of a 4.5 kb portion of the biosynthetic gene cluster, from a region lying between 3.7 kb and 8.2 kb 3' of ermE. This has revealed the presence of four complete open reading frames, including the previously known ery gene eryG, which catalyses the last step in the biosynthetic pathway. Comparison of the amino acid sequence of EryG with the sequence of other S-adenosylmethionine (SAM)-dependent methyltransferases has revealed that one of the sequence motifs previously suggested to be part of the SAM-binding site is present not only in EryG but also in many other recently sequenced SAM-dependent methyltransferases. Previous genetic studies have shown that this region also contains gene(s) involved in hydroxylation of the intermediate 6-deoxyerythronolide B. One of the three other open reading frames (eryF) in fact shows very high sequence similarity to known cytochrome P450 hydroxylases. An adjacent gene (ORF5) shows a strikingly high degree of similarity to prokaryotic and eukaryotic acyltransferases and thioesterases.	1
Title: Preferential selection of deletion mutations of the outer membrane lipoprotein gene of Escherichia coli by globomycin Abstract: Globomycin is an antibiotic which inhibits the processing of the prolipoprotein. Eighty globomycin-resistant mutants were independently isolated from Escherichia coli K-12 which had a deletion mutation in chromosomal lipoprotein gene (lpp), but contained a plasmid carrying the wild-type lpp gene. Twenty-six of the mutants did not have the lipoprotein in the membrane fractions. From the analysis of the plasmids of these mutants, all of the lipoprotein-deficient mutations were found to be due to deletion mutations around the lpp gene.	0
Title: Pattern of tamoxifen-induced Tie2 deletion in endothelial cells in mature blood vessels using endo SCL-Cre-ERT transgenic mice Abstract: Tyrosine-protein kinase receptor Tie2, also known as Tunica interna Endothelial cell Kinase or TEK plays a prominent role in endothelial responses to angiogenic and inflammatory stimuli. Here we generated a novel inducible Tie2 knockout mouse model, which targets mature (micro)vascular endothelium, enabling the study of the organ-specific contribution of Tie2 to these responses. Mice with floxed Tie2 exon 9 alleles (Tie2floxed/floxed) were crossed with end-SCL-Cre-ERT transgenic mice, generating offspring in which Tie2 exon 9 is deleted in the endothelial compartment upon tamoxifen-induced activation of Cre-recombinase (Tie2ΔE9). Successful deletion of Tie2 exon 9 in kidney, lung, heart, aorta, and liver, was accompanied by a heterogeneous, organ-dependent reduction in Tie2 mRNA and protein expression. Microvascular compartment-specific reduction in Tie2 mRNA and protein occurred in arterioles of all studied organs, in renal glomeruli, and in lung capillaries. In kidney, lung, and heart, reduced Tie2 expression was accompanied by a reduction in Tie1 mRNA expression. The heterogeneous, organ- and microvascular compartment-dependent knockout pattern of Tie2 in the Tie2floxed/floxed;end-SCL-Cre-ERT mouse model suggests that future studies using similar knockout strategies should include a meticulous analysis of the knockout extent of the gene of interest, prior to studying its role in pathological conditions, so that proper conclusions can be drawn.	0
Title: Dose-dependent effects of Lactobacillus rhamnosus on serum interleukin-17 production and intestinal T-cell responses in pigs challenged with Escherichia coli Abstract: The mechanism underlying the dose effect of probiotics on ameliorating diarrhea has not been fully elucidated. Here, low (1 × 10(9) CFU/ml) or high (1 × 10(11) CFU/ml) doses of Lactobacillus rhamnosus ATCC 7469 were administered orally to piglets for 1 week before F4 (K88)-positive enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (F4(+) ETEC) challenge. Administration of a low, but not a high, dose of L. rhamnosus decreased the percentage of CD3(+) CD4(+) CD8(-) T cells in the peripheral blood. Notably, transiently increased serum concentrations of interleukin-17A (IL-17A) were observed after F4(+) ETEC challenge in pigs pretreated with a high dose of L. rhamnosus. Administration of L. rhamnosus increased the percentage of the small intestinal lamina propria CD3(+) CD4(+) CD8(-) cells and Peyer's patch CD3(+) CD4(-) CD8(-) and CD3(-) CD4(-) CD8(+) cells. The percentage of ileal intraepithelial CD3(+) CD4(-) CD8(+) cells increased only in the high-dose piglets. Administration of L. rhamnosus downregulated expression of ileal IL-17A after F4(+) ETEC challenge but had no effect on expression of gamma interferon (IFN-γ), IL-12, IL-4, and FOXP3 mRNA in the small intestine. Expression of jejunal IL-2, ileal transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1), and ileal IL-10 was upregulated in the low-dose piglets after F4(+) ETEC challenge. Our findings suggest that amelioration of infectious diarrhea in piglets by L. rhamnosus is associated with the generation of lamina propria CD3(+) CD4(+) CD8(-) T cells, the expansion of Peyer's patch CD3(+) CD4(-) CD8(-) and CD3(-) CD4(-) CD8(+) cells, and the attenuation of F4(+) ETEC-induced increase in CD3(+) CD4(+) CD8(+) T cells in the small intestine. However, consumption of high doses of L. rhamnosus may increase levels of serum IL-17A after F4(+) ETEC challenge, thus eliciting a strong proinflammatory response.	0
Title: Pseurotin A and its analogues as inhibitors of immunoglobulin E [correction of immunoglobuline E] production Abstract: A natural product, pseurotin A inhibits IgE production in vitro. Wide variety of chemical modification of pseurotin A was performed. Structure-activity relationship studies of pseurotin analogues elucidated that 10-deoxypseurotin A strongly inhibits IgE production with IC(50) of 0.066 microM. An immunosuppressive activity of another natural product, synerazol was also found.	1
Title: Quantitation of Guggenheimella bovis and treponemes in bovine tissues related to digital dermatitis Abstract: Digital dermatitis is an inflammation of uncertain aetiology in the skin of the foot of cattle. In 2005, a novel microorganism, Guggenheimella bovis, was isolated from the advancing front of digital dermatitis lesions, suggesting a possible role in pathogenesis. In the present study, tissue samples of 20 affected cows were examined by quantitative PCR for G. bovis, treponemes and the total eubacterial load. High numbers of eubacteria and treponemes were found in most lesions, whereas only a few lesions contained Guggenheimella, and only at low concentrations. The results argue against the relevance of G. bovis in the aetiology of digital dermatitis in cattle, but are consistent with a role for treponemes.	0
Title: Genetic manipulation of the Fusarium fujikuroi fusarin gene cluster yields insight into the complex regulation and fusarin biosynthetic pathway Abstract: In this work, the biosynthesis and regulation of the polyketide synthase/nonribosomal peptide synthetase (PKS/NRPS)-derived mutagenic mycotoxin fusarin C was studied in the fungus Fusarium fujikuroi. The fusarin gene cluster consists of nine genes (fus1-fus9) that are coexpressed under high-nitrogen and acidic pH conditions. Chromatin immunoprecipitation revealed a correlation between high expression and enrichment of activating H3K9-acetylation marks under inducing conditions. We provide evidence that only four genes are sufficient for the biosynthesis. The combination of genetic engineering with nuclear magnetic resonance and mass-spectrometry-based structure elucidation allowed the discovery of the putative fusarin biosynthetic pathway. Surprisingly, we indicate that PKS/NRPS releases its product with an open ring structure, probably as an alcohol. Our data indicate that 2-pyrrolidone ring closure, oxidation at C-20, and, finally, methylation at C-20 are catalyzed by Fus2, Fus8, and Fus9, respectively.	1
Title: Uncovering the formation and selection of benzylmalonyl-CoA from the biosynthesis of splenocin and enterocin reveals a versatile way to introduce amino acids into polyketide carbon scaffolds Abstract: Selective modification of carbon scaffolds via biosynthetic engineering is important for polyketide structural diversification. Yet, this scope is currently restricted to simple aliphatic groups due to (1) limited variety of CoA-linked extender units, which lack aromatic structures and chemical reactivity, and (2) narrow acyltransferase (AT) specificity, which is limited to aliphatic CoA-linked extender units. In this report, we uncovered and characterized the first aromatic CoA-linked extender unit benzylmalonyl-CoA from the biosynthetic pathways of splenocin and enterocin in Streptomyces sp. CNQ431. Its synthesis employs a deamination/reductive carboxylation strategy to convert phenylalanine into benzylmalonyl-CoA, providing a link between amino acid and CoA-linked extender unit synthesis. By characterization of its selection, we further validated that AT domains of splenocin, and antimycin polyketide synthases are able to select this extender unit to introduce the phenyl group into their dilactone scaffolds. The biosynthetic machinery involved in the formation of this extender unit is highly versatile and can be potentially tailored for tyrosine, histidine and aspartic acid. The disclosed aromatic extender unit, amino acid-oriented synthetic pathway, and aromatic-selective AT domains provides a systematic breakthrough toward current knowledge of polyketide extender unit formation and selection, and also opens a route for further engineering of polyketide carbon scaffolds using amino acids.	1
Title: Biosynthesis and Antimicrobial Activity of Pseudodesmin and Viscosinamide Cyclic Lipopeptides Produced by Pseudomonads Associated with the Cocoyam Rhizosphere Abstract: Pseudomonas cyclic lipopeptides (CLPs) are encoded non-ribosomally by biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) and possess diverse biological activities. In this study, we conducted chemical structure and BGC analyses with antimicrobial activity assays for two CLPs produced by Pseudomonas strains isolated from the cocoyam rhizosphere in Cameroon and Nigeria. LC-MS and NMR analyses showed that the Pseudomonas sp. COR52 and A2W4.9 produce pseudodesmin and viscosinamide, respectively. These CLPs belong to the Viscosin group characterized by a nonapeptidic moiety with a 7-membered macrocycle. Similar to other Viscosin-group CLPs, the initiatory non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) gene of the viscosinamide BGC is situated remotely from the other two NRPS genes. In contrast, the pseudodesmin genes are all clustered in a single genomic locus. Nano- to micromolar levels of pseudodesmin and viscosinamide led to the hyphal distortion and/or disintegration of Rhizoctonia solani AG2-2 and Pythium myriotylum CMR1, whereas similar levels of White Line-Inducing Principle (WLIP), another member of the Viscosin group, resulted in complete lysis of both soil-borne phytopathogens. In addition to the identification of the biosynthetic genes of these two CLPs and the demonstration of their interaction with soil-borne pathogens, this study provides further insights regarding evolutionary divergence within the Viscosin group.	1
Title: Non-ATG-initiated translation directed by microsatellite expansions Abstract: Trinucleotide expansions cause disease by both protein- and RNA-mediated mechanisms. Unexpectedly, we discovered that CAG expansion constructs express homopolymeric polyglutamine, polyalanine, and polyserine proteins in the absence of an ATG start codon. This repeat-associated non-ATG translation (RAN translation) occurs across long, hairpin-forming repeats in transfected cells or when expansion constructs are integrated into the genome in lentiviral-transduced cells and brains. Additionally, we show that RAN translation across human spinocerebellar ataxia type 8 (SCA8) and myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) CAG expansion transcripts results in the accumulation of SCA8 polyalanine and DM1 polyglutamine expansion proteins in previously established SCA8 and DM1 mouse models and human tissue. These results have implications for understanding fundamental mechanisms of gene expression. Moreover, these toxic, unexpected, homopolymeric proteins now should be considered in pathogenic models of microsatellite disorders.	0
Title: Studies toward the unique pederin family member psymberin: structure-activity relationships, biochemical studies, and genetics identify the mode-of-action of psymberin Abstract: Psymberin is the only member of the pederin natural product family that contains a dihydroisocoumarin side chain. Structural modifications of psymberin uncoupled inhibition of protein translation from cytotoxicity, suggesting that psymberin has more than one bioactivity. A forward genetic screen in Caenorhabditis elegans was conducted to identify the molecular target(s) of psymberin. Multiple independent psymberin-resistant mutants were isolated, each containing the same point mutation in a gene encoding a ribosomal protein. However, a psymberin-resistant mutant strain bearing this mutation was not cross-resistant to the pederin family member mycalamide A, which binds to the archaeal form of the same protein. Thus, two pederin family members likely differ in how they bind the same molecular target. The accumulation of psymberin in cells was sensitive to the stereochemistry of the amide side chain at C4 or C8 and the presence of the dihydroisocoumarin side chain. The observation that psymberin diastereomers or dihydroisocoumarin-truncated analogs lose all cytotoxic activity while retaining the ability to inhibit protein translation in a cell-free in vitro assay can be explained in the context of these differential cell uptake issues. Finally, we also demonstrate that the blistering activity associated with pederin and other members of the family is not due to their protein synthesis inhibiting activity. Unlike pederin and mycalamide, psymberin does not display irritant or blistering activity.	1
Title: Full-length RecE enhances linear-linear homologous recombination and facilitates direct cloning for bioprospecting Abstract: Functional analysis of genome sequences requires methods for cloning DNA of interest. However, existing methods, such as library cloning and screening, are too demanding or inefficient for high-throughput application to the wealth of genomic data being delivered by massively parallel sequencing. Here we describe direct DNA cloning based on the discovery that the full-length Rac prophage protein RecE and its partner RecT mediate highly efficient linear-linear homologous recombination mechanistically distinct from conventional recombineering mediated by Redαβ from lambda phage or truncated versions of RecET. We directly cloned all ten megasynthetase gene clusters (each 10–52 kb in length) from Photorhabdus luminescens into expression vectors and expressed two of them in a heterologous host to identify the metabolites luminmycin A and luminmide A/B. We also directly cloned cDNAs and exactly defined segments from bacterial artificial chromosomes. Direct cloning with full-length RecE expands the DNA engineering toolbox and will facilitate bioprospecting for natural products.	1
Title: Identification and functional analysis of brassicicene C biosynthetic gene cluster in Alternaria brassicicola Abstract: The biosynthetic gene cluster of brassicicene C was identified in Alternaria brassicicola strain ATCC 96836 from genome database search. In vivo and in vitro study clearly revealed the function of Orf8 and Orf6 as a fusicoccadiene synthase and methyltransferase, respectively. The understanding toward the biosynthetic pathway promises construction of this type of diterpene compounds with genetic engineering.	1
Title: Isolation and characterization of enterocin W, a novel two-peptide lantibiotic produced by Enterococcus faecalis NKR-4-1 Abstract: Enterococcus faecalis NKR-4-1 isolated from pla-ra produces a novel two-peptide lantibiotic, termed enterocin W, comprising Wα and Wβ. The structure of enterocin W exhibited similarity with that of plantaricin W. The two peptides acted synergistically, and their order of binding to the cell membrane was important for their inhibitory activity.	1
Title: Reductive ligation mediated one-step disulfide formation of S-nitrosothiols Abstract: A one-step reductive ligation mediated disulfide formation of S-nitrosothiols was developed. This reaction involves the reaction of the S-nitroso group with phosphine-thioesters to form sulfenamide and thiolate intermediates, which then undergo a fast intermolecular disulfide formation to form stable conjugates. This reaction can be used to design new biosensors of S-nitrosated proteins.	0
Title: A Flavin-Dependent Decarboxylase-Dehydrogenase-Monooxygenase Assembles the Warhead of α,β-Epoxyketone Proteasome Inhibitors Abstract: The α,β-epoxyketone proteasome inhibitor TMC-86A was discovered as a previously unreported metabolite of Streptomyces chromofuscus ATCC49982, and the gene cluster responsible for its biosynthesis was identified via genome sequencing. Incorporation experiments with [(13)C-methyl]l-methionine implicated an α-dimethyl-β-keto acid intermediate in the biosynthesis of TMC-86A. Incubation of the chemically synthesized α-dimethyl-β-keto acid with a purified recombinant flavin-dependent enzyme that is conserved in all known pathways for epoxyketone biosynthesis resulted in formation of the corresponding α-methyl-α,β-epoxyketone. This transformation appears to proceed via an unprecedented decarboxylation-dehydrogenation-monooxygenation cascade. The biosynthesis of the TMC-86A warhead is completed by cytochrome P450-mediated hydroxylation of the α-methyl-α,β-epoxyketone.	1
Title: Loop-mediated isothermal amplification method for rapid detection of the toxic dinoflagellate Alexandrium, which causes algal blooms and poisoning of shellfish Abstract: The marine dinoflagellate genus Alexandrium includes a number of species that produce potent neurotoxins responsible for paralytic shellfish poisoning, which in humans may cause muscular paralysis, neurological symptoms and, in extreme cases, death. Because of the genetic diversity of different genera and species, molecular tools may help to detect the presence of target microorganisms in marine field samples. Here we employed a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) method for the rapid and simple detection of toxic Alexandrium species. A set of four primers were designed based upon the conserved region of the 5.8S rRNA gene of members of the genus Alexandrium. Using this detection system, toxic Alexandrium genes were amplified and visualized as a ladder-like pattern of bands on agarose gels under isothermal condition within 60 min. The LAMP amplicons were also directly visualized by eye in the reaction tube by the addition of SYBR Green I. This LAMP assay was 10-fold more sensitive than a conventional PCR method with a detection limit of 5 cells per tube when targeting DNA from Alexandrium minutum. The LAMP assay reported here indicates the potential usefulness of the technique as a valuable simple, rapid alternative procedure for the detection of target toxic Alexandrium species during coastal water monitoring.	0
Title: Synthesis of phantasmidine Abstract: Reaction of 6-chloro-2-fluoro-3-pyridineacetamide with 1,2-bis(trimethylsilyloxy)cyclobutene in ether saturated with hydrogen chloride afforded the keto amide in 85% yield. In the key step, treatment of the keto amide with aqueous KOH in t-BuOH resulted in a tandem intramolecular aldol reaction-intramolecular nucleophilic aromatic substitution sequence to give the tetracylic lactam in 46% yield. Reduction of the lactam with BH(3) in THF gave phantasmidine in 67% yield.	0
Title: The biosynthetic pathway to ossamycin, a macrocyclic polyketide bearing a spiroacetal moiety Abstract: Ossamycin from Streptomyces hygroscopicus var. ossamyceticus is an antifungal and cytotoxic polyketide and a potent inhibitor of the mitochondrial ATPase. Analysis of a near-complete genome sequence of the ossamycin producer has allowed the identification of the 127-kbp ossamycin biosynthetic gene cluster. The presence in the cluster of a specific crotonyl-CoA carboxylase/reductase homologue suggests that the 5-methylhexanoate extension unit used in construction of the macrocyclic core is incorporated intact from the unusual precursor isobutyrylmalonyl-CoA. Surprisingly, the modular polyketide synthase uses only 14 extension modules to accomplish 15 cycles of polyketide chain extension, a rare example of programmed iteration on a modular polyketide synthase. Specific deletion of genes encoding cytochrome P450 enzymes has given insight into the late-stage tailoring of the ossamycin macrocycle required for the attachment of the unusual 2,3,4,6-deoxyaminohexose sugar l-ossamine to C-8 of the ossamycin macrocycle. The ossamycin cluster also encodes a putative spirocyclase enzyme, OssO, which may play a role in establishing the characteristic spiroketal moiety of the natural product.	1
Title: The Self-Assembly of a Cyclometalated Palladium Photosensitizer into Protein-Stabilized Nanorods Triggers Drug Uptake In Vitro and In Vivo Abstract: Enhanced passive diffusion is usually considered to be the primary cause of the enhanced cellular uptake of cyclometalated drugs because cyclometalation lowers the charge of a metal complex and increases its lipophilicity. However, in this work, monocationic cyclometalated palladium complexes [1]OAc (N^N^C^N) and [2]OAc (N^N^N^C) were found to self-assemble, in aqueous solutions, into soluble supramolecular nanorods, while their tetrapyridyl bicationic analogue [3](OAc)2 (N^N^N^N) dissolved as isolated molecules. These nanorods formed via metallophilic Pd···Pd interaction and π-π stacking and were stabilized in the cell medium by serum proteins, in the absence of which the nanorods precipitated. In cell cultures, these protein-stabilized self-assembled nanorods were responsible for the improved cellular uptake of the cyclometalated compounds, which took place via endocytosis (i.e., an active uptake pathway). In addition to triggering self-assembly, cyclometalation in [1]OAc also led to dramatically enhanced photodynamic properties under blue light irradiation. These combined penetration and photodynamic properties were observed in multicellular tumor spheroids and in a mice tumor xenograft, demonstrating that protein-stabilized nanoaggregation of cyclometalated drugs such as [1]OAc also allows efficient cellular uptake in 3D tumor models. Overall, serum proteins appear to be a major element in drug design because they strongly influence the size and bioavailability of supramolecular drug aggregates and hence their efficacy in vitro and in vivo.	0
Title: Structural studies of an A2-type modular polyketide synthase ketoreductase reveal features controlling α-substituent stereochemistry Abstract: Modular polyketide synthase ketoreductases often set two stereocenters when reducing intermediates in the biosynthesis of a complex polyketide. Here we report the 2.55-Å resolution structure of an A2-type ketoreductase from the 11th module of the amphotericin polyketide synthase that sets a combination of l-α-methyl and l-β-hydroxyl stereochemistries and represents the final catalytically competent ketoreductase type to be structurally elucidated. Through structure-guided mutagenesis a double mutant of an A1-type ketoreductase was generated that functions as an A2-type ketoreductase on a diketide substrate analogue, setting an α-alkyl substituent in an l-orientation rather than in the d-orientation set by the unmutated ketoreductase. When the activity of the double mutant was examined in the context of an engineered triketide lactone synthase, the anticipated triketide lactone was not produced even though the ketoreductase-containing module still reduced the diketide substrate analogue as expected. These findings suggest that re-engineered ketoreductases may be catalytically outcompeted within engineered polyketide synthase assembly lines.	0
Title: Visual space is compressed in prefrontal cortex before eye movements Abstract: We experience the visual world through a series of saccadic eye movements, each one shifting our gaze to bring objects of interest to the fovea for further processing. Although such movements lead to frequent and substantial displacements of the retinal image, these displacements go unnoticed. It is widely assumed that a primary mechanism underlying this apparent stability is an anticipatory shifting of visual receptive fields (RFs) from their presaccadic to their postsaccadic locations before movement onset. Evidence of this predictive 'remapping' of RFs has been particularly apparent within brain structures involved in gaze control. However, critically absent among that evidence are detailed measurements of visual RFs before movement onset. Here we show that during saccade preparation, rather than remap, RFs of neurons in a prefrontal gaze control area massively converge towards the saccadic target. We mapped the visual RFs of prefrontal neurons during stable fixation and immediately before the onset of eye movements, using multi-electrode recordings in monkeys. Following movements from an initial fixation point to a target, RFs remained stationary in retinocentric space. However, in the period immediately before movement onset, RFs shifted by as much as 18 degrees of visual angle, and converged towards the target location. This convergence resulted in a threefold increase in the proportion of RFs responding to stimuli near the target region. In addition, like in human observers, the population of prefrontal neurons grossly mislocalized presaccadic stimuli as being closer to the target. Our results show that RF shifts do not predict the retinal displacements due to saccades, but instead reflect the overriding perception of target space during eye movements.	0
Title: The fumagillin biosynthetic gene cluster in Aspergillus fumigatus encodes a cryptic terpene cyclase involved in the formation of β-trans-bergamotene Abstract: Fumagillin 1 is a meroterpenoid from Aspergillus fumigatus that is known for its anti-angiogenic activity by binding to human methionine aminopeptidase 2. The genetic and molecular basis for biosynthesis of 1 had been an enigma despite the availability of the A. fumigatus genome sequence. Here, we report the identification and verification of the fma gene cluster, followed by characterization of the polyketide synthase and acyltransferase involved in biosynthesis of the dioic acid portion of 1. More significantly, we uncovered the elusive β-trans-bergamotene synthase in A. fumigatus as a membrane-bound terpene cyclase.	1
Title: Elucidation of Piericidin A1 biosynthetic locus revealed a thioesterase-dependent mechanism of α-pyridone ring formation Abstract: Piericidins are a class of α-pyridone antibiotics that inhibit mitochondrial respiratory chain and exhibit antimicrobial, antifungal, and antitumor activities. Sequential analysis of Streptomyces piomogeues var. Hangzhouwanensis genome revealed six modular polyketide synthases, an amidotransferase, two methyltransferases, and a monooxygenase for piericidin A1 production. Gene functional analysis and deletion results provide overview of the biosynthesis pathway. Furthermore, in vitro characterization of the terminal polyketide synthase module with the thioesterase domain using β-ketoacyl substrates was performed. That revealed a pathway where the α-pyridone ring formation is dependent on hydrolysis of the product β, δ-diketo carboxylic acid by the C-terminal thioesterase followed by amidation and cyclization. These findings set the stage to investigate unusual enzymatic mechanisms in α-pyridone antibiotics biosynthesis, provide a foundation for genome mining of α-pyridone antibiotics, and produce analogs by molecular engineering.	1
Title: Genetic safeguard against mycotoxin cyclopiazonic acid production in Aspergillus oryzae Abstract: Aspergillus oryzae is a fungus widely used in traditional Japanese fermentation industries. Its inability to produce mycotoxins, due to mutation or transcriptional repression of the genes responsible for their biosynthesis, is consistent with the hypothesis that A. oryzae is a domesticated species derived from A. flavus, a wild species that is a well-known producer of aflatoxin. In contrast, the cyclopiazonic acid (CPA) biosynthetic gene (cpa) cluster in A. oryzae contains genes that have been lost in A. flavus. Through targeted gene inactivation, isolation of the corresponding metabolite, and evaluation of biological activity of the metabolite, we demonstrated that an A. oryzae-specific gene-cpaH-mediates the conversion of CPA into the less toxic 2-oxocyclopiazonic acid, a new analogue of CPA. The detoxifying properties of cpaH, which have been lost in the A. flavus pathway, reflect the relationship of the two species.	1
Title: Elucidation of the biosynthesis of the methane catalyst coenzyme F430 Abstract: Methane biogenesis in methanogens is mediated by methyl-coenzyme M reductase, an enzyme that is also responsible for the utilization of methane through anaerobic methane oxidation. The enzyme uses an ancillary factor called coenzyme F430, a nickel-containing modified tetrapyrrole that promotes catalysis through a methyl radical/Ni(ii)-thiolate intermediate. However, it is unclear how coenzyme F430 is synthesized from the common primogenitor uroporphyrinogen iii, incorporating 11 steric centres into the macrocycle, although the pathway must involve chelation, amidation, macrocyclic ring reduction, lactamization and carbocyclic ring formation. Here we identify the proteins that catalyse the biosynthesis of coenzyme F430 from sirohydrochlorin, termed CfbA-CfbE, and demonstrate their activity. The research completes our understanding of how the repertoire of tetrapyrrole-based pigments are constructed, permitting the development of recombinant systems to use these metalloprosthetic groups more widely.	1
Title: Heterologous expression and genetic engineering of the tubulysin biosynthetic gene cluster using Red/ET recombineering and inactivation mutagenesis Abstract: Although the tubulysin (tub) biosynthetic gene cluster has been located in two myxobacterial strains, it appears in both cases to be incomplete as obvious candidates for acyl transfer and oxidation functions are lacking. Here, we report the engineering of a heterologous expression system for the tub biosynthetic pathway from strain Cystobacter sp. SBCb004. The entire tub core cluster was reconstituted from two cosmids using Red/ET recombineering and heterologous expression achieved in strains Pseudomonas putida and Myxococcus xanthus. Availability of the heterologous expression system and the natural producer strain SBCb004 provided a platform for the functional investigation of various biosynthetic genes by targeted inactivation. In addition, BLAST analysis of SBCb004 genome data was used to identify multiple candidate monooxygenases, whose involvement in tubulysin assembly was evaluated using a combination of knockout mutagenesis and heterologous expression.	1
Title: Common biosynthetic origins for polycyclic tetramate macrolactams from phylogenetically diverse bacteria Abstract: A combination of small molecule chemistry, biosynthetic analysis, and genome mining has revealed the unexpected conservation of polycyclic tetramate macrolactam biosynthetic loci in diverse bacteria. Initially our chemical analysis of a Streptomyces strain associated with the southern pine beetle led to the discovery of frontalamides A and B, two previously undescribed members of this antibiotic family. Genome analyses and genetic manipulation of the producing organism led to the identification of the frontalamide biosynthetic gene cluster and several biosynthetic intermediates. The biosynthetic locus for the frontalamides' mixed polyketide/amino acid structure encodes a hybrid polyketide synthase nonribosomal peptide synthetase (PKS-NRPS), which resembles iterative enzymes known in fungi. No such mixed iterative PKS-NRPS enzymes have been characterized in bacteria. Genome-mining efforts revealed strikingly conserved frontalamide-like biosynthetic clusters in the genomes of phylogenetically diverse bacteria ranging from proteobacteria to actinomycetes. Screens for environmental actinomycete isolates carrying frontalamide-like biosynthetic loci led to the isolation of a number of positive strains, the majority of which produced candidate frontalamide-like compounds under suitable growth conditions. These results establish the prevalence of frontalamide-like gene clusters in diverse bacterial types, with medicinally important Streptomyces species being particularly enriched.	1
Title: Biosynthesis of aromatic polyketides in bacteria Abstract: Natural products, produced chiefly by microorganisms and plants, can be large and structurally complex molecules. These molecules are manufactured by cellular assembly lines, in which enzymes construct the molecules in a stepwise fashion. The means by which enzymes interact and work together in a modular fashion to create diverse structural features has been an active area of research; the work has provided insight into the fine details of biosynthesis. A number of polycyclic aromatic natural products--including several noteworthy anticancer, antibacterial, antifungal, antiviral, antiparasitic, and other medicinally significant substances--are synthesized by polyketide synthases (PKSs) in soil-borne bacteria called actinomycetes. Concerted biosynthetic, enzymological, and structural biological investigations into these modular enzyme systems have yielded interesting mechanistic insights. A core module called the minimal PKS is responsible for synthesizing a highly reactive, protein-bound poly-beta-ketothioester chain. In the absence of other enzymes, the minimal PKS also catalyzes chain initiation and release, yielding an assortment of polycyclic aromatic compounds. In the presence of an initiation PKS module, polyketide backbones bearing additional alkyl, alkenyl, or aryl primer units are synthesized, whereas a range of auxiliary PKS enzymes and tailoring enzymes convert the product of the minimal PKS into the final natural product. In this Account, we summarize the knowledge that has been gained regarding this family of PKSs through recent investigations into the biosynthetic pathways of two natural products, actinorhodin and R1128 (A-D). We also discuss the practical relevance of these fundamental insights for the engineered biosynthesis of new polycyclic aromatic compounds. With a deeper understanding of the biosynthetic process in hand, we can assert control at various stages of molecular construction and thus introduce unnatural functional groups in the process. The metabolic engineer affords a number of new avenues for creating novel molecular structures that will likely have properties akin to their fully natural cousins.	1
Title: Depletion of T cell epitopes in lysostaphin mitigates anti-drug antibody response and enhances antibacterial efficacy in vivo Abstract: The enzyme lysostaphin possesses potent anti-staphylococcal activity and represents a promising antibacterial drug candidate; however, its immunogenicity poses a barrier to clinical translation. Here, structure-based biomolecular design enabled widespread depletion of lysostaphin DRB1(∗)0401 restricted T cell epitopes, and resulting deimmunized variants exhibited striking reductions in anti-drug antibody responses upon administration to humanized HLA-transgenic mice. This reduced immunogenicity translated into improved efficacy in the form of protection against repeated challenges with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). In contrast, while wild-type lysostaphin was efficacious against the initial MRSA infection, it failed to clear subsequent bacterial challenges that were coincident with escalating anti-drug antibody titers. These results extend the existing deimmunization literature, in which reduced immunogenicity and retained efficacy are assessed independently of each other. By correlating in vivo efficacy with longitudinal measures of anti-drug antibody development, we provide the first direct evidence that T cell epitope depletion manifests enhanced biotherapeutic efficacy.	0
Title: Transcriptional organization and regulation of an antibiotic export complex in the producing Streptomyces culture Abstract: Three open reading frames (ORFs) in the actII region of the actinorhodin biosynthetic gene cluster of Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2), which are involved in the export of the antibiotic are carried on two divergent transcripts. A monocistronic transcript carries actII-ORF1, encoding a putative repressor protein, and a bicistronic transcript codes for actII-ORF2 and -ORF3, whose products have been postulated to form an antibiotic export complex. The actII-ORF1 and actII-ORF2/3 transcripts each have a single promoter and the promoters for the two transcripts overlap. Both promoters are most active in cultures that have developed to the stage of actinorhodin production. The promoters resemble consensus promoters of the vegetative class in Escherichia coli and Streptomyces. We also demonstrate that these promoters are expressed in E. coli and use this finding to reveal a regulatory role for the repressor, using the xylE reporter gene on promoter-probe shuttle vectors and regulated expression of the actII-ORF1 gene under control of Plac. The actII-ORF2/3 promoter is strongly repressed by the ORF1 product and the ORF1 product also represses its own promoter. The finding that the operator/promoter arrangement, and regulatory interconnection, of an antibiotic export/repressor gene pair in Streptomyces strikingly resemble those for tetracycline resistance in bacteria of clinical importance supports the hypothesis of an evolutionary origin of such genes in an ancestral actinomycete.	1
Title: Identification of a gene cluster for antibacterial polyketide-derived antibiotic biosynthesis in the nystatin producer Streptomyces noursei ATCC 11455 Abstract: Streptomyces noursei ATCC 11455 produces the antifungal polyene antibiotic nystatin containing the deoxysugar moiety mycosamine. Part of the deoxythymidyl diphosphate (TDP)-glucose dehydratase gene (gdhA) known to be involved in deoxysugar biosynthesis was amplified by PCR from genomic DNA of S. noursei ATCC 11455. A gene library for S. noursei was made and screened with the gdhA probe. Several overlapping phage clones covering about 30 kb of the S. noursei genome were physically mapped. A partial DNA sequencing analysis of this region resulted in the identification of several putative genes typical of macrolide antibiotic biosynthetic gene clusters. A gene-transfer system for 5. noursei has been established, and gene deletion or disruption experiments within the putative biosynthetic gene cluster were performed. All of the knock-out mutants retained the ability to produce nystatin, suggesting that the identified gene cluster is not involved in biosynthesis of this antibiotic. Culture extracts from the wild-type strain and three knock-out mutants were analysed by TLC followed by a bioassay against Micrococcus luteus. Two antibacterial compounds were found to be synthesized by the wild-type strain while only one was produced by the mutants. This provided evidence for the involvement of the identified gene cluster in the biosynthesis of a presumably novel antibacterial macrolide antibiotic in S. noursei.	0
Title: The Stereocontrolled Biosynthesis of Mirror-Symmetric 2,4-Diaminobutyric Acid Homopolymers Is Critically Governed by Adenylation Activations Abstract: Among the four bioactive cationic homo-poly(amino acids) discovered in nature, two are mirror-image isomers of poly(2,4-diaminobutyric acid) (poly-Dab) whose biosynthesis has long been unexplained. Their structural analogy plausibly suggested that they could share a common biosynthetic pathway utilizing ε-poly(l-lysine) synthetase-like enzymology but with an unprecedented process for enantiomeric inversion of polymer building blocks. To investigate this possibility, we comparatively explored the biosynthesis of poly-l-Dab and its mirror-image isomer poly-d-Dab in Streptomyces celluloflavus USE31 and Streptoalloteichus hindustanus NBRC15115, respectively, through genome mining, genetic inactivation, and heterologous expression combined with biochemical assays. While they shared the same biosynthetic pathway, the poly-d-Dab biosynthetic gene cluster additionally harbored the racemase gene. The critical finding that poly-d-Dab synthetase, in contrast to the synthetase generating the l-isomer, selectively activated d-Dab through adenylation conclusively demonstrated that free diffusible d-Dab preactivationally generated by the racemase is directly activated to be incorporated into the polymer. Our study thus represents the first demonstration of the stereoselective biosynthesis of a nonribosomal peptide governed by adenylation activity for a d-amino acid other than alanine. In silico sequence comparison between poly-Dab synthetases allowed us to identify amino acid residues potentially responsible for the discrimination of Dab enantiomers. Our results will provide significant insight not only for the future discovery of novel bioactive cationic poly(amino acids) but also for the creation of designer nonribosomal peptides with d-configuration.	1
Title: Transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta 1 internalization: modulation by ligand interaction with TGF-beta receptors types I and II and a mechanism that is distinct from clathrin-mediated endocytosis Abstract: Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) internalization was studied by monitoring the uptake of (125)I-TGF-beta1 in Mv1Lu cells, which endogenously express TGF-beta receptors types I (RI), II (RII), and III (RIII), and 293 cells transfected with RI and RII. At 37 degrees C internalization occurred rapidly, within 10 min of ligand addition. Internalization was optimal in 293 cells expressing both RI and RII. Internalization was prevented by phenylarsine oxide, a nonspecific inhibitor of receptor internalization, but was not affected by reagents that interfere with clathrin-mediated endocytosis such as monodansylcadaverine, K44A dynamin, and inhibitors of endosomal acidification. Electron microscopic examination of Mv1Lu cells treated with (125)I- TGF-beta1 at 37 degrees C indicated that internalization occurred via a noncoated vesicular mechanism. Internalization was prevented by prebinding cells with TGF-beta1 at 4 degrees C for 2 h prior to switching the cells to 37 degrees C. This was attributed to a loss of receptor binding, as indicated by a rapid decrease in the amount of TGF-beta1 bound to the cell surface at 37 degrees C and by a reduction in the labeling intensities of RI and RII in (125)I-TGF-beta1-cross-linking experiments. Mv1Lu or 293 (RI+RII) cells, prebound with TGF-beta1 at 4 degrees C and subsequently stripped of ligand by an acid wash, nevertheless initiated a signaling response upon transfer to 37 degrees C, suggesting that prebinding promotes formation of stable RI.RII complexes that can signal independently of ligand.	0
Title: A FRET-Based Near-Infrared Fluorescent Probe for Ratiometric Detection of Cysteine in Mitochondria Abstract: We report a near-infrared fluorescent probe A for the ratiometric detection of cysteine based on FRET from a coumarin donor to a near-infrared rhodamine acceptor. Upon addition of cysteine, the coumarin fluorescence increased dramatically up to 18-fold and the fluorescence of the rhodamine acceptor decreased moderately by 45 % under excitation of the coumarin unit. Probe A has been used to detect cysteine concentration changes in live cells ratiometrically and to visualize fluctuations in cysteine concentrations induced by oxidation stress through treatment with hydrogen peroxide or lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Finally, probe A was successfully applied for the in vivo imaging of Drosophila melanogaster larvae to measure cysteine concentration changes.	0
Title: Assembly of high-nuclearity Sn26 , Sn34 -oxo clusters: solvent strategies and inorganic Sn incorporation Abstract: A series of unprecedented high-nuclearity tin-oxo nanoclusters (up to Sn34 ) with structural diversity have been obtained. The characteristics of the applied solvents had great influence on the assembly of these Sn-O clusters. Pure alcohol environments only gave rise to small clusters of Sn6 , whilst the introduction of water significantly increased the nuclearity to Sn26 , which greatly exceeds those of the known tin-oxo clusters (≤14); the use of aprotic CH3CN finally produced the largest Sn34 to date. Apart from the nuclearity breakthrough, the obtained tin-oxo clusters also present new structural types that are not found in previous reports, including a layered nanorod-like structure of Sn26 and the cage-dimer structure of Sn34 . The layered Sn26 clusters represent good molecular models for SnO2 materials. Moreover, an electrode derived from TOC-17 with a {Sn26 } core shows better electrocatalytic CO2 reduction activity than that from TOC-18 with Sn34 . This work not only provides an efficient methodology for the rational assembly of high-nuclearity Sn-O clusters, but also extends their potential applications in energy conversion.	0
Title: Transcriptional analysis of the isopenicillin N synthase-encoding gene of Streptomyces clavuligerus Abstract: The gene (pcbC) encoding isopenicillin N synthase of Streptomyces clavuligerus is separated from an upstream open reading frame (ORF) by a 31-bp intergenic region. Inspection of the sequence of this intergenic region did not identify a promoter sequence. The promoter probe plasmid, pIJ4083, which contains the promoter-less catechol-2,3-dioxygenase (C23O)-encoding gene (xylE) as a reporter gene, was used to analyze the sequence upstream from the pcbC gene for promoter activity. Introduction of an SphI site at the start codon of pcbC by site-directed mutagenesis allowed the cloning of a 335-bp fragment (-334 to +1 in relation to the pcbC start codon) immediately upstream from xylE in pIJ4083. C23O activity was detected in both Streptomyces lividans and S. clavuligerus cultures that contained the upstream fragment, suggesting the presence of a promoter sequence. Northern analysis of total RNA extracted from S. clavuligerus identified a monocistronic 1.2-kb transcript hybridizing to a pcbC-specific probe. When RNA was isolated at various times during growth in liquid culture, the presence of a transcript was first detected during stationary phase. Analysis of the pcbC transcript by primer extension located the transcription start point to a C residue within the upstream ORF, 91 bp upstream from the pcbC start codon.	1
Title: A gene cluster for the biosynthesis of moenomycin family antibiotics in the genome of teicoplanin producer Actinoplanes teichomyceticus Abstract: Moenomycins are phosphoglycolipid antibiotics notable for their extreme potency, unique mode of action, and proven record of use in animal nutrition without selection for resistant microflora. There is a keen interest in manipulation of structures of moenomycins in order to better understand their structure-activity relationships and to generate improved analogs. Only two almost identical moenomycin biosynthetic gene clusters are known, limiting our knowledge of the evolution of moenomycin pathways and our ability to genetically diversify them. Here, we report a novel gene cluster (tchm) that directs production of the phosphoglycolipid teichomycin in Actinoplanes teichomyceticus. Its overall genetic architecture is significantly different from that of the moenomycin biosynthesis (moe) gene clusters of Streptomyces ghanaensis and Streptomyces clavuligerus, featuring multiple gene rearrangements and two novel structural genes. Involvement of the tchm cluster in teichomycin biosynthesis was confirmed via heterologous co-expression of amidotransferase tchmH5 and moe genes. Our work sets the background for further engineering of moenomycins and for deeper inquiries into the evolution of this fascinating biosynthetic pathway.	1
Title: Genetic mapping of targets mediating differential chemical phenotypes in Plasmodium falciparum Abstract: Studies of gene function and molecular mechanisms in Plasmodium falciparum are hampered by difficulties in characterizing and measuring phenotypic differences between individual parasites. We screened seven parasite lines for differences in responses to 1,279 bioactive chemicals. Hundreds of compounds were active in inhibiting parasite growth; 607 differential chemical phenotypes, defined as pairwise IC(50) differences of fivefold or more between parasite lines, were cataloged. We mapped major determinants for three differential chemical phenotypes between the parents of a genetic cross, and we identified target genes by fine mapping and testing the responses of parasites in which candidate genes were genetically replaced with mutant alleles. Differential sensitivity to dihydroergotamine methanesulfonate (1), a serotonin receptor antagonist, was mapped to a gene encoding the homolog of human P-glycoprotein (PfPgh-1). This study identifies new leads for antimalarial drugs and demonstrates the utility of a high-throughput chemical genomic strategy for studying malaria traits.	0
Title: Stereocontrolled synthesis of spirooxindoles through Lewis acid-promoted [5 + 2]-annulation of chiral silyl alcohols Abstract: The enantioselective synthesis of stereochemically and structurally diverse spirocyclic oxindoles by [5 + 2]-annulation of chiral crotylsilanes bearing a primary alcohol is described. The annulation products were further elaborated to polycyclic oxindoles by Pd(0) catalysis.	0
Title: Decreased accumulation or increased isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase activity confers resistance to the cyclic beta-amino acid BAY 10-8888 in Candida albicans and Candida tropicalis Abstract: BAY 10-8888, a cyclic beta-amino acid, exerts its antifungal activity by inhibition of isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase activity after accumulation to a millimolar concentration inside the cell. We have selected and characterized BAY 10-8888-resistant Candida albicans mutants. Reduced BAY 10-8888 accumulation as well as increased isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase activity was observed in these mutants. Some of the mutants were cross-resistant to cispentacin, a structurally related beta-amino acid, while sensitivities to 5-fluorocytosine and fluconazole remained unchanged in all mutants. All except two in vitro-resistant mutants were pathogenic in a murine candidiasis model, and BAY 10-8888 failed to cure the infection. Furthermore, we have characterized BAY 10-8888 transport and isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase activity in several Candida tropicalis strains which showed MICs higher than those of other Candida strains. An analysis of the C. tropicalis strains revealed that intracellular concentrations of BAY 10-8888 were in the millimolar range, comparable to those for C. albicans. However, these isolates expressed isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase activities about fourfold higher than those for C. albicans. To test the possibility of resistance modeling, we determined the correlations between the intracellular concentration of BAY 10-8888, the specific activity of isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase, the number of free, i.e., noninhibited, isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase molecules/cell, and growth, assuming a linear relation. We found significant correlations between growth and the intracellular concentration of BAY 10-8888 and between growth and the number of free isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase molecules/cell, but not between growth and the specific activity of isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase.	0
Title: RNA architecture dictates the conformations of a bound peptide Abstract: Background:                       The biological function of several viral and bacteriophage proteins, and their arginine-rich subdomains, involves RNA-mediated interactions. It has been shown recently that bound peptides adopt either beta-hairpin or alpha-helical conformations in viral and phage peptide-RNA complexes. We have compared the structures of the arginine-rich peptide domain of HIV-1 Rev bound to two RNA aptamers to determine whether RNA architecture can dictate the conformations of a bound peptide.                  Results:                       The core-binding segment of the HIV-1 Rev peptide class II RNA aptamer complex spans the two-base bulge and hairpin loop of the bound RNA and the carboxy-terminal segment of the bound peptide. The bound peptide is anchored in place by backbone and sidechain intermolecular hydrogen bonding and van der Waals stacking interactions. One of the bulge bases participates in U*(A*U) base triple formation, whereas the other is looped out and flaps over the bound peptide in the complex. The seven-residue hairpin loop is closed by a sheared G*A mismatch pair with several pyrimidines looped out of the hairpin fold.                  Conclusions:                       Our structural studies establish that RNA architecture dictates whether the same HIV-1 Rev peptide folds into an extended or alpha-helical conformation on complex formation. Arginine-rich peptides can therefore adapt distinct secondary folds to complement the tertiary folds of their RNA targets. This contrasts with protein-RNA complexes in which elements of RNA secondary structure adapt to fit within the tertiary folds of their protein targets.	0
Title: MS/MS-based networking and peptidogenomics guided genome mining revealed the stenothricin gene cluster in Streptomyces roseosporus Abstract: Most (75%) of the anti-infectives that save countless lives and enormously improve quality of life originate from microbes found in nature. Herein, we described a global visualization of the detectable molecules produced from a single microorganism, which we define as the 'molecular network' of that organism, followed by studies to characterize the cellular effects of antibacterial molecules. We demonstrate that Streptomyces roseosporus produces at least four non-ribosomal peptide synthetase-derived molecular families and their gene subnetworks (daptomycin, arylomycin, napsamycin and stenothricin) were identified with different modes of action. A number of previously unreported analogs involving truncation, glycosylation, hydrolysis and biosynthetic intermediates and/or shunt products were also captured and visualized by creation of a map through MS/MS networking. The diversity of antibacterial compounds produced by S. roseosporus highlights the importance of developing new approaches to characterize the molecular capacity of an organism in a more global manner. This allows one to more deeply interrogate the biosynthetic capacities of microorganisms with the goal to streamline the discovery pipeline for biotechnological applications in agriculture and medicine. This is a contribution to a special issue to honor Chris Walsh's amazing career.	1
Title: Structural and functional characterization of three polyketide synthase gene clusters in Bacillus amyloliquefaciens FZB 42 Abstract: Although bacterial polyketides are of considerable biomedical interest, the molecular biology of polyketide biosynthesis in Bacillus spp., one of the richest bacterial sources of bioactive natural products, remains largely unexplored. Here we assign for the first time complete polyketide synthase (PKS) gene clusters to Bacillus antibiotics. Three giant modular PKS systems of the trans-acyltransferase type were identified in Bacillus amyloliquefaciens FZB 42. One of them, pks1, is an ortholog of the pksX operon with a previously unknown function in the sequenced model strain Bacillus subtilis 168, while the pks2 and pks3 clusters are novel gene clusters. Cassette mutagenesis combined with advanced mass spectrometric techniques such as matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry and liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization mass spectrometry revealed that the pks1 (bae) and pks3 (dif) gene clusters encode the biosynthesis of the polyene antibiotics bacillaene and difficidin or oxydifficidin, respectively. In addition, B. subtilis OKB105 (pheA sfp(0)), a transformant of the B. subtilis 168 derivative JH642, was shown to produce bacillaene, demonstrating that the pksX gene cluster directs the synthesis of that polyketide. The GenBank accession numbers for gene clusters pks1(bae), pks2, and pks3(dif) are AJ 634060.2, AJ 6340601.2, and AJ 6340602.2, respectively.	1
Title: novE and novG act as positive regulators of novobiocin biosynthesis Abstract: The biosynthetic gene cluster of the aminocoumarin antibiotic novobiocin contains two putative regulatory genes, i.e., novE and novG. Functional proof for the role of NovG as a positive regulator of novobiocin biosynthesis had been provided previously, and we now investigated the role of novE. Heterologous expression experiments with the novobiocin biosynthetic gene cluster showed that the entire putative promoter region of novE is required to achieve optimal novobiocin production. Overexpression of novE, using a replicative vector, resulted in an increase of novobiocin formation. In contrast, inactivation of novE by in frame deletion resulted in a strong reduction of novobiocin biosynthesis. Novobiocin production could be restored by an intact copy of novE, but also by the regulatory gene novG. These observations suggest that novE is a positive regulator of novobiocin biosynthesis. NovE was expressed in E. coli and purified. However, in contrast to parallel experiments with NovG, no DNA-binding properties could be shown for NovE. RT-PCR experiments showed that expression of novG was detectable in the absence of NovE, and also that expression of novE occurred in absence of NovG.	1
Title: Structures and Biosynthetic Pathway of Pulvomycins B-D: 22-Membered Macrolides from an Estuarine Streptomyces sp Abstract: Pulvomycins B-D (1-3) were discovered from an estuarine Streptomyces strain along with the known pulvomycin (4). The 22-membered macrocyclic lactone structures of 1-3 were determined based on the interpretation of NMR, UV, and MS data, the modified Mosher's method, and Kishi's bidentate chiral solvent NMR spectroscopy. Genomic analysis of the bacterial strain revealed the biosynthetic gene cluster of pulvomycin and enabled us to propose the trans-acyltransferase polyketide biosynthetic pathway. Pulvomycin D displayed potent cytotoxic activity against various cancer cell lines.	1
Title: The pcsA gene from Streptomyces diastaticus var. 108 encodes a polyene carboxamide synthase with broad substrate specificity for polyene amides biosynthesis Abstract: Two structurally related polyene macrolides are produced by Streptomyces diastaticus var. 108: rimocidin (3a) and CE-108 (2a). Both bioactive metabolites are biosynthesized from the same pathway through type I polyketide synthases by choosing a starter unit either acetate or butyrate, resulting in 2a or 3a formation, respectively. Two additional polyene amides, CE-108B (2b) and rimocidin B (3b), are also produced "in vivo" when this strain was genetically modified by transformation with engineered SCP2*-derived vectors carrying the ermE gene. The two polyene amides, 2b and 3b, showed improved pharmacological properties, and are generated by a tailoring activity involved in the conversion of the exocyclic carboxylic group of 2a and 3a into their amide derivatives. The improvement on some biological properties of the resulting polyenes, compared with that of the parental compounds, encourages our interest for isolating the tailoring gene responsible for the polyene carboxamide biosynthesis, aimed to use it as tool for generating new bioactive compounds. In this work, we describe the isolation from S. diastaticus var. 108 the corresponding gene, pcsA, encoding a polyene carboxamide synthase, belonging to the Class II glutamine amidotransferases and responsible for "in vivo" and "in vitro" formation of CE-108B (2b) and rimocidin B (3b). The fermentation broth from S. diastaticus var. 108 engineered with the appropriate pcsA gene construction, showed the polyene amides to be the major bioactive compounds.	1
Title: The muscle specificity and structure of two closely related fast-twitch white muscle myosin heavy chain isozymes Abstract: The structures of the heavy chains of fast-twitch white muscle myosin isolated from a number of specific rabbit muscles were examined by the technique of tryptic peptide mapping of iodinated proteins from sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gels. The results suggest that the distribution of the two closely related heavy chain isozymes postulated to exist by Starr and Offer ((1973) J. Mol. Biol. 81, 17-31) vary in a muscle-specific manner. One isozyme appears to be preferentially located in the extensor digitorum longus muscle, while the other appears to be preferentially located in the semitendinosus muscle. Other muscles, such as the gastrocnemius and the latissimus dorsi, appear to contain the two isozymes in a nearly 1:1 ratio. Fine structure mapping of myosin fragments revealed that the two muscle-specific isozymes differ in a number of locations throughout the head and tail portions of the myosin heavy chain.	0
Title: Bell's theorem for temporal order Abstract: Time has a fundamentally different character in quantum mechanics and in general relativity. In quantum theory events unfold in a fixed order while in general relativity temporal order is influenced by the distribution of matter. When matter requires a quantum description, temporal order is expected to become non-classical-a scenario beyond the scope of current theories. Here we provide a direct description of such a scenario. We consider a thought experiment with a massive body in a spatial superposition and show how it leads to entanglement of temporal orders between time-like events. This entanglement enables accomplishing a task, violation of a Bell inequality, that is impossible under local classical temporal order; it means that temporal order cannot be described by any pre-defined local variables. A classical notion of a causal structure is therefore untenable in any framework compatible with the basic principles of quantum mechanics and classical general relativity.	0
Title: A point mutation in ftmD blocks the fumitremorgin biosynthetic pathway in Aspergillus fumigatus strain Af293 Abstract: Fumitremorgins (FTMs), tremorgenic mycotoxins produced by the human pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus, are prenylated indole alkaloids that have been extensively studied in view of their diverse chemical structures and biological activities. Their biosynthetic gene (ftm) cluster was identified on the basis of the genome sequence of A. fumigatus. However, it has been reported that the ftm cluster in genome reference strain Af293 is inactive, which makes complete understanding of the FTM pathway difficult. Hence, we used an FTM-producing strain of A. fumigatus, BM939, to dissect the FTM pathway. Here, we delineate the genetic determinant for the observed defect in the FTM pathway in A. fumigatus Af293. Metabolite profiling and sequence comparison of the two strains revealed a point mutation in ftmD as a possible cause of altered metabolite production in strain Af293. FTM production in Af293 was restored when a DNA fragment containing ftmD from BM939 was introduced. Biochemical analysis indicated that FtmD is a methyltransferase that catalyzes the conversion of 6-hydroxytryprostatin B into tryprostatin A. The mutated FtmD retained enzymatic activity but did not function under physiological conditions, resulting in blockage of the FTM pathway in A. fumigatus Af293.	1
Title: On the nutritional and therapeutic effects of ketone body D-β-hydroxybutyrate Abstract: D-β-hydroxybutyrate (D-3HB), a monomer of microbial polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB), is also a natural ketone body produced during carbohydrate deprivation to provide energy to the body cells, heart, and brain. In recent years, increasing evidence demonstrates that D-3HB can induce pleiotropic effects on the human body which are highly beneficial for improving physical and metabolic health. Conventional ketogenic diet (KD) or exogenous ketone salts (KS) and esters (KE) have been used to increase serum D-3HB level. However, strict adaptation to the KD was often associated with poor patient compliance, while the ingestion of KS caused gastrointestinal distresses due to excessive consumption of minerals. As for ingestion of KE, subsequent degradation is required before releasing D-3HB for absorption, making these methods somewhat inferior. This review provides novel insights into a biologically synthesized D-3HB (D-3-hydroxybutyric acid) which can induce a faster increase in plasma D-3HB compared to the use of KD, KS, or KE. It also emphasizes on the most recent applications of D-3HB in different fields, including its use in improving exercise performance and in treating metabolic or age-related diseases. Ketones may become a fourth micro-nutrient that is necessary to the human body along with carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. Indeed, D-3HB being a small molecule with multiple signaling pathways within the body exhibits paramount importance in mitigating metabolic and age-related diseases. Nevertheless, specific dose-response relationships and safety margins of using D-3HB remain to be elucidated with more research. KEY POINTS: • D-3HB induces pleiotropic effects on physical and metabolic health. • Exogenous ketone supplements are more effective than ketogenic diet. • d-3HB as a ketone supplement has long-term healthy impact.	0
Title: Dominant oceanic bacteria secure phosphate using a large extracellular buffer Abstract: The ubiquitous SAR11 and Prochlorococcus bacteria manage to maintain a sufficient supply of phosphate in phosphate-poor surface waters of the North Atlantic subtropical gyre. Furthermore, it seems that their phosphate uptake may counter-intuitively be lower in more productive tropical waters, as if their cellular demand for phosphate decreases there. By flow sorting (33)P-phosphate-pulsed (32)P-phosphate-chased cells, we demonstrate that both Prochlorococcus and SAR11 cells exploit an extracellular buffer of labile phosphate up to 5-40 times larger than the amount of phosphate required to replicate their chromosomes. Mathematical modelling is shown to support this conclusion. The fuller the buffer the slower the cellular uptake of phosphate, to the point that in phosphate-replete tropical waters, cells can saturate their buffer and their phosphate uptake becomes marginal. Hence, buffer stocking is a generic, growth-securing adaptation for SAR11 and Prochlorococcus bacteria, which lack internal reserves to reduce their dependency on bioavailable ambient phosphate.	0
Title: The biosynthetic gene cluster of zorbamycin, a member of the bleomycin family of antitumor antibiotics, from Streptomyces flavoviridis ATCC 21892 Abstract: The biosynthetic gene cluster for the glycopeptide-derived antitumor antibiotic zorbamycin (ZBM) was cloned by screening a cosmid library of Streptomyces flavoviridis ATCC 21892. Sequence analysis revealed 40 ORFs belonging to the ZBM biosynthetic gene cluster. However, only 23 and 22 ORFs showed striking similarities to the biosynthetic gene clusters for the bleomycins (BLMs) and tallysomycins (TLMs), respectively; the remaining ORFs do not show significant homology to ORFs from the related BLM and TLM clusters. The ZBM gene cluster consists of 16 nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) genes encoding eight complete NRPS modules, three incomplete didomain NRPS modules, and eight freestanding single NRPS domains or associated enzymes, a polyketide synthase (PKS) gene encoding one PKS module, six sugar biosynthesis genes, as well as genes encoding other biosynthesis and resistance proteins. A genetic system using Escherichia coli-Streptomyces flavoviridis intergeneric conjugation was developed to enable ZBM gene cluster boundary determinations and biosynthetic pathway manipulations.	1
Title: Ancestral polymorphism and adaptive evolution in the trichothecene mycotoxin gene cluster of phytopathogenic Fusarium Abstract: Filamentous fungi within the Fusarium graminearum species complex (Fg complex) are the primary etiological agents of Fusarium head blight (scab) of wheat and barley. Scab is an economically devastating plant disease that greatly limits grain yield and quality. In addition, scabby grain is often contaminated with trichothecene mycotoxins that act as virulence factors on some hosts, and pose a serious threat to animal health and food safety. Strain-specific differences in trichothecene metabolite profiles (chemotypes) are not well correlated with the Fg complex phylogeny based on genealogical concordance at six single-copy nuclear genes. To examine the basis for this discord between species and toxin evolution, a 19-kb region of the trichothecene gene cluster was sequenced in 39 strains chosen to represent the global genetic diversity of species in the Fg complex and four related species of Fusarium. Phylogenetic analyses demonstrated that polymorphism within these virulence-associated genes is transspecific and appears to have been maintained by balancing selection acting on chemotype differences that originated in the ancestor of this important group of plant pathogens. Chemotype-specific differences in selective constraint and evidence of adaptive evolution within trichothecene genes are also reported.	1
Title: Complete genome sequence of Streptomyces globisporus C-1027, the producer of an enediyne antibiotic lidamycin Abstract: Streptomyces globisporus C-1027 produces a nine-membered enediyne antitumor antibiotic lidamycin. Here we report the complete genome sequence of S. globisporus C-1027, which consists of a 7,608,611 bp linear chromosome, a 167,754 bp linear plasmid SGLP1 and a 7,234 bp circular plasmid pSGL1. The biosynthetic gene cluster for lidamycin was located in the linear plasmid SGLP1. Genome analysis also revealed a number of genes related to biosynthesis of diverse secondary metabolites. The genome sequence of C-1027 will enable us to disclose biosynthetic pathways of these secondary metabolites and discover new natural products with potential applications notably in human health.	1
Title: Characterization of the biosynthetic gene cluster for maklamicin, a spirotetronate-class antibiotic of the endophytic Micromonospora sp. NBRC 110955 Abstract: Maklamicin, which is produced by the endophytic Micromonospora sp. NBRC 110955, is a spirotetronate-class antibiotic possessing anti-microbial activity against Gram-positive bacteria, and has several unique structural features different from other spirotetronates. Here we describe identification and characterization of the maklamicin biosynthetic (mak) gene cluster through draft genome sequencing, genomic library screening, and gene disruption. Sequence analysis revealed that a plausible maklamicin cluster resides in a 152 kb DNA region encoding 46 open reading frames, 24 of which can be assigned roles in the biosynthesis of polyketide backbone, spirotetronate or peripheral moieties, self-resistance and the regulation of maklamicin production. Disruption of the polyketide synthase (PKS) genes makA1 or makA4 resulted in a complete loss of maklamicin production, indicating that the type I modular PKS system is responsible for the biosynthesis of maklamicin. The mak gene cluster contained a set of biosynthetic genes for the formation of a tetronate moiety, which were found to be highly conserved in the gene clusters for spirotetronate antibiotics. Based on the estimated biosynthetic genes, we propose the biosynthetic pathway for maklamicin. Our findings provide not only insights on the biosynthetic mechanism of the unique structures in maklamicin, but also useful information to facilitate a comparative analysis of the spirotetronate biosynthetic pathways to expand the structural repertoire.	1
Title: Characterization and utilization of methyltransferase for apramycin production in Streptoalloteichus tenebrarius Abstract: A structurally unique aminoglycoside produced in Streptoalloteichus tenebrarius, Apramycin is used in veterinary medicine or the treatment of Salmonella, Escherichia coli, and Pasteurella multocida infections. Although apramycin was discovered nearly 50 years ago, many biosynthetic steps of apramycin remain unknown. In this study, we identified a HemK family methyltransferase, AprI, to be the 7'-N-methyltransferase in apramycin biosynthetic pathway. Biochemical experiments showed that AprI converted demethyl-aprosamine to aprosamine. Through gene disruption of aprI, we identified a new aminoglycoside antibiotic demethyl-apramycin as the main product in aprI disruption strain. The demethyl-apramycin is an impurity in apramycin product. In addition to demethyl-apramycin, carbamyltobramycin is another major impurity. However, unlike demethyl-apramycin, tobramycin is biosynthesized by an independent biosynthetic pathway in S. tenebrarius. The titer and rate of apramycin were improved by overexpression of the aprI and disruption of the tobM2, which is a crucial gene for tobramycin biosynthesis. The titer of apramycin increased from 2227 ± 320 mg/L to 2331 ± 210 mg/L, while the titer of product impurity demethyl-apramycin decreased from 196 ± 36 mg/L to 51 ± 9 mg/L. Moreover, the carbamyltobramycin titer of the wild-type strain was 607 ± 111 mg/L and that of the engineering strain was null. The rate of apramycin increased from 68% to 87% and that of demethyl-apramycin decreased from 1.17% to 0.34%.	0
Title: Microbial biosynthesis of medium-chain 1-alkenes by a nonheme iron oxidase Abstract: Aliphatic medium-chain 1-alkenes (MCAEs, ∼10 carbons) are "drop-in" compatible next-generation fuels and precursors to commodity chemicals. Mass production of MCAEs from renewable resources holds promise for mitigating dependence on fossil hydrocarbons. An MCAE, such as 1-undecene, is naturally produced by Pseudomonas as a semivolatile metabolite through an unknown biosynthetic pathway. We describe here the discovery of a single gene conserved in Pseudomonas responsible for 1-undecene biosynthesis. The encoded enzyme is able to convert medium-chain fatty acids (C10-C14) into their corresponding terminal olefins using an oxygen-activating, nonheme iron-dependent mechanism. Both biochemical and X-ray crystal structural analyses suggest an unusual mechanism of β-hydrogen abstraction during fatty acid substrate activation. Our discovery unveils previously unidentified chemistry in the nonheme Fe(II) enzyme family, provides an opportunity to explore the biology of 1-undecene in Pseudomonas, and paves the way for tailored bioconversion of renewable raw materials to MCAE-based biofuels and chemical commodities.	1
Title: A divergent enantioselective strategy for the synthesis of griseusins Abstract: The first enantioselective total synthesis of griseusin A, griseusin C, 4'-deacetyl-griseusin A, and two non-native counterparts in 11-14 steps is reported. This strategy highlights a key hydroxy-directed CH olefination of 1-methylene isochroman with an α,β-unsaturated ketone followed by subsequent stereoselective epoxidation and regioselective cyclization to afford the signature tetrahydro-spiropyran ring. Colorectal cancer cell cytotoxicities of the final products highlight the impact of the griseusin tetrahydro-spiropyran ring on bioactivity. As the first divergent enantioselective synthesis, the strategy put forth sets the stage for further griseusin mechanism-of-action and SAR studies.	0
Title: Purification and characterization of the antimicrobial peptide microcin N Abstract: Microcins are low-molecular-weight proteins secreted by certain bacteria that act by limiting the growth of other bacteria that share the same ecological niche. In the present work, the previous microcin 24 system was resequenced.We detected three nucleotide differences in the microcin-coding gene that partially change the amino acid sequence. According to the present microcin nomenclature, we renamed the five genes constituting this microcin system (mcnRINAB), which are arranged in an operon-like structure: mcnR codes for a putative histone-like nucleoid protein regulator; mcnI codes for the immunity protein; mcnN encodes microcin N; and mcnA and mcnB correspond to an ATP-binding cassette transporter system. Purified microcin N has a molecular weight of 7274.23 Da, as determined by MS. This peptide was stable up to 100°C, resistant to treatment with lipase, lysozyme, trypsin, and chymotrypsin, and susceptible to degradation by proteinase K.	1
Title: An interactive regulatory network controls stress response in Bifidobacterium breve UCC2003 Abstract: Members of the genus Bifidobacterium are gram-positive bacteria that commonly are found in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) of mammals, including humans. Because of their perceived probiotic properties, they frequently are incorporated as functional ingredients in food products. From probiotic production to storage and GIT delivery, bifidobacteria encounter a plethora of stresses. To cope with these environmental challenges, they need to protect themselves through stress-induced adaptive responses. We have determined the response of B. breve UCC2003 to various stresses (heat, osmotic, and solvent) using transcriptome analysis, DNA-protein interactions, and GusA reporter fusions, and we combined these with results from an in silico analysis. The integration of these results allowed the formulation of a model for an interacting regulatory network for stress response in B. breve UCC2003 where HspR controls the SOS response and the ClgR regulon, which in turn regulates and is regulated by HrcA. This model of an interacting regulatory network is believed to represent the paradigm for stress adaptation in bifidobacteria.	0
Title: Crystallization and preliminary X-ray analysis of the aromatic prenyltransferase CloQ from the clorobiocin biosynthetic cluster of Streptomyces roseochromogenes Abstract: Crystals of recombinant CloQ (subunit MW = 35 626 Da; 324 amino acids), an aromatic prenyltransferase from Streptomyces roseochromogenes, were grown by vapour diffusion. The protein crystallizes in space group I4(1)22, with unit-cell parameters a = b = 135.19, c = 98.13 A. Native data from a single crystal were recorded to a resolution of 2.2 A in-house. Preliminary analysis of these data indicated that the asymmetric unit corresponds to a monomer, giving an estimated solvent content of 60.6%. CloQ is involved in the biosynthesis of the aminocoumarin antibiotic clorobiocin, which targets the essential bacterial enzyme DNA gyrase.	1
Title: Cross-talk among gp130 cytokines in adipocytes Abstract: The interleukin-6 (IL-6) family of cytokines is a family of structurally and functionally related proteins, including IL-6, IL-11, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), oncostatin M (OSM), ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), and cardiotrophin-1 (CT-1). These proteins are also known as gp130 cytokines because they all share gp130 as a common transducer protein within their functional receptor complexes. Several of these cytokines (LIF, OSM, CNTF, and CT-1) also utilize the LIF receptor (LIFR) as a component of their receptor complex. We have shown that all of these cytokines are capable of activating both the JAK/STAT and p42/44 mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathways in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. By performing a variety of preincubation studies and examining the ability of these cytokines to activate STATs, ERKs, and induce transcription of SOCS-3 mRNA, we have also examined the ability of gp130 cytokines to modulate the action of their family members. Our results indicate that a subset of gp130 cytokines, in particular CT-1, LIF, and OSM, has the ability to impair subsequent signaling activity initiated by gp130 cytokines. However, IL-6 and CNTF do not exhibit this cross-talk ability. Moreover, our results indicate that the cross-talk among gp130 cytokines is mediated by the ability of these cytokines to induce ligand-dependent degradation of the LIFR, in a proteasome-independent manner, which coincides with decreased levels of LIFR at the plasma membrane. In summary, our results demonstrate that an inhibitory cross-talk among specific gp130 cytokines in 3T3-L1 adipocytes occurs as a result of specific degradation of LIFR via a lysosome-mediated pathway.	0
Title: Breathing and oscillating growth of solid-electrolyte-interphase upon electrochemical cycling Abstract: We report the first direct experimental evidence of the dynamic behavior of the solid-electrolyte-interphase (SEI) on copper electrodes upon electrochemical cycling. Synchrotron-based soft X-ray absorption spectroscopy (sXAS) and time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) consistently show that both the chemical composition and the thickness of the SEI change with electrochemical potential throughout the slow formation process. In particular, sXAS results show that the nascent carbonate species in SEI show redox reversibility and decompose during the delithiation (oxidation) process, which leads to a significant shrinking of the SEI thickness as confirmed by TOF-SIMS. Meanwhile, the carbonates also matures and become more and more inactive at every lithiation (reduction) process. These experimental observations reveal unambiguously that SEI formation is much more complicated than a simple and monotonous deposition of electrolyte decomposition product; instead, it could be an oscillating process with a breathing growth.	0
Title: Biochemical and genetic characterization of enterocin A from Enterococcus faecium, a new antilisterial bacteriocin in the pediocin family of bacteriocins Abstract: A new bacteriocin has been isolated from an Enterococcus faecium strain. The bacteriocin, termed enterocin A, was purified to homogeneity as judged by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, N-terminal amino acid sequencing, and mass spectrometry analysis. By combining the data obtained from amino acid and DNA sequencing, the primary structure of enterocin A was determined. It consists of 47 amino acid residues, and the molecular weight was calculated to be 4,829, assuming that the four cysteine residues form intramolecular disulfide bridges. This molecular weight was confirmed by mass spectrometry analysis. The amino acid sequence of enterocin A shared significant homology with a group of bacteriocins (now termed pediocin-like bacteriocins) isolated from a variety of lactic acid-producing bacteria, which include members of the genera Lactobacillus, Pediococcus, Leuconostoc, and Carnobacterium. Sequencing of the structural gene of enterocin A, which is located on the bacterial chromosome, revealed an N-terminal leader sequence of 18 amino acid residues, which was removed during the maturation process. The enterocin A leader belongs to the double-glycine leaders which are found among most other small nonlantibiotic bacteriocins, some lantibiotics, and colicin V. Downstream of the enterocin A gene was located a second open reading frame, encoding a putative protein of 103 amino acid residues. This gene may encode the immunity factor of enterocin A, and it shares 40% identity with a similar open reading frame in the operon of leucocin AUL 187, another pediocin-like bacteriocin.	1
Title: Structural Characterization and Bioactivity Analysis of the Two-Component Lantibiotic Flv System from a Ruminant Bacterium Abstract: The discovery of new ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptide natural products (RiPPs) has greatly benefitted from the influx of genomic information. The lanthipeptides are a subset of this class of compounds. Adopting the genome-mining approach revealed a novel lanthipeptide gene cluster encoded in the genome of Ruminococcus flavefaciens FD-1, an anaerobic bacterium that is an important member of the rumen microbiota of livestock. The post-translationally modified peptides were produced via heterologous expression in Escherichia coli. Subsequent structural characterization and assessment of their bioactivity revealed features reminiscent of and distinct from previously reported lanthipeptides. The lanthipeptides of R. flavefaciens FD-1 represent a unique example within two-component lanthipeptides, consisting of a highly conserved α-peptide and a diverse set of eight β-peptides.	1
Title: γ-Tubulin complex in Trypanosoma brucei: molecular composition, subunit interdependence and requirement for axonemal central pair protein assembly Abstract: γ-Tubulin complex constitutes a key component of the microtubule-organizing center and nucleates microtubule assembly. This complex differs in complexity in different organisms: the budding yeast contains the γ-tubulin small complex (γTuSC) composed of γ-tubulin, gamma-tubulin complex protein (GCP)2 and GCP3, whereas animals contain the γ-tubulin ring complex (γTuRC) composed of γTuSC and three additional proteins, GCP4, GCP5 and GCP6. In Trypanosoma brucei, the composition of the γ-tubulin complex remains elusive, and it is not known whether it also regulates assembly of the subpellicular microtubules and the spindle microtubules. Here we report that the γ-tubulin complex in T. brucei is composed of γ-tubulin and three GCP proteins, GCP2-GCP4, and is primarily localized in the basal body throughout the cell cycle. Depletion of GCP2 and GCP3, but not GCP4, disrupted the axonemal central pair microtubules, but not the subpellicular microtubules and the spindle microtubules. Furthermore, we showed that the γTuSC is required for assembly of two central pair proteins and that γTuSC subunits are mutually required for stability. Together, these results identified an unusual γ-tubulin complex in T. brucei, uncovered an essential role of γTuSC in central pair protein assembly, and demonstrated the interdependence of individual γTuSC components for maintaining a stable complex.	0
Title: Identification of specific B cell linear epitopes of mycoplasma hyorhinis P37 protein using monoclonal antibodies against baculovirus-expressed P37 protein Abstract: Background:                       Mycoplasma hyorhinis (Mhr) is the etiologic agent of lameness and polyserositis in swine. P37 is a membrane protein of Mhr that may be an important immunogen and is a potential target for diagnostic development. However, there is little information concerning Mhr P37 protein epitopes. A precise analysis of the P37 protein epitopes should extend our understanding of the antigenic composition of the P37 protein and the humoral immune responses to Mhr infection. Investigating the epitopes of Mhr P37 will help to establish a detection method for Mhr in tissue and provide an effective tool for detecting Mhr infection.                  Results:                       Western blot and indirect immunofluorescence assays (IFA) confirmed that the expressed P37 protein was recognized by Mhr-positive porcine and mouse sera. Furthermore, the P37 protein was purified using affinity chromatography and used to immunize mice for hybridoma cell fusion. Four monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) found to be positive for Mhr were detected in infected lung tissue. A panel of truncated P37 proteins was used to identify the minimal B cell linear epitopes of the protein based on these mAbs. The core epitope was determined to be 206KIKKAWNDKDWNTFRNF222. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we identified 17 critical amino acids that determine the epitope of the P37 protein of Mhr. This study identified mAbs that could provide useful tools for investigating the Mhr P37 antigenic core epitope (amino acids 206-222) and detecting Mhr-specific antigens in infected tissue.	0
Title: Characterizing the role of the microtubule binding protein Bim1 in Cryptococcus neoformans Abstract: During sexual development the human fungal pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans undergoes a developmental transition from yeast-form growth to filamentous growth. This transition requires cellular restructuring to form a filamentous dikaryon. Dikaryotic growth also requires tightly controlled nuclear migration to ensure faithful replication and dissemination of genetic material to spore progeny. Although the gross morphological changes that take place during dikaryotic growth are largely known, the molecular underpinnings that control this process are uncharacterized. Here we identify and characterize a C. neoformans homolog of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae BIM1 gene, and establish the importance of BIM1 for proper filamentous growth of C. neoformans. Deletion of BIM1 leads to truncated sexual development filaments, a severe defect in diploid formation, and a block in monokaryotic fruiting. Our findings lead to a model consistent with a critical role for BIM1 in both filament integrity and nuclear congression that is mediated through the microtubule cytoskeleton.	0
Title: Two isozymes of clavaminate synthase central to clavulanic acid formation: cloning and sequencing of both genes from Streptomyces clavuligerus Abstract: Clavaminate synthase (CS) is an alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent oxygenase central to the biosynthesis of clavulanic acid, a potent inhibitor of beta-lactamases. CS catalyzes the oxidative cyclization/desaturation of proclavaminic acid to clavaminic acid in a two-step process involving the intermediacy of dihydroclavaminic acid [Salowe, S. P., Krol, W. J., Iwata-Reuyl, D., & Townsend, C. A. (1991) Biochemistry 30, 2281-2292]. During the purification of CS to homogeneity from Streptomyces clavuligerus [Salowe, S. P., Marsh, E. N., & Townsend, C. A. (1990) Biochemistry 29, 6499-6508], two forms of the enzyme capable of carrying out the complete reaction having very similar molecular weights and kinetic properties were isolated by Mono-Q chromatography. The gene for each has been cloned, sequenced, and found to be significantly homologous (87% identity). The two genes so isolated, cs1 and cs2, have open reading frames of 975 and 978 nucleotides, respectively, encoding proteins of M(r) 35,347 and 35,774. These genes are located in different loci of the genome separated by > 20 kbp. This separation is large for a natural product biosynthetic pathway in bacteria where gene duplication and limited divergence are typically observed to occur within narrower confines of a gene cluster. Sequence comparisons made between cs1/cs2 and other genes encoding iron-dependent proteins involved in penicillin and cephalosporin biosynthesis in the same organism show minimal homology. Further sequence alignments made to other non-heme iron oxygenases reveal unexpected dissimilarity within the alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent class itself. The limited data available suggests evolutionary convergence among these proteins.	1
Title: Decarboxylative arylation of α-amino acids via photoredox catalysis: a one-step conversion of biomass to drug pharmacophore Abstract: The direct decarboxylative arylation of α-amino acids has been achieved via visible light-mediated photoredox catalysis. This method offers rapid entry to prevalent benzylic amine architectures from an abundant biomass, specifically α-amino acid precursors. Significant substrate scope is observed with respect to both the amino acid and arene components.	0
Title: Breaking up is easy to do (if you're a DNA enzyme that cleaves RNA) Abstract: In this issue of Chemistry & Biology, Cruz et al. use in vitro selection to select deoxyribozymes that collectively cleave almost any RNA dinucleotide junction. More remarkable is the finding that the new enzymes are related to the 8-17 deoxyribozyme that cleaves AG dinucleotide junctions.	0
Title: Insight into the haem d1 biosynthesis pathway in heliobacteria through bioinformatics analysis Abstract: Haem d(1) is a unique tetrapyrrole molecule that serves as a prosthetic group of cytochrome cd(1), which reduces nitrite to nitric oxide during the process of denitrification. Very little information is available regarding the biosynthesis of haem d(1). The extreme difficulty in studying the haem d(1) biosynthetic pathway can be partly attributed to the lack of a theoretical basis for experimental investigation. We report here a gene cluster encoding enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of haem d(1) in two heliobacterial species, Heliobacillus mobilis and Heliophilum fasciatum. The gene organization of the cluster is conserved between the two species, and contains a complete set of genes that lead to the biosynthesis of uroporphyrinogen III and genes thought to be involved in the late steps of haem d(1) biosynthesis. Detailed bioinformatics analysis of some of the proteins encoded in the gene cluster revealed important clues to the precise biochemical roles of the proteins in the biosynthesis of haem d(1), as well as the membrane transport and insertion of haem d(1) into an apocytochrome during the maturation of cytochrome cd(1).	1
Title: Purification and properties of the dnaJ replication protein of Escherichia coli Abstract: The Escherichia coli dnaJ gene was originally discovered because mutations in it blocked bacteriophage lambda DNA replication. Some of these mutations were subsequently shown to interfere with bacterial growth at high temperature, suggesting that dnaJ is an essential protein for the host as well. The first step in purifying the dnaJ protein was to overproduce it at least 50-fold by subcloning its gene into the pMOB45 runaway plasmid. The second step was the development of an in vitro system to assay for its activity. A Fraction II extract from dnaJ259 mutant bacteria was shown to be unable to replicate lambda dv DNA unless supplemented with an exogenous source of wild-type dnaJ protein. Using this complementation assay we purified the dnaJ protein to homogeneity from the membrane fraction of an overproducing strain of bacteria. The purified dnaJ protein was shown to be a basic (pI 8.5), yet hydrophobic, protein of Mr 37,000 and 76,000 under denaturing and native conditions, respectively, and to exhibit affinity for both single- and double-stranded DNA. Using a partially purified lambda dv replication system dependent on the presence of the lambda O and P initiator proteins and at least the host dnaB, dnaG, dnaJ, dnaK, single-stranded DNA-binding protein, gyrase, RNA polymerase holoenzyme, and DNA polymerase III holoenzyme, we have shown that the dnaJ protein is required at a very early step in the DNA replication process.	0
Title: Acrophiarin (antibiotic S31794/F-1) from Penicillium arenicola shares biosynthetic features with both Aspergillus- and Leotiomycete-type echinocandins Abstract: The antifungal echinocandin lipopeptide, acrophiarin, was circumscribed in a patent in 1979. We confirmed that the producing strain NRRL 8095 is Penicillium arenicola and other strains of P. arenicola produced acrophiarin and acrophiarin analogues. Genome sequencing of NRRL 8095 identified the acrophiarin gene cluster. Penicillium arenicola and echinocandin-producing Aspergillus species belong to the family Aspergillaceae of the Eurotiomycetes, but several features of acrophiarin and its gene cluster suggest a closer relationship with echinocandins from Leotiomycete fungi. These features include hydroxy-glutamine in the peptide core instead of a serine or threonine residue, the inclusion of a non-heme iron, α-ketoglutarate-dependent oxygenase for hydroxylation of the C3 of the glutamine, and a thioesterase. In addition, P. arenicola bears similarity to Leotiomycete echinocandin-producing species because it exhibits self-resistance to exogenous echinocandins. Phylogenetic analysis of the genes of the echinocandin biosynthetic family indicated that most of the predicted proteins of acrophiarin gene cluster exhibited higher similarity to the predicted proteins of the pneumocandin gene cluster of the Leotiomycete Glarea lozoyensis than to those of the echinocandin B gene cluster from A. pachycristatus. The fellutamide gene cluster and related gene clusters are recognized as relatives of the echinocandins. Inclusion of the acrophiarin gene cluster into a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of echinocandin gene clusters indicated the divergent evolutionary lineages of echinocandin gene clusters are descendants from a common ancestral progenitor. The minimal 10-gene cluster may have undergone multiple gene acquisitions or losses and possibly horizontal gene transfer after the ancestral separation of the two lineages.	1
Title: The relationship between visible intracellular aggregates that appear after overexpression of Sup35 and the yeast prion-like elements [PSI(+)] and [PIN(+)] Abstract: Overproduced fusions of Sup35 or its prion domain with green fluorescent protein (GFP) have previously been shown to form frequent dots in [PSI(+)] cells. Rare foci seen in [psi(-)] cells were hypothesized to indicate the de novo induction of [PSI(+)] caused by the overproduced prion domain. Here, we describe novel ring-type aggregates that also appear in [psi(-)] cultures upon Sup35 overproduction and show directly that dot and ring aggregates only appear in cells that have become [PSI(+)]. The formation of either type of aggregate requires [PIN(+)], an element needed for the induction of [PSI(+)]. Although aggregates are visible predominantly in stationary-phase cultures, [PSI(+)] induction starts in exponential phase, suggesting that much smaller aggregates can also propagate [PSI(+)]. Such small aggregates are probably present in [PSI(+)] cells and, upon Sup35-GFP overproduction, facilitate the frequent formation of dot aggregates, but only the occasional appearance of ring aggregates. In contrast, rings are very frequent when [PSI(+)] cultures, including those lacking [PIN(+)], are grown in the presence of GuHCl or excess Hsp104 while overexpressing Sup35-GFP. Thus, intermediates formed during [PSI(+)] curing seem to facilitate ring formation. Surprisingly, GuHCl and excess Hsp104, which are known to promote loss of [PSI(+)], did not prevent the de novo induction of [PSI(+)] by excess Sup35 in [psi(-)][PIN(+)] strains.	0
Title: Granular layer in the periplasmic space of gram-positive bacteria and fine structures of Enterococcus gallinarum and Streptococcus gordonii septa revealed by cryo-electron microscopy of vitreous sections Abstract: High-resolution structural information on optimally preserved bacterial cells can be obtained with cryo-electron microscopy of vitreous sections. With the help of this technique, the existence of a periplasmic space between the plasma membrane and the thick peptidoglycan layer of the gram-positive bacteria Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus was recently shown. This raises questions about the mode of polymerization of peptidoglycan. In the present study, we report the structure of the cell envelope of three gram-positive bacteria (B. subtilis, Streptococcus gordonii, and Enterococcus gallinarum). In the three cases, a previously undescribed granular layer adjacent to the plasma membrane is found in the periplasmic space. In order to better understand how nascent peptidoglycan is incorporated into the mature peptidoglycan, we investigated cellular regions known to represent the sites of cell wall production. Each of these sites possesses a specific structure. We propose a hypothetic model of peptidoglycan polymerization that accommodates these differences: peptidoglycan precursors could be exported from the cytoplasm to the periplasmic space, where they could diffuse until they would interact with the interface between the granular layer and the thick peptidoglycan layer. They could then polymerize with mature peptidoglycan. We report cytoplasmic structures at the E. gallinarum septum that could be interpreted as cytoskeletal elements driving cell division (FtsZ ring). Although immunoelectron microscopy and fluorescence microscopy studies have demonstrated the septal and cytoplasmic localization of FtsZ, direct visualization of in situ FtsZ filaments has not been obtained in any electron microscopy study of fixed and dehydrated bacteria.	0
Title: Reverse prenyltransferase in the biosynthesis of fumigaclavine C in Aspergillus fumigatus: gene expression, purification, and characterization of fumigaclavine C synthase FGAPT1 Abstract: A putative prenyltransferase gene-fgaPT1-has been identified in the biosynthetic gene cluster of fumigaclavines in Aspergillus fumigatus AF293. The gene was cloned and overexpressed in Escherichia coli, and the His6-fusion FgaPT1 was purified to near homogeneity and characterized biochemically. The enzyme was found to convert fumigaclavine A into fumigaclavine C by attaching a dimethylallyl moiety to C-2 of the indole nucleus in a "reverse" manner, that is, by connection of C-3 of the dimethylallyl moiety to an aromatic nucleus. FgaPT1 is a soluble, dimeric protein with a subunit size of 50 kDa. K m(app) values for fumigaclavine A and dimethylallyl diphosphate were determined to be 6 and 13 microM, respectively, while the turnover number was 0.8 s(-1). Metal ions such as Mg2+ and Ca2+ are not essential for the enzymatic activity. FgaPT1 showed relatively strict substrate specificity towards fumigaclavine A, with only dimethylallyl diphosphate being accepted as a donor under our conditions. FgaPT1 is the first reverse prenyltransferase from fungi to have been purified and characterized in homogenous form after heterologous overproduction. Surprisingly, it shows very low sequence similarity to the recently identified prenyltransferase LtxC from cyanobacteria, which also catalyzes the reverse prenylation of an indole nucleus.	1
Title: Human glycolipid transfer protein (GLTP) genes: organization, transcriptional status and evolution Abstract: Background:                       Glycolipid transfer protein is the prototypical and founding member of the new GLTP superfamily distinguished by a novel conformational fold and glycolipid binding motif. The present investigation provides the first insights into the organization, transcriptional status, phylogenetic/evolutionary relationships of GLTP genes.                  Results:                       In human cells, single-copy GLTP genes were found in chromosomes 11 and 12. The gene at locus 11p15.1 exhibited several features of a potentially active retrogene, including a highly homologous (approximately 94%), full-length coding sequence containing all key amino acid residues involved in glycolipid liganding. To establish the transcriptional activity of each human GLTP gene, in silico EST evaluations, RT-PCR amplifications of GLTP transcript(s), and methylation analyses of regulator CpG islands were performed using various human cells. Active transcription was found for 12q24.11 GLTP but 11p15.1 GLTP was transcriptionally silent. Heterologous expression and purification of the GLTP paralogs showed glycolipid intermembrane transfer activity only for 12q24.11 GLTP. Phylogenetic/evolutionary analyses indicated that the 5-exon/4-intron organizational pattern and encoded sequence of 12q24.11 GLTP were highly conserved in therian mammals and other vertebrates. Orthologs of the intronless GLTP gene were observed in primates but not in rodentiates, carnivorates, cetartiodactylates, or didelphimorphiates, consistent with recent evolutionary development.                  Conclusion:                       The results identify and characterize the gene responsible for GLTP expression in humans and provide the first evidence for the existence of a GLTP pseudogene, while demonstrating the rigorous approach needed to unequivocally distinguish transcriptionally-active retrogenes from silent pseudogenes. The results also rectify errors in the Ensembl database regarding the organizational structure of the actively transcribed GLTP gene in Pan troglodytes and establish the intronless GLTP as a primate-specific, processed pseudogene marker. A solid foundation has been established for future identification of hereditary defects in human GLTP genes.	0
Title: Bre1 and Ubp8 regulate H2B mono-ubiquitination and the reversible yeast-hyphae transition in Candida albicans Abstract: The reversible yeast-hyphae transition of the human fungal pathogen Candida albicans is tightly linked to its pathogenicity. In this study, we show that histone H2B mono-ubiquitination (H2Bub) at lysine 123 was maintained at a low level in the yeast state, whereas it increased significantly during yeast-to-hyphae transition and decreased when hyphae converted to yeast. The increased H2Bub level is correlated with activation of the hyphal program. H2B ubiquitination and deubiquitination are dynamically regulated by the E3 ligase Bre1 and the deubiquitinase Ubp8 during the reversible yeast-hyphae transition. The functions of Bre1 and Ubp8 in hypha-specific gene (HSG) regulation appears to be direct because both are recruited to the coding regions of HSGs during hyphal induction. The sequential recruitment of Bre1 and Ubp8 to HSGs coding regions is important for the initiation and maintenance of HSG expression. Additionally, Ubp8 contributes to the pathogenicity of C. albicans during early infection in a mouse model. Our study is the first to link H2B ubiquitination to the morphological plasticity and pathogenicity of the human fungal pathogen C. albicans and shed light on potential antifungal treatments.	0
Title: The antibiotic planosporicin coordinates its own production in the actinomycete Planomonospora alba Abstract: Planosporicin is a ribosomally synthesized, posttranslationally modified peptide lantibiotic produced by the actinomycete Planomonospora alba. It contains one methyl-lanthionine and four lanthionine bridges and inhibits cell wall biosynthesis in other Gram-positive bacteria probably by binding to lipid II, the immediate precursor for cell wall biosynthesis. Planosporicin production, which is encoded by a cluster of 15 genes, is confined to stationary phase in liquid culture and to the onset of morphological differentiation when P. alba is grown on agar. This growth phase-dependent gene expression is controlled transcriptionally by three pathway-specific regulatory proteins: an extracytoplasmic function σ factor (PspX), its cognate anti-σ factor (PspW), and a transcriptional activator (PspR) with a C-terminal helix-turn-helix DNA-binding domain. Using mutational analysis, S1 nuclease mapping, quantitative RT-PCR, and transcriptional fusions, we have determined the direct regulatory dependencies within the planosporicin gene cluster and present a model in which subinhibitory concentrations of the lantibiotic function in a feed-forward mechanism to elicit high levels of planosporicin production. We show that in addition to acting as an antibiotic, planosporicin can function as an extracellular signaling molecule to elicit precocious production of the lantibiotic, presumably ensuring synchronous and concerted lantibiotic biosynthesis in the wider population and, thus, the production of ecologically effective concentrations of the antibiotic.	1
Title: Metabolic pathway monitoring of phenalinolactone biosynthesis from Streptomyces sp. Tü6071 by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry coupling Abstract: Rationale:                       A rapid and precise analytical method for the investigation of natural products is required for pathway monitoring of the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites. Phenalinolactones, used in antibiotic research, are produced by Streptomyces sp. Tü6071. For the analysis of those compounds, prior to mass spectrometric analysis, an efficient separation technique is required.                  Methods:                       For the identification of phenalinolactones from liquid cultures of Streptomyces sp. Tü6071, a new method comprising the combination of solid-phase extraction (SPE) prior to liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (LC/ESI-MS/MS) was established. MS/MS product ion scans were applied for phenalinolactone detection and structure elucidation, performed in negative mode and optimized for sensitivity and specificity. For the discovery of new intermediates, a MS/MS precursor ion scan was applied.                  Results:                       Analysis of the extracts revealed that the Oasis® MAX cartridge, containing a quaternary amine functionality, is the most efficient SPE material for purification of phenalinolactones, since it allowed sufficient enrichment and detection of intermediates from the biosynthetic pathway by LC/ESI-MS/MS. Using the precursor ion scan technique, two new secondary metabolites, PL IM1 with m/z 672.6 and PL IM2 with m/z 433.3, have been detected. The structures of the new intermediates are postulated and arranged into the biosynthetic pathway of phenalinolactones.                  Conclusions:                       A precise analytical method was established for the identification of phenalinolactones by combining purification from Streptomyces using SPE prior to LC/ESI-MS/MS. By optimising LC/ESI-MS/MS settings, this method has been successfully applied for pathway monitoring of secondary metabolites. Application of a precursor ion scan allowed for the identification of unknown intermediates in biosynthetic pathways.	1
Title: Chromogenic identification of genetic regulatory signals in Bacillus subtilis based on expression of a cloned Pseudomonas gene Abstract: A method to isolate fragments of DNA that promote gene expression in Bacillus subtilis is described. The system is based on production of catechol 2,3-dioxygenase [CatO2ase; catechol:oxygen 2,3-oxidoreductase (decyclizing), EC 1.13.11.2] encoded by the Pseudomonas putida TOL plasmid gene xylE. The gene was transferred to aB. subtilis/Escherichia coli plasmid vector to construct pTG402. Although xylE is functionally expressed in E. coli, CatO2ase is not detected in B. subtilis unless a fragment of DNA capable of promoting gene expression is ligated into a cleavage site on pTG402 upstream from xylE. Fragments of chromosomal DNA from B. subtilis, Bacillus licheniformis, Bacillus pumilus, and E. coli are shown to promote xylE gene expression in B. subtilis. The special feature of the system is the method of detection: colonies of cells that express xylE become yellow within seconds after selection plates are sprayed with catechol, a colorless substrate that is converted by CatO2ase to the yellow product, 2-hydroxymuconic semialdehyde. The complete nucleotide sequence of xylE is presented. Strong complementarity between the ribosome binding site and 16S rRNA suggests that xylE mRNA translation in B. subtilis may commence at the same site as that recognized by P. putida. Identity of CatO2ase produced in B. subtilis, E. coli, and P. putida support the hypothesis. Our sensitive color assay offers an approach to develop plasmid gene expression vectors for a wide variety of host organisms.	0
Title: Commensal Oral Rothia mucilaginosa Produces Enterobactin, a Metal-Chelating Siderophore Abstract: Next-generation sequencing studies of saliva and dental plaque from subjects in both healthy and diseased states have identified bacteria belonging to the Rothia genus as ubiquitous members of the oral microbiota. To gain a deeper understanding of molecular mechanisms underlying the chemical ecology of this unexplored group, we applied a genome mining approach that targets functionally important biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs). All 45 genomes that were mined, representing Rothia mucilaginosa, Rothia dentocariosa, and Rothia aeria, harbored a catechol-siderophore-like BGC. To explore siderophore production further, we grew the previously characterized R. mucilaginosa ATCC 25296 in liquid cultures, amended with glycerol, which led to the identification of the archetype siderophore enterobactin by using tandem liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Normally attributed to pathogenic gut bacteria, R. mucilaginosa is the first commensal oral bacterium found to produce enterobactin. Cocultivation studies including R. mucilaginosa or purified enterobactin revealed that enterobactin reduced growth of certain strains of cariogenic Streptococcus mutans and pathogenic strains of Staphylococcus aureus Commensal oral bacteria were either unaffected, reduced in growth, or induced to grow adjacent to enterobactin-producing R. mucilaginosa or the pure compound. Taken together with Rothia's known capacity to ferment a variety of carbohydrates and amino acids, our findings of enterobactin production add an additional level of explanation to R. mucilaginosa's prevalence in the oral cavity. Enterobactin is the strongest Fe(III) binding siderophore known, and its role in oral health requires further investigation.IMPORTANCE The communication language of the human oral microbiota is vastly underexplored. However, a few studies have shown that specialized small molecules encoded by BGCs have critical roles such as in colonization resistance against pathogens and quorum sensing. Here, by using a genome mining approach in combination with compound screening of growth cultures, we identified that the commensal oral community member R. mucilaginosa harbors a catecholate-siderophore BGC, which is responsible for the biosynthesis of enterobactin. The iron-scavenging role of enterobactin is known to have positive effects on the host's iron pool and negative effects on host immune function; however, its role in oral health remains unexplored. R. mucilaginosa was previously identified as an abundant community member in cystic fibrosis, where bacterial iron cycling plays a major role in virulence development. With respect to iron's broad biological importance, iron-chelating enterobactin may explain R. mucilaginosa's colonization success in both health and disease.	1
Title: Moxifloxacin population pharmacokinetics and model-based comparison of efficacy between moxifloxacin and ofloxacin in African patients Abstract: Pharmacokinetic exposure and the MIC of fluoroquinolones are important determinants of their efficacy against Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Population modeling was used to describe the steady-state plasma pharmacokinetics of moxifloxacin in 241 tuberculosis (TB) patients in southern Africa. Monte Carlo simulations were applied to obtain the area under the unbound concentration-time curve from 0 to 24 h (fAUC0-24) after daily doses of 400 mg or 800 mg moxifloxacin and 800 mg ofloxacin. The MIC distributions of ofloxacin and moxifloxacin were determined for 197 drug-resistant clinical isolates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. For a specific MIC, the probability of target attainment (PTA) was determined for target fAUC0-24/MIC ratios of ≥53 and ≥100. The PTAs were combined with the MIC distributions to calculate the cumulative fraction of response (CFR) for multidrug-resistant (MDR) Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains. Even with the less stringent target ratio of ≥53, moxifloxacin at 400 mg and ofloxacin at 800 mg achieved CFRs of only 84% and 58% for multidrug-resistant isolates with resistance to an injectable drug, while the 800-mg moxifloxacin dose achieved a CFR of 98%. Using a target ratio of ≥100 for multidrug-resistant strains (without resistance to injectable agents or fluoroquinolones), the CFR was 88% for moxifloxacin and only 43% for ofloxacin, and the higher dose of 800 mg moxifloxacin was needed to achieve a CFR target of >90%. Our results indicate that moxifloxacin is more efficacious than ofloxacin in the treatment of MDR-TB. Further studies should determine the optimal pharmacodynamic target for moxifloxacin in a multidrug regimen and clarify safety issues when it is administered at higher doses.	0
Title: Exploration of type II binding mode: A privileged approach for kinase inhibitor focused drug discovery? Abstract: The ATP site of kinases displays remarkable conformational flexibility when accommodating chemically diverse small molecule inhibitors. The so-called activation segment, whose conformation controls catalytic activity and access to the substrate binding pocket, can undergo a large conformational change with the active state assuming a 'DFG-in' and an inactive state assuming a 'DFG-out' conformation. Compounds that preferentially bind to the DFG-out conformation are typically called 'type II' inhibitors in contrast to 'type I' inhibitors that bind to the DFG-in conformation. This review surveys the large number of type II inhibitors that have been developed and provides an analysis of their crystallographically determined binding modes. Using a small library of type II inhibitors, we demonstrate that more than 200 kinases can be targeted, suggesting that type II inhibitors may not be intrinsically more selective than type I inhibitors.	0
Title: Comparison of two biological aerosol sampling methods Abstract: Two biological aerosol samplers, the Andersen two-stage microbial impactor and the May three-stage glass impinger, were examined to determine the benefits and effectiveness of the May sampler compared with the Andersen sampler, one of the most widely accepted samplers. Side-by-side samples were collected during simulated wastewater spray irrigation dispersion studies. Escherichia coli colony counts and air concentrations were statistically treated to determine the dependability of the May results with respect to the Andersen results. After data pairs containing potentially overloaded Andersen counts were eliminated, a linear regression of the remaining data was performed. It indicates that although the May sampler reports 82% of the Andersen sampler value, the correlation between the two samplers is good with an r2 value of 0.84. This comparison indicates that although there are differences between the two samplers, they do give comparable results and that when both are used in a sampling program, they tend to complement each other.	0
Title: Quorum Sensing in Streptococcus mutans Regulates Production of Tryglysin, a Novel RaS-RiPP Antimicrobial Compound Abstract: The genus Streptococcus encompasses a large bacterial taxon that commonly colonizes mucosal surfaces of vertebrates and is capable of disease etiologies originating from diverse body sites, including the respiratory, digestive, and reproductive tracts. Identifying new modes of treating infections is of increasing importance, as antibiotic resistance has escalated. Streptococcus mutans is an important opportunistic pathogen that is an agent of dental caries and is capable of systemic diseases such as endocarditis. As such, understanding how it regulates virulence and competes in the oral niche is a priority in developing strategies to defend from these pathogens. We determined that S. mutans UA159 possesses a bona fide short hydrophobic peptide (SHP)/Rgg quorum-sensing system that regulates a specialized biosynthetic operon featuring a radical-SAM (S-adenosyl-l-methionine) (RaS) enzyme and produces a ribosomally synthesized and posttranslationally modified peptide (RiPP). The pairing of SHP/Rgg regulatory systems with RaS biosynthetic operons is conserved across streptococci, and a locus similar to that in S. mutans is found in Streptococcus ferus, an oral streptococcus isolated from wild rats. We identified the RaS-RiPP product from this operon and solved its structure using a combination of analytical methods; we term these RiPPs tryglysin A and B for the unusual Trp-Gly-Lys linkage. We report that tryglysins specifically inhibit the growth of other streptococci, but not other Gram-positive bacteria such as Enterococcus faecalis or Lactococcus lactis We predict that tryglysin is produced by S. mutans in its oral niche, thus inhibiting the growth of competing species, including several medically relevant streptococci.IMPORTANCE Bacteria interact and compete with a large community of organisms in their natural environment. Streptococcus mutans is one such organism, and it is an important member of the oral microbiota. We found that S. mutans uses a quorum-sensing system to regulate production of a novel posttranslationally modified peptide capable of inhibiting growth of several streptococcal species. We find inhibitory properties of a similar peptide produced by S. ferus and predict that these peptides play a role in interspecies competition in the oral niche.	1
Title: Complex nested promoters control tissue-specific expression of acetyl-CoA carboxylase genes in wheat Abstract: Cis-acting regulatory elements of the wheat acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) gene family were identified by comparing the promoter activity of 5' end gene fragments fused to a reporter gene in two transient expression systems: wheat protoplasts and epidermal cells of mature embryos. Expression of the plastid and the cytosolic ACC genes is each driven by two nested promoters responsible for the synthesis of two transcript types. The internal promoter is located in an intron removed from transcripts originating at the first promoter. These complex promoters, which are different for the cytosolic and plastid ACC genes, control tissue-specific expression of the enzymatic activity supplying cytosolic, plastid, and mitochondrial pools of malonyl-CoA. The activity of one such complex promoter, driving expression of one of the cytosolic ACC genes, was studied throughout development of transgenic wheat plants carrying a full-length promoter-reporter gene fusion. High activity of the promoter was detected in the coleoptile, in the upper sheath section of the leaf, on the top surface of the ovary, in some sections of the main veins in the lemma and glume, and in abaxial epidermis hair cells of the lemma, glume, and rachis. The findings are consistent with the developmental and environmental requirements for very-long-chain fatty acids and flavonoids, whose synthesis begins with the ACC reaction in the cytosol of these specific cell types.	0
Title: Investigation of the Streptomyces clavuligerus cephamycin C gene cluster and its regulation by the CcaR protein Abstract: As part of a search for transcriptional regulatory genes, sequence analysis of several previously unsequenced gaps in the cephamycin biosynthetic cluster has revealed the presence in Streptomyces clavuligerus of seven genes not previously described. These include genes encoding an apparent penicillin binding protein and a transport or efflux protein, as well as the CmcI and CmcJ proteins, which catalyze late reactions in the cephamycin biosynthetic pathway. In addition, we discovered a gene, designated pcd, which displays significant homology to genes encoding semialdehyde dehydrogenases and may represent the gene encoding the long-sought-after dehydrogenase involved in the conversion of lysine to alpha-aminoadipate. Finally, two genes, sclU and rhsA, with no obvious function in cephamycin biosynthesis may define the end of the cluster. The previously described CcaR protein displays homology to a number of Streptomyces pathway-specific transcriptional activators. The ccaR gene was shown to be essential for the biosynthesis of cephamycin, clavulanic acid, and non-clavulanic acid clavams. Complementation of a deletion mutant lacking ccaR and the adjacent orf11 and blp genes showed that only ccaR was essential for the biosynthesis of cephamycin, clavulanic acid, and clavams and that mutations in orf11 or blp had no discernible effects. The lack of cephamycin production in ccaR mutants was directly attributable to the absence of biosynthetic enzymes responsible for the early and middle steps of the cephamycin biosynthetic pathway. Complementation of the ccaR deletion mutant resulted in the return of these biosynthetic enzymes and the restoration of cephamycin production.	1
Title: Candida albicans Cyr1, Cap1 and G-actin form a sensor/effector apparatus for activating cAMP synthesis in hyphal growth Abstract: A key virulence trait of Candida albicans is its ability to undergo the yeast-to-hyphal growth transition in response to environmental signals. This transition critically requires a rapid activation of the adenylyl cyclase Cyr1 to generate a cAMP spike. However, the identity of the signal sensors and mechanisms of signal processing and integration remain largely unclear. Recent evidence suggests that some sensors are embedded in Cyr1 itself. To test this hypothesis, we asked whether purified Cyr1 can respond to hyphal induction. Here, we report that Cyr1 co-purifies with Cap1 and G-actin as a tripartite complex which can increase cAMP synthesis in response to hyphal inducing signals in an actin-dependent manner. Cap1 binds Cyr1 and G-actin through its N- and C-terminus respectively. Deleting the G-actin binding sites or treating the complex with the actin toxin latrunculin A or cytochalasin A inhibits the activation of cAMP synthesis. Strains expressing Cap1 mutants lacking the G-actin binding site are impaired in both cAMP synthesis and hyphal morphogenesis. Thus, our findings reveal an essentially intact sensor/effector apparatus composed of Cyr1, Cap1 and G-actin. Furthermore, G-actin's regulatory role in this apparatus may prove to be the missing link whereby cellular actin status knowingly influences cAMP-mediated cellular processes.	0
Title: Discovery and biosynthesis of guanipiperazine from a NRPS-like pathway Abstract: Nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) are modular enzymes that use a thiotemplate mechanism to assemble the peptide backbones of structurally diverse and biologically active natural products in bacteria and fungi. Unlike these canonical multi-modular NRPSs, single-module NRPS-like enzymes, which lack the key condensation (C) domain, are rare in bacteria, and have been largely unexplored to date. Here, we report the discovery of a gene cluster (gup) encoding a NRPS-like megasynthetase through genome mining. Heterologous expression of the gup cluster led to the production of two unprecedented alkaloids, guanipiperazines A and B. The NRPS-like enzyme activates two l-tyrosine molecules, reduces them to the corresponding amino aldehydes, and forms an unstable imine product. The subsequent enzymatic reduction affords piperazine, which can be morphed by a P450 monooxygenase into a highly strained compound through C-O bond formation. Further intermolecular oxidative coupling forming the C-C or C-O bond is catalyzed by another P450 enzyme. This work reveals the huge potential of NRPS-like biosynthetic gene clusters in the discovery of novel natural products.	1
Title: Identification of a 12-gene Fusaric Acid Biosynthetic Gene Cluster in Fusarium Species Through Comparative and Functional Genomics Abstract: In fungi, genes involved in biosynthesis of a secondary metabolite (SM) are often located adjacent to one another in the genome and are coordinately regulated. These SM biosynthetic gene clusters typically encode enzymes, one or more transcription factors, and a transport protein. Fusaric acid is a polyketide-derived SM produced by multiple species of the fungal genus Fusarium. This SM is of concern because it is toxic to animals and, therefore, is considered a mycotoxin and may contribute to plant pathogenesis. Preliminary descriptions of the fusaric acid (FA) biosynthetic gene (FUB) cluster have been reported in two Fusarium species, the maize pathogen F. verticillioides and the rice pathogen F. fujikuroi. The cluster consisted of five genes and did not include a transcription factor or transporter gene. Here, analysis of the FUB region in F. verticillioides, F. fujikuroi, and F. oxysporum, a plant pathogen with multiple hosts, indicates the FUB cluster consists of at least 12 genes (FUB1 to FUB12). Deletion analysis confirmed that nine FUB genes, including two Zn(II)2Cys6 transcription factor genes, are required for production of wild-type levels of FA. Comparisons of FUB cluster homologs across multiple Fusarium isolates and species revealed insertion of non-FUB genes at one or two locations in some homologs. Although the ability to produce FA contributed to the phytotoxicity of F. oxysporum culture extracts, lack of production did not affect virulence of F. oxysporum on cactus or F. verticillioides on maize seedlings. These findings provide new insights into the genetic and biochemical processes required for FA production.	1
Title: Cofactor recycling for selective enzymatic biotransformation of cinnamaldehyde to cinnamyl alcohol Abstract: The enzymatic, selective hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde to cinnamyl alcohol is reported here. Yeast alcohol dehydrogenase was used in a substrate-coupled process with cofactor recycling. Both 100% selectivity and aldehyde conversion were achieved within 3 h. The reaction took place under very mild conditions, in the absence of toxic organic solvent. The overall process proved inexpensive and deserves further optimization studies in order to evaluate industrial applications.	0
Title: Halogenase genes in nonribosomal peptide synthetase gene clusters of Microcystis (cyanobacteria): sporadic distribution and evolution Abstract: Cyanobacteria of the genus Microcystis are known to produce secondary metabolites of large structural diversity by nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) pathways. For a number of such compounds, halogenated congeners have been reported along with nonhalogenated ones. In the present study, chlorinated cyanopeptolin- and/or aeruginosin-type peptides were detected by mass spectrometry in 17 out of 28 axenic strains of Microcystis. In these strains, a halogenase gene was identified between 2 genes coding for NRPS modules in respective gene clusters, whereas it was consistently absent when the strains produced only nonchlorinated corresponding congeners. Nucleotide sequences were obtained for 12 complete halogenase genes and 14 intermodule regions of gene clusters lacking a halogenase gene or containing only fragments of it. When a halogenase gene was found absent, a specific, identical excision pattern was observed for both synthetase gene clusters in most strains. A phylogenetic analysis including other bacterial halogenases showed that the NRPS-related halogenases of Microcystis form a monophyletic group divided into 2 subgroups, corresponding to either the cyanopeptolin or the aeruginosin peptide synthetases. The distribution of these peptide synthetase gene clusters, among the tested Microcystis strains, was found in relative agreement with their phylogeny reconstructed from 16S-23S rDNA intergenic spacer sequences, whereas the distribution of the associated halogenase genes appears to be sporadic. The presented data suggest that in cyanobacteria these prevalent halogenase genes originated from an ancient horizontal gene transfer followed by duplication in the cyanobacterial lineage. We propose an evolutionary scenario implying repeated gene losses to explain the distribution of halogenase genes in 2 NRPS gene clusters that subsequently defines the seemingly erratic production of halogenated and nonhalogenated aeruginosins and cyanopeptolins among Microcystis strains.	1
Title: Mechanism and Origins of Chemo- and Stereoselectivities of Aryl Iodide-Catalyzed Asymmetric Difluorinations of β-Substituted Styrenes Abstract: The mechanism of the aryl iodide-catalyzed asymmetric migratory geminal difluorination of β-substituted styrenes ( Banik et al. Science 2016, 353, 51 ) has been explored with density functional theory computations. The computed mechanism consists of (a) activation of iodoarene difluoride (ArIF2), (b) enantiodetermining 1,2-fluoroiodination, (c) bridging phenonium ion formation via SN2 reductive displacement, and (d) regioselective fluoride addition. According to the computational model, the ArIF2 intermediate is stabilized through halogen-π interactions between the electron-deficient iodine(III) center and the benzylic substituents at the catalyst stereogenic centers. Interactions with the catalyst ester carbonyl groups (I(III)+···O) are not observed in the unactivated complex, but do occur upon activation of ArIF2 through hydrogen-bonding interactions with external Brønsted acid (HF). The 1,2-fluoroiodination occurs via alkene complexation to the electrophilic, cationic I(III) center followed by C-F bond formation anti to the forming C-I bond. The bound olefin and the C-I bond of catalyst adopt a spiro arrangement in the favored transition structures but a nearly periplanar arrangement in the disfavored transition structures. Multiple attractive non-covalent interactions, including slipped π···π stacking, C-H···O, and C-H···π interactions, are found to underlie the high asymmetric induction. The chemoselectivity for 1,1-difluorination versus 1,2-difluorination is controlled mainly by (1) the steric effect of the substituent on the olefinic double bond and (2) the nucleophilicity of the carbonyl oxygen of substrate.	0
Title: Identification of the gene cluster for the dithiolopyrrolone antibiotic holomycin in Streptomyces clavuligerus Abstract: Streptomyces clavuligerus, an industrially important producer of clavulanate as well as cephem antibiotics, also produces the N-acylated dithiolopyrrolone antibiotic holomycin, a reported inhibitor of RNA synthesis. The genome sequence of S. clavuligerus ATCC 27064 was examined for a potential biosynthetic gene cluster, assuming that holomycin arises from some derivative of an L-Cys-L-Cys dipeptide that has undergone eight-electron oxidation, fused five-five ring formation, and decarboxylation. ORFs 3483-3492 comprise a candidate cluster, with a predicted acyltransferase, a stand-alone nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) module, and four flavin-dependent oxidoreductases. Deletions of ORF3488, the NRPS module, and ORF3489, a phosphopantothenoylcysteine decarboxylase homolog, abolished holomycin production both in wild type and in a holomycin-overproducing mutant. Heterologous expression and purification of ORF3488 allowed demonstration of L-Cys-AMP formation and subsequent covalent tethering of Cys to the phosphopantetheinyl arm of the thiolation domain of this NRPS protein. Purified ORF3483 shows acyltransferase activity, converting holothin to holomycin and longer acylated homologs as the last step in antibiotic assembly.	1
Title: Building fluorescent DNA nanodevices on target living cell surfaces Abstract: We report 1) the anchoring of preformed fluorescent DNA nanodevices (NDs) and 2) the in situ self-assembly of fluorescent DNA NDs on target living cell surfaces. Three types of aptamer-tethered DNA NDs were built and anchored on target cell surfaces by specific target-aptamer association. The in situ nanodevice self-assembly was further demonstrated on the surfaces of target living cells in cell mixtures. These DNA NDs exhibited fluorescence emission and underwent fluorescence energy transfer on living cell surfaces.	0
Title: Cloning and sequencing of the gene encoding the large (alpha-) subunit of the proteasome from Thermoplasma acidophilum Abstract: The gene encoding the alpha-subunit of the proteasome from the archaebacterium Thermoplasma acidophilum was cloned and sequenced. The gene encodes for a polypeptide with 233 amino acid residues and a calculated molecular weight of 25870. Sequence similarity of the alpha-subunit with the Saccharomyces cerevisiae wild-type suppressor gene scll+ encoded polypeptide, which is probably identical with the subunit YC7-alpha of the yeast proteasome, lends support to a putative role of proteasomes in the regulation of gene expression. The significant sequence similarity to the various subunits of eukaryotic proteasomes make it likely that proteasomal proteins are encoded by one gene family of ancient origin.	0
Title: Enhanced acid-stress tolerance in Lactococcus lactis NZ9000 by overexpression of ABC transporters Abstract: Background:                       Microbial cell factories are widely used in the production of acidic products such as organic acids and amino acids. However, the metabolic activity of microbial cells and their production efficiency are severely inhibited with the accumulation of intracellular acidic metabolites. Therefore, it remains a key issue to enhance the acid tolerance of microbial cells. In this study, we investigated the effects of four ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters on acid stress tolerance in Lactococcus lactis.                  Results:                       Overexpressing the rbsA, rbsB, msmK, and dppA genes exhibited 5.8-, 12.2-, 213.7-, and 5.2-fold higher survival rates than the control strain, respectively, after acid shock for 3 h at pH 4.0. Subsequently, transcriptional profile alterations in recombinant strains were analyzed during acid stress. The differentially expressed genes associated with cold-shock proteins (csp), fatty acid biosynthesis (fabH), and coenzyme A biosynthesis (coaD) were up-regulated in the four recombinant strains during acid stress. Additionally, some genes were differentially expressed in specific recombinant strains. For example, in L. lactis (RbsB), genes involved in the pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway (pyrCBDEK) and glycine or betaine transport process (busAA and busAB) were up-regulated during acid stress, and the argG genes showed up-regulations in L. lactis (MsmK). Finally, we found that overexpression of the ABC transporters RbsB and MsmK increased intracellular ATP concentrations to protect cells against acidic damage in the initial stage of acid stress. Furthermore, L. lactis (MsmK) consistently maintained elevated ATP concentrations under acid stress.                  Conclusions:                       This study elucidates the common and specific mechanisms underlying improved acid tolerance by manipulating ABC transporters and provides a further understanding of the role of ABC transporters in acid-stress tolerance.	0
Title: Genome sequencing and analysis of the filamentous fungus Penicillium chrysogenum Abstract: Industrial penicillin production with the filamentous fungus Penicillium chrysogenum is based on an unprecedented effort in microbial strain improvement. To gain more insight into penicillin synthesis, we sequenced the 32.19 Mb genome of P. chrysogenum Wisconsin54-1255 and identified numerous genes responsible for key steps in penicillin production. DNA microarrays were used to compare the transcriptomes of the sequenced strain and a penicillinG high-producing strain, grown in the presence and absence of the side-chain precursor phenylacetic acid. Transcription of genes involved in biosynthesis of valine, cysteine and alpha-aminoadipic acid-precursors for penicillin biosynthesis-as well as of genes encoding microbody proteins, was increased in the high-producing strain. Some gene products were shown to be directly controlling beta-lactam output. Many key cellular transport processes involving penicillins and intermediates remain to be characterized at the molecular level. Genes predicted to encode transporters were strongly overrepresented among the genes transcriptionally upregulated under conditions that stimulate penicillinG production, illustrating potential for future genomics-driven metabolic engineering.	1
Title: Cloning and characterization of monacolin K biosynthetic gene cluster from Monascus pilosus Abstract: Monacolin K is a secondary metabolite synthesized by polyketide synthases (PKS) from Monascus, and it has the same structure as lovastatin, which is mainly produced by Aspergillus terreus. In the present study, a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clone, mps01, was screened from the BAC library constructed from Monascus pilosus BCRC38072 genomic DNA. The putative monacolin K biosynthetic gene cluster was found within a 42 kb region in the mps01 clone. The deduced amino acid sequences encoded by the nine genes designated as mokA- mokI, which share over 54% similarity with the lovastatin biosynthetic gene cluster in A. terreus, were assumed to be involved in monacolin K biosynthesis. A gene disruption construct designed to replace the central part of mokA, a polyketide synthase gene, in wild-type M. pilosus BCRC38072 with a hygromycin B resistance gene through homologous recombination, resulted in a mokA-disrupted strain. The disruptant did not produce monacolin K, indicating that mokA encoded the PKS responsible for monacolin K biosynthesis in M. pilosus BCRC38072.	1
Title: A cluster of structural and regulatory genes for light-induced carotenogenesis in Myxococcus xanthus Abstract: In the bacterium Myxococcus xanthus, several genes for carotenoid synthesis lie together at the carA-carB chromosomal locus and are co-ordinately activated by blue light. A 12-kb DNA stretch from wild-type M. xanthus has been sequenced that includes the entire carA-carB gene cluster. According to sequence analysis, the cluster contains 11 different genes. Intergenic distances are very short or nil (implying translational coupling), giving further support to previous evidence indicating that most (or all) of the genes in the cluster form a single operon. At the promoter region, a potential -35 site for the binding of sigma factors is found. However, the -10 region shows little similarity with analogous sites in other bacterial promoters. Five (possibly six) genes in the carA-carB operon code for enzymes acting on early or late steps of the pathway for carotenoid synthesis. Other genes in the operon show no overall similarity with previously known genes. However, peptide stretches in the predicted products of two genes exhibit strong similarity with the DNA binding domain of the MerR family of transcriptional regulators. At least one of the predicted DNA-binding domains is altered in a mutant strain affected in light-regulation of the car genes.	1
Title: Gatekeeping versus promiscuity in the early stages of the andrimid biosynthetic assembly line Abstract: The antibiotic andrimid, a nanomolar inhibitor of bacterial acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase, is generated on an unusual polyketide/nonribosomal peptide enzyme assembly line in that all thiolation (T) domains/small-molecule building stations are on separate proteins. In addition, a transglutaminase homologue is used to condense andrimid building blocks together on the andrimid assembly line. The first two modules of the andrimid assembly line yields an octatrienoyl-beta-Phe-thioester tethered to the AdmI T domain, with amide bond formation carried out by a free-standing transglutaminase homologue AdmF. Analysis of the aminomutase AdmH reveals its specific conversion from l-Phe to (S)-beta-Phe, which in turn is activated by AdmJ and ATP to form (S)-beta-Phe-aminoacyl-AMP. AdmJ then transfers the (S)-beta-Phe moiety to one of the free-standing T domains, AdmI, but not AdmA, which instead gets loaded with an octatrienoyl group by other enzymes. AdmF, the amide synthase, will accept a variety of acyl groups in place of the octatrienoyl donor if presented on either AdmA or AdmI. AdmF will also use either stereoisomer of phenylalanine or beta-Phe when presented on AdmA and AdmI, but not when placed on noncognate T domains. Further, we show the polyketide synthase proteins responsible for the polyunsaturated acyl cap can be bypassed in vitro with N-acetylcysteamine as a low-molecular-weight acyl donor to AdmF and also in vivo in an Escherichia coli strain bearing the andrimid biosynthetic gene cluster with a knockout in admA.	1
Title: Biosynthesis of the leucine derived α-, β- and γ-hydroxynitrile glucosides in barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) Abstract: Barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) produces five leucine-derived hydroxynitrile glucosides (HNGs), of which only epiheterodendrin is a cyanogenic glucoside. The four non-cyanogenic HNGs are the β-HNG epidermin and the γ-HNGs osmaronin, dihydroosmaronin and sutherlandin. By analyzing 247 spring barley lines including landraces and old and modern cultivars, we demonstrated that the HNG level varies notably between lines whereas the overall ratio between the compounds is constant. Based on sequence similarity to the sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) genes involved in dhurrin biosynthesis, we identified a gene cluster on barley chromosome 1 putatively harboring genes that encode enzymes in HNG biosynthesis. Candidate genes were functionally characterized by transient expression in Nicotiana benthamiana. Five multifunctional P450s, including two CYP79 family enzymes and three CYP71 family enzymes, and a single UDP-glucosyltransferase were found to catalyze the reactions required for biosynthesis of all five barley HNGs. Two of the CYP71 enzymes needed to be co-expressed for the last hydroxylation step in sutherlandin synthesis to proceed. This observation, together with the constant ratio between the different HNGs, suggested that HNG synthesis in barley is organized within a single multi-enzyme complex.	1
Title: Pan-genome analysis identifies intersecting roles for Pseudomonas specialized metabolites in potato pathogen inhibition Abstract: Agricultural soil harbors a diverse microbiome that can form beneficial relationships with plants, including the inhibition of plant pathogens. Pseudomonas spp. are one of the most abundant bacterial genera in the soil and rhizosphere and play important roles in promoting plant health. However, the genetic determinants of this beneficial activity are only partially understood. Here, we genetically and phenotypically characterize the Pseudomonas fluorescens population in a commercial potato field, where we identify strong correlations between specialized metabolite biosynthesis and antagonism of the potato pathogens Streptomyces scabies and Phytophthora infestans. Genetic and chemical analyses identified hydrogen cyanide and cyclic lipopeptides as key specialized metabolites associated with S. scabies inhibition, which was supported by in planta biocontrol experiments. We show that a single potato field contains a hugely diverse and dynamic population of Pseudomonas bacteria, whose capacity to produce specialized metabolites is shaped both by plant colonization and defined environmental inputs.	1
Title: M2@C79N (M = Y, Tb): isolation and characterization of stable endohedral metallofullerenes exhibiting M-M bonding interactions inside aza[80]fullerene cages Abstract: Y2@C79N and Tb2@C79N have been prepared by conducting the Kratschmer-Huffman electric-arc process under 20 Torr of N2 and 280 Torr of He with metal oxide-doped graphite rods. These new heterofullerenes were separated from the resulting mixture of empty cage fullerenes and endohedral fullerenes by chemical separation and a two-stage chromatographic process. Crystallographic data for Tb2@C79N x Ni(OEP) x 2 C6H6 demonstrate the presence of an 80-atom cage with idealized I(h) symmetry and two, widely separated Tb atoms inside with a Tb-Tb separation of 3.9020(10) A for the major terbium sites. The EPR spectrum of the odd-electron Y2@C79N indicates that the spin density largely resides on the two equivalent yttrium ions. Computational studies on Y2@C79N suggest that the nitrogen atom resides at a 665 ring junction in the equator on the fullerene cage and that the unpaired electron is localized in a bonding orbital between the two yttrium ions of this stable radical. Thus, the Tb-Tb bond length of the single-electron bond is an exceedingly long metal-metal bond.	0
Title: Identification of the Biosynthetic Gene Cluster of Thermoactinoamides and Discovery of New Congeners by Integrated Genome Mining and MS-Based Molecular Networking Abstract: The putative non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) gene cluster encoding the biosynthesis of the bioactive cyclohexapeptide thermoactinoamide A (1) was identified in Thermoactinomyces vulgaris DSM 43016. Based on an in silico prediction, the biosynthetic operon was shown to contain two trimodular NRPSs, designated as ThdA and ThdB, respectively. Chemical analysis of a bacterial crude extract showed the presence of thermoactinoamide A (1), thereby supporting this biosynthetic hypothesis. Notably, integrating genome mining with a LC-HRMS/MS molecular networking-based investigation of the microbial metabolome, we succeeded in the identification of 10 structural variants (2-11) of thermoactinoamide A (1), five of them being new compounds (thermoactinoamides G-K, 7-11). As only one thermoactinoamide operon was found in T. vulgaris, it can be assumed that all thermoactinoamide congeners are assembled by the same multimodular NRPS system. In light of these findings, we suggest that the thermoactinoamide synthetase is able to create chemical diversity, combining the relaxed substrate selectivity of some adenylation domains with the iterative and/or alternative use of specific modules. In the frame of our screening program to discover antitumor natural products, thermoactinoamide A (1) was shown to exert a moderate growth-inhibitory effect in BxPC-3 cancer cells in the low micromolar range, while being inactive in PANC-1 and 3AB-OS solid tumor models.	1
Title: The anti-angiogenic agent fumagillin covalently binds and inhibits the methionine aminopeptidase, MetAP-2 Abstract: The inhibition of new blood vessel formation (angiogenesis) is an effective means of limiting both the size and metastasis of solid tumors. The leading anti-angiogenic compound, TNP-470, has proven to be effective in in vitro and in animal model studies, and is currently being tested in phase III antitumor clinical trials. Despite many detailed pharmacological studies, little is known of the molecular mode of action of TNP-470. Using a derivative of the TNP-470 parent compound, the fungal metabolite, fumagillin, we have purified a mammalian protein that is selectively and covalently bound by this natural product. This fumagillin binding protein was found to be a metalloprotease, methionine aminopeptidase (MetAP-2), that is highly conserved between human and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In the absence of MetAP-1, a distantly related methionine aminopeptidase, MetAP-2 function is essential for vegetative growth in yeast. We demonstrate that fumagillin selectively inhibits the S. cerevisiae MetAP-2 protein in vivo. The binding is highly specific as judged by the failure of fumagillin to inhibit MetAP-1 in vivo. Hence, these results identify MetAP-2 as an important target of study in the analysis of the potent biological activities of fumagillin.	1
Title: A new antibiotic, cypemycin. Taxonomy, fermentation, isolation and biological characteristics Abstract: A new peptide antibiotic, cypemycin, with a molecular weight of 2,097 (M+H), was isolated from the culture broth of Streptomyces sp. OH-4156. The antibiotic possesses cytocidal activity against P388 leukemia cells in vitro at a concentration of 1.3 microgram/ml (IC50 values), and the antibiotic showed antimicrobial activities against Micrococcus luteus (MIC, 0.2 microgram/ml).	1
Title: Genetic Screening and Expression Analysis of Psychrophilic Bacillus spp. Reveal Their Potential to Alleviate Cold Stress and Modulate Phytohormones in Wheat Abstract: Abiotic stress in plants pose a major threat to cereal crop production worldwide and cold stress is also notorious for causing a decrease in plant growth and yield in wheat. The present study was designed to alleviate cold stress on plants by inoculating psychrophilic PGPR bacteria belonging to Bacillus genera isolated from extreme rhizospheric environments of Qinghai-Tibetan plateau. The genetic screening of psychrophilic Bacillus spp. CJCL2, RJGP41 and temperate B. velezensis FZB42 revealed presence of genetic features corresponding to cold stress response, membrane transport, signal transduction and osmotic regulation. Subsequently, the time frame study for the expression of genes involved in these pathways was also significantly higher in psychrophilic strains as analyzed through qPCR analysis at 4 ℃. The inoculated cold tolerant Bacillus strains also aided in inducing stress response in wheat by regulating abscisic acid, lipid peroxidation and proline accumulation pathways in a beneficial manner. Moreover, during comparative analysis of growth promotion in wheat all three Bacillus strains showed significant results at 25 ℃. Whereas, psychrophilic Bacillus strains CJCL2 and RJGP41 were able to positively regulate the expression of phytohormones leading to significant improvement in plant growth under cold stress.	0
Title: Cloning, sequencing, analysis, and heterologous expression of the fredericamycin biosynthetic gene cluster from Streptomyces griseus Abstract: Fredericamycin (FDM) A, a pentadecaketide featuring two sets of peri-hydroxy tricyclic aromatic moieties connected through a unique chiral spiro carbon center, exhibits potent cytotoxicity and has been studied as a new type of anticancer drug lead because of its novel molecular architecture. The fdm gene cluster was localized to 33-kb DNA segment of Streptomyces griseus ATCC 49344, and its involvement in FDM A biosynthesis was proven by gene inactivation, complementation, and heterologous expression experiments. The fdm cluster consists of 28 open reading frames (ORFs), encoding a type II polyketide synthase (PKS) and tailoring enzymes as well as several regulatory and resistance proteins. The FDM PKS features a KSalpha subunit with heretofore unseen tandem cysteines at its active site, a KSbeta subunit that is distinct phylogenetically from KSbeta of hexa-, octa-, or decaketide PKSs, and a dedicated phosphopantetheinyl transferase. Further study of the FDM PKS could provide new insight into how a type II PKS controls chain length in aromatic polyketide biosynthesis. The availability of the fdm genes, in vivo characterization of the fdm cluster in S. griseus, and heterologous expression of the fdm cluster in Streptomyces albus set the stage to investigate FDM A biosynthesis and engineer the FDM biosynthetic machinery for the production of novel FDM A analogues.	1
Title: Biosynthetic study of conidiation-inducing factor conidiogenone: heterologous production and cyclization mechanism of a key bifunctional diterpene synthase Abstract: Conidiogenone, a diterpene with a unique structure, is known to induce the conidiation of Penicillium cyclopium. The biosynthetic pathway of (-)-conidiogenone has been fully elucidated by the heterologous expression of biosynthetic genes in Aspergillus oryzae and by in vitro enzyme assay with 13C-labeled substrates. After construction of deoxyconidiogenol by the action of bifunctional terpene synthase, one cytochrome P450 catalyzes two rounds of oxidation to furnish conidiogenone. Notably, similar biosynthetic genes are conserved among more than 10 Penicillium sp., suggesting that conidiogenone is a common conidiation inducer in this genus. The cyclization mechanism catalyzed by terpene synthase, which involves successive 1,2-alkyl shifts, was fully elucidated using 13C-labeled geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP) as substrate. During the structural analysis of deoxyconidiogenol, we observed broadening of some of the 13C signals measured at room temperature, which has not been observed with other structurally related compounds. Careful examination using techniques including 13C NMR studies at -80 °C, conformational analysis and prediction of the 13C chemical shifts using density functional theory gave insights into this intriguing phenomenon.	1
Title: Characterization of two cytochrome P450 monooxygenase genes of the pyripyropene biosynthetic gene cluster from Penicillium coprobium Abstract: Pyripyropenes are potent inhibitors of acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase, which were initially discovered to be produced by Aspergillus fumigatus. Recently, Penicillium coprobium PF1169 has also found to produce pyripyropene A (PyA), which exhibits insecticidal properties. Pyripyropenes are natural hybrid products of both terpenoid and polyketide origin. In our research, based on data generated using the Genome Sequencer FLX for P. coprobium PF1169, we predicted the biosynthetic gene cluster of PyA by blast analysis comparing with polyketide synthase and prenyltransferase of other species. By screening the genomic fosmid library, nine open reading frames (ppb1 to ppb9) related to the biosynthesis of PyA were deduced. Among them, two cytochrome P450 monooxygenase genes (ppb3 and ppb4) were separately introduced into the model fungus A. oryzae. Bioconversion of certain predicted intermediates in the transformants has elucidated the manner of hydroxylation in the biosynthetic pathway by the expressed products of these two genes (P450-1 and P450-2). That is, P450-1 exhibits monooxygenase activity and plays the hydroxylation role at C-11 of pyripyropene E. While P450-2 plays an active role in the hydroxylation of C-7 and C-13 of pyripyropene O.	1
Title: Agrobacterium VirE2 protein mediates nuclear uptake of single-stranded DNA in plant cells Abstract: Agrobacterium genetically transforms plant cells by transferring a single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) copy of the transferred DNA (T-DNA) element, the T-strand, in a complex with Agrobacterium proteins VirD2, bound to the 5' end, and VirE2. VirE2 binds single-stranded nucleic acid cooperatively, fully coating the T-strand, and the protein localizes to the plant cell nucleus when transiently expressed. The coupling of ssDNA binding and nuclear localizing activities suggests that VirE2 alone could mediate nuclear localization of ssDNA. In this study, fluorescently labeled ssDNA accumulated in the plant cell nucleus specifically when microinjected as a complex with VirE2. Microinjected ssDNA alone remained cytoplasmic. Import of VirE2-ssDNA complex into the nucleus via a protein import pathway was supported by (i) the inhibition of VirE2-ssDNA complex import in the presence of wheat germ agglutinin or a nonhydrolyzable GTP analog, both known inhibitors of protein nuclear import, and (ii) the retardation of import when complexes were prepared from a VirE2 mutant impaired in ssDNA binding and nuclear import.	0
Title: Microbial diversity and heterogeneity in sandy subsurface soils Abstract: Microbial community diversity and heterogeneity in saturated and unsaturated subsurface soils from Abbott's Pit in Virginia (1.57, 3.25, and 4.05 m below surface) and Dover Air Force Base in Delaware (6.00 and 7.50 m below surface) were analyzed using a culture-independent small-subunit (SSU) rRNA gene (rDNA)-based cloning approach. Four to six dominant operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were identified in 33 to 100 unique SSU rDNA clones (constituting about 40 to 50% of the total number of SSU rDNA clones in the clone library) from the saturated subsurface samples, whereas no dominant OTUs were observed in the unsaturated subsurface sample. Less than 10% of the clones among samples from different depths at the same location were identical, and the proportion of overlapping OTUs was lower for the samples that were vertically far apart than for adjacent samples. In addition, no OTUs were shared between the Abbott's Pit and Dover samples. The majority of the clones (80%) had sequences that were less than 5% different from those in the current databases. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that most of the bacterial clones were affiliated with members of the Proteobacteria family (90%), gram-positive bacteria (3%), and members of the Acidobacteria family (3%). Principal component analysis revealed that samples from different geographic locations were well separated and that samples from the same location were closely grouped together. In addition, the nonsaturated subsurface samples from Abbott's Pit clustered together and were well separated from the saturated subsurface soil sample. Finally, the overall diversity of the subsurface samples was much lower than that of the corresponding surface soil samples.	0
Title: Sensitive and fast identification of bacteria in blood samples by immunoaffinity mass spectrometry for quick BSI diagnosis Abstract: Bloodstream infections rank among the most serious causes of morbidity and mortality in hospitalized patients, partly due to the long period (up to one week) required for clinical diagnosis. In this work, we have developed a sensitive method to quickly and accurately identify bacteria in human blood samples by combining optimized matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MS) and efficient immunoaffinity enrichment/separation. A library of bacteria reference mass spectra at different cell numbers was firstly built. Due to a reduced sample spot size, the reference spectra could be obtained from as few as 10 to 102 intact bacterial cells. Bacteria in human blood samples were then extracted using antibodies-modified magnetic beads for MS fingerprinting. By comparing the sample spectra with the reference spectra based on a cosine correlation, bacteria with concentrations as low as 500 cells per mL in blood serum and 8000 cells per mL in whole blood were identified. The proposed method was further applied to positive clinical blood cultures (BCs) provided by a local hospital, where Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus were identified. Because of the method's high sensitivity, the BC time required for diagnosis can be greatly reduced. As a proof of concept, whole blood spiked with a low initial concentration (102 or 103 cells per mL) of bacteria was cultured in commercial BC bottles and analysed by the developed method after different BC times. Bacteria were successfully identified after 4 hours of BC. Therefore, an entire diagnostic process could be accurately accomplished within half a day using the newly developed method, which could facilitate the timely determination of appropriate anti-bacterial therapy and decrease the risk of mortality from bloodstream infections.	0
Title: 2-Hydroxysorangiadenosine: Structure and Biosynthesis of a Myxobacterial Sesquiterpene-Nucleoside Abstract: Myxobacteria represent an under-investigated source for biologically active natural products featuring intriguing structural moieties with potential applications, e.g., in the pharmaceutical industry. Sorangiadenosine and the here-discovered 2-hydroxysorangiadenosine are myxobacterial sesquiterpene-nucleosides with an unusual structural moiety, a bicyclic eudesmane-type sesquiterpene. As the biosynthesis of these rare terpene-nucleoside hybrid natural products remains elusive, we investigated secondary metabolomes and genomes of several 2-hydroxysorangiadenosine-producing myxobacteria. We report the isolation and full structure elucidation of 2-hydroxysorangiadenosine and its cytotoxic and antibiotic activities and propose a biosynthetic pathway in the myxobacterium Vitiosangium cumulatum MCy10943T.	1
Title: Biosynthesis of Shearinine: Diversification of a Tandem Prenyl Moiety of Fungal Indole Diterpenes Abstract: The late-stage biosynthetic pathway of the indole diterpene shearinine involving four enzymatic reactions (JanQDOJ) was elucidated by an efficient heterologous expression system using Aspergillus oryzae. Key oxidative cyclization, forming a characteristic A/B bicyclic shearinine core by flavoprotein oxidase, was studied using a substrate analogue and a buffer containing H218O. These experimental data provided evidence that JanO catalyzes two-step oxidation via a hydroxylated product and that the JanO reaction involves the hydride-transfer mechanism.	1
Title: Identification of functionally important conserved trans-membrane residues of bacterial PIB -type ATPases Abstract: Powered by ATP hydrolysis, P(IB) -ATPases drive the energetically uphill transport of transition metals. These high affinity pumps are essential for heavy metal detoxification and delivery of metal cofactors to specific cellular compartments. Amino acid sequence alignment of the trans-membrane (TM) helices of P(IB)-ATPases reveals a high degree of conservation, with ∼ 60-70 fully conserved positions. Of these conserved positions, 6-7 were previously identified to be important for transport. However, the functional importance of the majority of the conserved TM residues remains unclear. To investigate the role of conserved TM residues of P(IB)-ATPases we conducted an extensive mutagenesis study of a Zn(2+)/Cd(2+) P(IB)-ATPase from Rhizobium radiobacter (rrZntA) and seven other P(IB)-ATPases. Of the 38 conserved positions tested, 24 had small effects on metal tolerance. Fourteen mutations compromised in vivo metal tolerance and in vitro metal-stimulated ATPase activity. Based on structural modelling, the functionally important residues line a constricted 'channel', tightly surrounded by the residues that were found to be inconsequential for function. We tentatively propose that the distribution of the mutable and immutable residues marks a possible trans-membrane metal translocation pathway. In addition, by substituting six trans-membrane amino acids of rrZntA we changed the in vivo metal specificity of this pump from Zn(2+)/Cd(2+) to Ag(+).	0
Title: Phosphopantetheinylation and specificity of acyl carrier proteins in the mupirocin biosynthetic cluster Abstract: Acyl carrier proteins are vital for the biosynthesis of fatty acids and polyketides. The mupirocin biosynthetic cluster of Pseudomonas fluorescens encodes eleven type I ACPs embedded in its multifunctional polyketide synthase (PKS) proteins plus five predicted type II ACPs (mAcpA-E) that are known to be essential for mupirocin biosynthesis by deletion and complementation analysis. MupN is a putative Sfp-type phosphopantetheinyl transferase. Overexpression of three type I and three type II mupirocin ACPs in Escherichia coli, with or without mupN, followed by mass spectroscopy revealed that MupN can modify both mupirocin type I and type II ACPs to their holo-form. The endogenous phosphopantetheinyl transferase of E. coli modified mAcpA but not mAcpC or D. Overexpression of the type II ACPs in macp deletion mutants of the mupirocin producer P. fluorescens 10586 showed that they cannot substitute for each other while hybrids between mAcpA and mAcpB indicated that, at least for mAcpB, the C-terminal domain determines functional specificity. Amino acid alignments identified mACPs A and D as having C-terminal extensions. Mutation of these regions generated defective ACPs, the activity of which could be restored by overexpression of the macp genes on separate plasmids.	1
Title: UPLC-MS-ELSD-PDA as a powerful dereplication tool to facilitate compound identification from small-molecule natural product libraries Abstract: The generation of natural product libraries containing column fractions, each with only a few small molecules, using a high-throughput, automated fractionation system, has made it possible to implement an improved dereplication strategy for selection and prioritization of leads in a natural product discovery program. Analysis of databased UPLC-MS-ELSD-PDA information of three leads from a biological screen employing the ependymoma cell line EphB2-EPD generated details on the possible structures of active compounds present. The procedure allows the rapid identification of known compounds and guides the isolation of unknown compounds of interest. Three previously known flavanone-type compounds, homoeriodictyol (1), hesperetin (2), and sterubin (3), were identified in a selected fraction derived from the leaves of Eriodictyon angustifolium. The lignan compound deoxypodophyllotoxin (8) was confirmed to be an active constituent in two lead fractions derived from the bark and leaves of Thuja occidentalis. In addition, two new but inactive labdane-type diterpenoids with an uncommon triol side chain were also identified as coexisting with deoxypodophyllotoxin in a lead fraction from the bark of T. occidentalis. Both diterpenoids were isolated in acetylated form, and their structures were determined as 14S,15-diacetoxy-13R-hydroxylabd-8(17)-en-19-oic acid (9) and 14R,15-diacetoxy-13S-hydroxylabd-8(17)-en-19-oic acid (10), respectively, by spectroscopic data interpretation and X-ray crystallography. This work demonstrates that a UPLC-MS-ELSD-PDA database produced during fractionation may be used as a powerful dereplication tool to facilitate compound identification from chromatographically tractable small-molecule natural product libraries.	0
Title: Microbisporicin gene cluster reveals unusual features of lantibiotic biosynthesis in actinomycetes Abstract: Lantibiotics are ribosomally synthesized, posttranslationally modified peptide antibiotics. The biosynthetic gene cluster for microbisporicin, a potent lantibiotic produced by the actinomycete Microbispora corallina containing chlorinated tryptophan and dihydroxyproline residues, was identified by genome scanning and isolated from an M. corallina cosmid library. Heterologous expression in Nonomuraea sp. ATCC 39727 confirmed that all of the genes required for microbisporicin biosynthesis were present in the cluster. Deletion, in M. corallina, of the gene (mibA) predicted to encode the prepropeptide abolished microbisporicin production. Further deletion analysis revealed insights into the biosynthesis of this unusual and potentially clinically useful lantibiotic, shedding light on mechanisms of regulation and self-resistance. In particular, we report an example of the involvement of a tryptophan halogenase in the modification of a ribosomally synthesized peptide and the pathway-specific regulation of an antibiotic biosynthetic gene cluster by an extracytoplasmic function sigma factor-anti-sigma factor complex.	1
Title: Ligand-binding properties and conformational dynamics of autolysin repeat domains in staphylococcal cell wall recognition Abstract: The bifunctional major autolysin Atl plays a key role in staphylococcal cell separation. Processing of Atl yields catalytically active amidase (AM) and glucosaminidase (GL) domains that are each fused to repeating units. The two repeats of AM (R1 and R2) target the enzyme to the septum, where it cleaves murein between dividing cells. We have determined the crystal structure of R2, which reveals that each repeat folds into two half-open β-barrel subunits. We further demonstrate that lipoteichoic acid serves as a receptor for the repeats and that this interaction depends on conserved surfaces in each subunit. Small-angle X-ray scattering of the mature amidase reveals the presence of flexible linkers separating the AM, R1, and R2 units. Different levels of flexibility for each linker provide mechanistic insights into the conformational dynamics of the full-length protein and the roles of its components in cell wall association and catalysis. Our analysis supports a model in which the repeats direct the catalytic AM domain to the septum, where it can optimally perform the final step of cell division.	0
Title: Cycloheximide and actiphenol production in Streptomyces sp. YIM56141 governed by single biosynthetic machinery featuring an acyltransferase-less type I polyketide synthase Abstract: Cycloheximide (1) and actiphenol (2) have been isolated from numerous Streptomyces species. Cloning, sequencing, and characterization of a gene cluster from Streptomyces sp. YIM65141 now establish that 1 and 2 production is governed by single biosynthetic machinery. Biosynthesis of 1 features an acyltransferase-less type I polyketide synthase to construct its carbon backbone but may proceed via 2 as a key intermediate, invoking a provocative reduction of a phenol to a cyclohexanone moiety in natural product biosynthesis.	1
Title: Morganella Phage Mecenats66 Utilizes an Evolutionarily Distinct Subtype of Headful Genome Packaging with a Preferred Packaging Initiation Site Abstract: Both recognized species from the genus Morganella (M. morganii and M. psychrotolerans) are Gram-negative facultative anaerobic rod-shaped bacteria that have been documented as sometimes being implicated in human disease. Complete genomes of seven Morganella-infecting phages are publicly available today. Here, we report on the genomic characterization of an insect associated Morganella sp. phage, which we named Mecenats66, isolated from dead worker honeybees. Phage Mecenats66 was propagated, purified, and subjected to whole-genome sequencing with subsequent complete genome annotation. After the genome de novo assembly, it was noted that Mecenats66 might employ a headful packaging with a preferred packaging initiation site, although its terminase amino acid sequence did not fall within any of the currently recognized headful packaging subtype employing phage (that had their packaging strategy experimentally verified) with clusters on a terminase sequence phylogenetic tree. The in silico predicted packaging strategy was verified experimentally, validating the packaging initiation site and suggesting that Mecenats66 represents an evolutionarily distinct headful genome packaging with a preferred packaging initiation site strategy subtype. These findings can possibly be attributed to several of the phages already found within the public biological sequence repositories and could aid newly isolated phage packaging strategy predictions in the future.	0
Title: Isolation, Biosynthesis and Chemical Modifications of Rubterolones A-F: Rare Tropolone Alkaloids from Actinomadura sp. 5-2 Abstract: The discovery of six new, highly substituted tropolone alkaloids, rubterolones A-F, from Actinomadura sp. 5-2, isolated from the gut of the fungus-growing termite Macrotermes natalensis is reported. Rubterolones were identified by using fungus-bacteria challenge assays and a HRMS-based dereplication strategy, and characterised by NMR and HRMS analyses and by X-ray crystallography. Feeding experiments and subsequent chemical derivatisation led to a first library of rubterolone derivatives (A-L). Genome sequencing and comparative analyses revealed their putative biosynthetic pathway, which was supported by feeding experiments. This study highlights how gut microbes can present a prolific source of secondary metabolites.	1
Title: Products of RNA polymerases in HeLa cell nuclei Abstract: RNA polymerase activities in intact HeLa cell nuclei have been examined and compared to activities investigated in previous studies of the purified enzymes. The RNA synthesized by the mammalian polymerases while still in nuclei is identified. The polymerases are tentatively identified by location, sensitivity to alpha-amanitin, and response to manganese and altered ionic strength. Polymerase I is located in the nucleolus and labels partially complete precursor molecules of ribosomal RNA. Polymerases II and III are in the nucleoplasm and both label giant nuclear heterogeneous RNA.	0
Title: Elucidation of a carotenoid biosynthesis gene cluster encoding a novel enzyme, 2,2'-beta-hydroxylase, from Brevundimonas sp. strain SD212 and combinatorial biosynthesis of new or rare xanthophylls Abstract: A carotenoid biosynthesis gene cluster mediating the production of 2-hydroxyastaxanthin was isolated from the marine bacterium Brevundimonas sp. strain SD212 by using a common crtI sequence as the probe DNA. A sequence analysis revealed this cluster to contain 12 open reading frames (ORFs), including the 7 known genes, crtW, crtY, crtI, crtB, crtE, idi, and crtZ. The individual ORFs were functionally analyzed by complementation studies using Escherichia coli that accumulated various carotenoid precursors due to the presence of other bacterial crt genes. In addition to functionally identifying the known crt genes, we found that one (ORF11, named crtG) coded for a novel enzyme, carotenoid 2,2'-beta-hydroxylase, which showed intriguingly partial homology with animal sterol-C5-desaturase. When this crtG gene was introduced into E. coli accumulating zeaxanthin and canthaxanthin, the resulting transformants produced their 2-hydroxylated and 2,2'-dihydroxylated products which were structurally novel or rare xanthophylls, as determined by their nuclear magnetic resonance and high-performance liquid chromatography/photodiode array detector/atmospheric pressure chemical ionization mass spectrometry spectral data. The new carotenoid produced was suggested to have a strong inhibitory effect on lipid peroxidation.	1
Title: Division cycle of Myxococcus xanthus. 3. Kinetics of cell growth and protein synthesis Abstract: The kinetics of cell growth and protein synthesis during the division cycle of Myxococcus xanthus was determined. The distribution of cell size for both septated and nonseptated bacteria was obtained by direct measurement of the lengths of 8,000 cells. The Collins-Richmond equation was modified to consider bacterial growth in two phases: growth and division. From the derived equation, the growth rate of individual cells was computed as a function of size. Nondividing cells (growth phase) comprised 91% of the population and took up 87% of the time of the division cycle. The absolute and specific growth rates of nondividing cells were observed to increase continually throughout the growth phase; the growth rate of dividing cells could not be determined accurately by this technique because of changes in the geometry of cells between the time of septation and physical separation. The rate of protein synthesis during the division cycle was measured by pulselabeling an exponential-phase culture with radio-active valine or arginine and then preparing the cells for quantitative autoradiography. By measuring the size of individual cells as well as the number of grains, the rate of protein synthesis as a function of cell size was obtained. Nondividing cells showed an increase in both the absolute and specific rates of protein synthesis throughout the growth phase; the specific rate of protein synthesis for dividing cells was low when compared to growthphase cells. Cell growth and protein synthesis are compared to the previously reported kinetics of deoxyribonucleic acid and ribonucleic acid synthesis during the division cycle.	0
Title: Enantioselective CuH-Catalyzed Hydroacylation Employing Unsaturated Carboxylic Acids as Aldehyde Surrogates Abstract: The direct asymmetric copper hydride (CuH)-catalyzed coupling of α,β-unsaturated carboxylic acids to aryl alkenes to access chiral α-aryl dialkyl ketones is reported. A variety of substrate substitution patterns, sensitive functional groups, and heterocycles are tolerated in this reaction, which significantly expands the range of accessible products compared with existing hydroacylation methodology. Although mechanistic studies are ongoing, we propose that CuH-catalyzed silylation of unsaturated acids occurs to access a uniquely effective acyl electrophilic coupling partner.	0
Title: Evolutionary Trajectories for the Functional Diversification of Anthracycline Methyltransferases Abstract: Microbial natural products are an important source of chemical entities for drug discovery. Recent advances in understanding the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites has revealed how this rich chemical diversity is generated through functional differentiation of biosynthetic enzymes. For instance, investigations into anthracycline anticancer agents have uncovered distinct S-adenosyl methionine (SAM)-dependent proteins: DnrK is a 4-O-methyltransferase involved in daunorubicin biosynthesis, whereas RdmB (52% sequence identity) from the rhodomycin pathway catalyzes 10-hydroxylation. Here, we have mined unknown anthracycline gene clusters and discovered a third protein subclass catalyzing 10-decarboxylation. Subsequent isolation of komodoquinone B from two Streptomyces strains verified the biological relevance of the decarboxylation activity. Phylogenetic analysis inferred two independent routes for the conversion of methyltransferases into hydroxylases, with a two-step process involving loss-of-methylation and gain-of-hydroxylation presented here. Finally, we show that simultaneously with the functional differentiation, the evolutionary process has led to alterations in substrate specificities.	1
Title: Emerimicins V-X, 15-Residue Peptaibols Discovered from an Acremonium sp. through Integrated Genomic and Chemical Approaches Abstract: Fermentation of Acremonium tubakii W. Gams isolated from a soil sample collected from the University of Utah led to the isolation and characterization of six new linear pentadecapeptides, emerimicins V-X (1-6). Peptaibols containing 15-residues are quite rare, with only 22 reported. Genome mining and bioinformatic analysis were used to identify the emerimicin 60 kbp eme biosynthetic cluster harboring a single 16-module hybrid polyketide-nonribosomal peptide synthetase. A detailed bioinformatic investigation of the corresponding 15 adenylation domains, combined with 1D and 2D NMR experiments, LC-MS/MS data, and advanced Marfey's method, allowed for the elucidation and absolute configuration of all proteinogenic and nonproteinogenic amino acid residues in 1-6. As some peptaibols possess cytotoxic activity, a zebrafish embryotoxicity assay was used to evaluate the toxicity of the six emerimicins and showed that emerimicin V (1) and VI (2) exhibit the most potent activity. Additionally, out of the six emerimicins, 1 displayed modest activity against Enterococcus faecalis, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium with MIC values of 64, 32, and 64 μg/mL, respectively.	1
Title: An antibody with a variable-region coiled-coil "knob" domain Abstract: The X-ray crystal structure of a bovine antibody (BLV1H12) revealed a unique structure in its ultralong heavy chain complementarity determining region 3 (CDR3H) that folds into a solvent-exposed β-strand "stalk" fused to a disulfide crosslinked "knob" domain. We have substituted an antiparallel heterodimeric coiled-coil motif for the β-strand stalk in this antibody. The resulting antibody (Ab-coil) expresses in mammalian cells and has a stability similar to that of the parent bovine antibody. MS analysis of H-D exchange supports the coiled-coil structure of the substituted peptides. Substitution of the knob-domain of Ab-coil with bovine granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (bGCSF) results in a stably expressed chimeric antibody, which proliferates mouse NFS-60 cells with a potency comparable to that of bGCSF. This work demonstrates the utility of this novel coiled-coil CDR3 motif as a means for generating stable, potent antibody fusion proteins with useful pharmacological properties.	0
Title: Restriction mapping and hybridization studies of a beta-lactamase-encoding fragment from Streptococcus (Enterococcus) faecalis Abstract: A restriction map of a 5.1-kilobase EcoRI fragment encoding an enterococcal beta-lactamase was prepared and compared with the restriction map of a cloned staphylococcal beta-lactamase gene and with the published maps of several other staphylococcal beta-lactamase genes. Comparison and hybridization studies showed that there were identical restriction sites in the region of the bla structural gene but not in the region surrounding this gene.	0
Title: Isolation and characterization of large treponemes from the bovine rumen Abstract: Ten strains of strictly anaerobic spiral organisms were isolated in pure culture from a 10(-7) dilution of bovine rumen contents. Three strains were studied in detail. These strains morphologically resembled previously isolated and described rumen treponemes except the new isolates were larger, 0.7 micrometer wide and 12 to 25 micrometer long. They rapidly fermented pectin and, less readily, L-arabinose, inulin, and sucrose. Acetic and formic acid were the main fermentation products from pectin; small amounts of succinic acid were also formed.	0
Title: Reporters for the analysis of N-glycosylation in Candida albicans Abstract: A large proportion of Candida albicans cell surface proteins are decorated post-translationally by glycosylation. Indeed N-glycosylation is critical for cell wall biogenesis in this major fungal pathogen and for its interactions with host cells. A detailed understanding of N-glycosylation will yield deeper insights into host-pathogen interactions. However, the analysis of N-glycosylation is extremely challenging because of the complexity and heterogeneity of these structures. Therefore, in an attempt to reduce this complexity and facilitate the analysis of N-glycosylation, we have developed new synthetic C. albicans reporters that carry a single N-linked glycosylation site derived from Saccharomyces cerevisiae Suc2. These glycosylation reporters, which carry C.albicans Hex1 or Sap2 signal sequences plus carboxy-terminal FLAG₃ and His₆ tags, were expressed in C.albicans from the ACT1 promoter. The reporter proteins were successfully secreted and hyperglycosylated by C.albicans cells, and their outer chain glycosylation was dependent on Och1 and Pmr1, which are required for N-mannan synthesis, but not on Mnt1 and Mnt2 which are only required for O-mannosylation. These reporters are useful tools for the experimental dissection of N-glycosylation and other related processes in C.albicans, such as secretion.	0
Title: Isolation and structural characterization of capistruin, a lasso peptide predicted from the genome sequence of Burkholderia thailandensis E264 Abstract: Lasso peptides are a structurally unique class of bioactive peptides characterized by a knotted arrangement, where the C-terminus threads through an N-terminal macrolactam ring. Although ribosomally synthesized, only the gene cluster for the best studied lasso peptide MccJ25 from Escherichia coli consisting of the precursor protein McjA and the processing and immunity proteins McjB, McjC, and McjD is known. Through genome mining studies, we have identified homologues of all four proteins in Burkholderia thailandensis E264 and predicted this strain to produce a lasso peptide. Here we report the successful isolation of the predicted peptide, named capistruin. Upon optimization of the fermentation conditions, mass spectrometric and NMR structural studies proved capistruin to adopt a novel lasso fold. Heterologous production of the lasso peptide in Escherichia coli showed that the identified genes are sufficient for the biosynthesis of capistruin, which exhibits antimicrobial activity against closely related Burkholderia and Pseudomonas strains. In general, our rational approach should be widely applicable for the isolation of new lasso peptides to explore their high structural stability and diverse biological activity.	1
Title: Discovery of cationic nonribosomal peptides as Gram-negative antibiotics through global genome mining Abstract: The worldwide prevalence of infections caused by antibiotic-resistant Gram-negative bacteria poses a serious threat to public health due to the limited therapeutic alternatives. Cationic peptides represent a large family of antibiotics and have attracted interest due to their diverse chemical structures and potential for combating drug-resistant Gram-negative pathogens. Here, we analyze 7395 bacterial genomes to investigate their capacity for biosynthesis of cationic nonribosomal peptides with activity against Gram-negative bacteria. Applying this approach, we identify two novel compounds (brevicidine and laterocidine) showing bactericidal activities against antibiotic-resistant Gram-negative pathogens, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and colistin-resistant Escherichia coli, and an apparently low risk of resistance. The two peptides show efficacy against E. coli in a mouse thigh infection model. These findings may contribute to the discovery and development of Gram-negative antibiotics.	1
Title: Genotyping of Mycobacterium tuberculosis clinical isolates in two cities of Turkey: description of a new family of genotypes that is phylogeographically specific for Asia Minor Abstract: Background:                       Population-based bacterial genetics using repeated DNA loci is an efficient approach to study the biodiversity and phylogeographical structure of human pathogens, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the agent of tuberculosis. Indeed large genetic diversity databases are available for this pathogen and are regularly updated. No population-based polymorphism data were yet available for M. tuberculosis in Turkey, at the crossroads of Eurasia.                  Results:                       A total of 245 DNAs from Mycobacterium tuberculosis clinical isolates from tuberculosis patients residing in Turkey (Malatya n = 147 or Ankara n = 98) were genotyped by spoligotyping, a high-throughput genotyping method based on the polymorphism of the Direct Repeat locus. Thirty-three spoligotyping-defined clusters including 206 patients and 39 unique patterns were found. The ST41 cluster, as designated according to the international SpolDB3 database project, represented one fourth and when gathered to three genotypes, ST53, ST50 and ST284, one half of all the isolates. Out of 34 clinical isolates harboring ST41 which were further genotyped by IS6110 and by MIRU-VNTR typing, a typical 2-copy IS6110-RFLP pattern and a "215125113322" MIRU-VNTR pattern were observed among 21 clinical isolates. Further search in various databases confirms the likely Turkish-phylogeographical specificity of this clonal complex.                  Conclusion:                       We described a new phylogeographically-specific clone of M. tuberculosis, designated LAM7-TUR. Further investigations to assess its frequency within all regions of Turkey and its phylogeographical origin and phylogenetic position within the global M. tuberculosis phylogenetic tree will shed new light on its endemicity in Asia Minor.	0
Title: Biosynthesis of Long-Chain N-Acyl Amide by a Truncated Polyketide Synthase-Nonribosomal Peptide Synthetase Hybrid Megasynthase in Fungi Abstract: Truncated iterative polyketide synthase-nonribosomal peptide synthetase (PKS-NRPS) megasynthases in which only the C domain is present are widespread in fungi, yet nearly all members have unknown functions. Bioinformatics analysis showed that the C domains of such PKS-C enzymes are noncanonical due to substitution at the second histidine in the active site HHxxxDG motif. Here, we used genome mining strategy to characterize a cryptic PKS-C hybrid from Talaromyces wortmanii and discovered the products are reduced long-chain polyketides amidated with a specific ω-amino acid 5-aminopentanoic acid (5PA). The wortmanamides resemble long-chain N-acyl-amide signaling lipids that target diverse receptors including GPCRs. The noncanonical C domain of this PKS-C hybrid was also demonstrated to be a bona fide condensation domain that specifically selects 5PA and catalyzes amidation to release polyketide chain.	1
Title: Molecular characterization of the enniatin synthetase gene encoding a multifunctional enzyme catalysing N-methyldepsipeptide formation in Fusarium scirpi Abstract: The gene encoding the multifunctional enzyme enniatin synthetase from Fusarium scirpi (esyn1) was isolated and characterized by transcriptional mapping and expression studies in Escherichia coli. This is the first example of a gene encoding an N-methyl peptide synthetase. The nucleotide sequence revealed an open reading frame of 9393 bp encoding a protein of 3131 amino acids (M(r) 346,900). Two domains designated EA and EB within the protein were identified which share similarity to each other and to microbial peptide synthetase domains. In contrast to the N-terminal domain EA, the carboxyl terminal domain EB is interrupted by a 434-amino-acid portion which shows local similarity to a motif apparently conserved within adenine and cytosine RNA and DNA methyltransferases and therefore seems to harbour the N-methyl-transferase function of the multienzyme.	1
Title: Identification of a unique Ca2+-binding site in rat acid-sensing ion channel 3 Abstract: Acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) evolved to sense changes in extracellular acidity with the divalent cation calcium (Ca2+) as an allosteric modulator and channel blocker. The channel-blocking activity is most apparent in ASIC3, as removing Ca2+ results in channel opening, with the site's location remaining unresolved. Here we show that a ring of rat ASIC3 (rASIC3) glutamates (Glu435), located above the channel gate, modulates proton sensitivity and contributes to the formation of the elusive Ca2+ block site. Mutation of this residue to glycine, the equivalent residue in chicken ASIC1, diminished the rASIC3 Ca2+ block effect. Atomistic molecular dynamic simulations corroborate the involvement of this acidic residue in forming a high-affinity Ca2+ site atop the channel pore. Furthermore, the reported observations provide clarity for past controversies regarding ASIC channel gating. Our findings enhance understanding of ASIC gating mechanisms and provide structural and energetic insights into this unique calcium-binding site.	0
Title: A gene cluster from Streptomyces galilaeus involved in glycosylation of aclarubicin Abstract: We have cloned and characterized a gene cluster for anthracycline biosynthesis from Streptomyces galilaeus. This cluster, 15-kb long, includes eight genes involved in the deoxyhexose biosynthesis pathway, a gene for a glycosyltransferase and one for an activator, as well as two genes involved in aglycone biosynthesis. Gene disruption targeted to the activator gene blocked production of aclacinomycins in S. galilaeus. Plasmid pSgs4, containing genes for a glycosyltransferase (aknS), an aminomethylase (aknX), a glucose-1-phosphate thymidylyltransferase (akn Y) and two genes for unidentified glycosylation functions (aknT and aknV), restored the production of aclacinomycins in the S. galilaeus mutants H063, which accumulates aklavinone, and H054, which produces aklavinone with rhodinose and deoxyfucose residues. Furthermore, pSgs4 directed the production of L-rhamnosyl-epsilon-rhodomycinone and L-daunosaminyl-epsilon-rhodomycinone in S. peucetius strains that produce epsilon-rhodomycinone endogenously. Subcloning of the gene cluster was carried out in order to further define the genes that are responsible for complementation and hybrid anthracycline generation.	1
Title: Investigation of the physiological relationship between the cyanide-insensitive oxidase and cyanide production in Pseudomonas aeruginosa Abstract: Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen which demonstrates considerable respiratory versatility, possessing up to five terminal oxidases. One oxidase, the cyanide-insensitive oxidase (CIO), has been previously shown to be resistant to the potent respiratory inhibitor cyanide, a toxin that is synthesized by this bacterium. This study investigated the physiological relationship between hydrogen cyanide production and the CIO. It was found that cyanide is produced in P. aeruginosa at similar levels irrespective of its complement of CIO, indicating that the CIO is not an obligatory electron sink for cyanide synthesis. However, MICs for cyanide and growth in its presence demonstrated that the CIO provides P. aeruginosa with protection against the effects of exogenous cyanide. Nevertheless, the presence of cyanide did not affect the viability of cio mutant strains compared to the wild-type during prolonged incubation in stationary phase. The detection of the fermentation end products acetate and succinate in stationary-phase culture supernatants suggests that P. aeruginosa, irrespective of its CIO complement, may in part rely upon fermentation for energy generation in stationary phase. Furthermore, the decrease in cyanide levels during incubation in sealed flasks suggested that active breakdown of HCN by the culture was taking place. To investigate the possibility that the CIO may play a role in pathogenicity, wild-type and cio mutant strains were tested in the paralytic killing model of Caenorhabditis elegans, a model in which cyanide is the principal toxic agent leading to nematode death. The CIO mutant had delayed killing kinetics, demonstrating that the CIO is required for full pathogenicity of P. aeruginosa in this animal model.	0
Title: Organization of genes required for gellan polysaccharide biosynthesis in Sphingomonas elodea ATCC 31461 Abstract: Sphingomonas elodea ATCC 31461 produces gellan, a capsular polysaccharide that is useful as a gelling agent for food and microbiological media. Complementation of nonmucoid S. elodea mutants with a gene library resulted in identification of genes essential for gellan biosynthesis. A cluster of 18 genes spanning 21 kb was isolated. These 18 genes are homologous to genes for synthesis of sphingan polysaccharide S-88 from Sphingomonas sp. ATCC 31554, with predicted amino acid identities varying from 61% to 98%. Both polysaccharides have the same tetrasaccharide repeat unit, comprised of [-->4)-alpha- l-rhamnose-(1-->3)-beta- d-glucose-(1-->4)-beta- d-glucuronic acid-(1-->4)-beta- d-glucose-(1-->]. Polysaccharide S-88, however, has mannose or rhamnose in the fourth position and has a rhamnosyl side chain, while gellan has no sugar side chain but is modified by glyceryl and acetyl substituents. Genes for synthesis of the precursor dTDP- l-rhamnose were highly conserved. The least conserved genes in this cluster encode putative glycosyl transferases III and IV and a gene of unknown function, gelF. Three genes ( gelI, gelM, and gelN) affected the amount and rheology of gellan produced. Four additional genes present in the S-88 sphingan biosynthetic gene cluster did not have homologs in the gene cluster for gellan biosynthesis. Three of these gene homologs, gelR, gelS, and gelG, were found in an operon unlinked to the main gellan biosynthetic gene cluster. In a third region, a gene possibly involved in positive regulation of gellan biosynthesis was identified.	1
Title: FKS mutations and elevated echinocandin MIC values among Candida glabrata isolates from U.S. population-based surveillance Abstract: Candida glabrata is the second leading cause of candidemia in the United States. Its high-level resistance to triazole antifungal drugs has led to the increased use of the echinocandin class of antifungal agents for primary therapy of these infections. We monitored C. glabrata bloodstream isolates from a population-based surveillance study for elevated echinocandin MIC values (MICs of ≥0.25 μg/ml). From the 490 C. glabrata isolates that were screened, we identified 16 isolates with an elevated MIC value (2.9% of isolates from Atlanta and 2.0% of isolates from Baltimore) for one or more of the echinocandin drugs caspofungin, anidulafungin, and micafungin. All of the isolates with elevated MIC values had a mutation in the previously identified hot spot 1 of either the glucan synthase FKS1 (n = 2) or FKS2 (n = 14) gene. No mutations were detected in hot spot 2 of either FKS1 or FKS2. The predominant mutation was mutation of FKS2-encoded serine 663 to proline (S663P), found in 10 of the isolates with elevated echinocandin MICs. Two of the mutations, R631G for FKS1 and R665G for FKS2, have not been reported previously for C. glabrata. Multilocus sequence typing indicated that the predominance of the S663P mutation was not due to the clonal spread of a single sequence type. With a rising number of echinocandin therapy failures reported, it is important to continue to monitor rates of elevated echinocandin MIC values and the associated mutations.	0
Title: Biosynthesis of Amino Acid Derived α-Pyrones by an NRPS-NRPKS Hybrid Megasynthetase in Fungi Abstract: A nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS)-nonreducing polyketide synthase (NRPKS) hybrid enzyme (AnATPKS) from Aspergillus niger was shown to produce amino acid derived α-pyrone natural products (pyrophen and campyrone B). Biochemical characterization of the NRPS module in vitro reveals that the adenylation domain is promiscuous toward a variety of substituted phenylalanine analogues. Using precursor feeding and heterologous expression of AnATPKS and an associated O-methyltransferase (AnOMT), we were able to access a library of substituted pyrophen analogues. Our study paves the way for future combinatorial biosynthesis of diverse α-pyrone natural products using NRPS-NRPKS hybrids.	1
Title: Enhanced Ammonia Oxidation Catalysis by a Low-Spin Iron Complex Featuring Cis Coordination Sites Abstract: The goal of using ammonia as a solar fuel motivates the development of selective ammonia oxidation (AO) catalysts for fuel cell applications. Herein, we describe Fe-mediated AO electrocatalysis with [(bpyPy2Me)Fe(MeCN)2]2+, exhibiting the highest turnover number (TON) reported to date for a molecular system. To improve on our recent report of a related iron AO electrocatalyst, [(TPA)Fe(MeCN)2]2+ (TON of 16), the present [(bpyPy2Me)Fe(MeCN)2]2+ system (TON of 149) features a stronger-field, more rigid auxiliary ligand that maintains cis-labile sites and a dominant low-spin population at the Fe(II) state. The latter is posited to mitigate demetalation and hence catalyst degradation by the presence of a large excess of ammonia under the catalytic conditions. Additionally, the [(bpyPy2Me)Fe(MeCN)2]2+ system exhibits a substantially faster AO rate (ca. 50×) at significantly lower (∼250 mV) applied bias compared to [(TPA)Fe(MeCN)2]2+. Electrochemical data are consistent with an initial E1 net H-atom abstraction step that furnishes the cis amide/ammine complex [(bpyPy2Me)Fe(NH2)(NH3)]2+, followed by the onset of catalysis at E2. Theoretical calculations suggest the possibility of N-N bond formation via multiple thermodynamically plausible pathways, including both reductive elimination and ammonia nucleophilic attack. In sum, this study underscores that Fe, an earth-abundant metal, is a promising metal for further development in metal-mediated AO catalysis by molecular systems.	0
Title: The sporothriolides. A new biosynthetic family of fungal secondary metabolites Abstract: The biosynthetic gene cluster of the antifungal metabolite sporothriolide 1 was identified from three producing ascomycetes: Hypomontagnella monticulosa MUCL 54604, H. spongiphila CLL 205 and H. submonticulosa DAOMC 242471. A transformation protocol was established, and genes encoding a fatty acid synthase subunit and a citrate synthase were simultaneously knocked out which led to loss of sporothriolide and sporochartine production. In vitro reactions showed that the sporochartines are derived from non-enzymatic Diels-Alder cycloaddition of 1 and trienylfuranol A 7 during the fermentation and extraction process. Heterologous expression of the spo genes in Aspergillus oryzae then led to the production of intermediates and shunts and delineation of a new fungal biosynthetic pathway originating in fatty acid biosynthesis. Finally, a hydrolase was revealed by in vitro studies likely contributing towards self-resistance of the producer organism.	1
Title: Insights into Protein Stability in Cell Lysate by 19 F NMR Spectroscopy Abstract: In living organisms, protein folding and function take place in an inhomogeneous, highly crowded environment possessing a concentration of diverse macromolecules of up to 400 g/L. It has been shown that the intracellular environment has a pronounced effect on the stability, dynamics and function of the protein under study, and has for this reason to be considered. However, most protein studies neglect the presence of these macromolecules. Consequently, we probe here the overall thermodynamic stability of cold shock protein B from Bacillus subtilis (BsCspB) in cell lysate. We found that an increase in cell lysate concentration causes a monotonic increase in the thermodynamic stability of BsCspB. This result strongly underlines the importance of considering the biological environment when inherent protein parameters are quantitatively determined. Moreover, we demonstrate that targeted application of 19 F NMR spectroscopy operates as an ideal tool for protein studies performed in complex cellular surroundings.	0
Title: Novel tryptophan metabolism by a potential gene cluster that is widely distributed among actinomycetes Abstract: The characterization of potential gene clusters is a promising strategy for the identification of novel natural products and the expansion of structural diversity. However, there are often difficulties in identifying potential metabolites because their biosynthetic genes are either silenced or expressed only at a low level. Here, we report the identification of a novel metabolite that is synthesized by a potential gene cluster containing an indole prenyltransferase gene (SCO7467) and a flavin-dependent monooxygenase (FMO) gene (SCO7468), which were mined from the genome of Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2). We introduced these two genes into the closely related Streptomyces lividans TK23 and analyzed the culture broths of the transformants. This process allowed us to identify a novel metabolite, 5-dimethylallylindole-3-acetonitrile (5-DMAIAN) that was overproduced in the transformant. Biochemical characterization of the recombinant SCO7467 and SCO7468 demonstrated the novel L-tryptophan metabolism leading to 5-DMAIAN. SCO7467 catalyzes the prenylation of L-tryptophan to form 5-dimethylallyl-L-tryptophan (5-DMAT). This enzyme is the first actinomycetes prenyltransferase known to catalyze the addition of a dimethylallyl group to the C-5 of tryptophan. SCO7468 then catalyzes the conversion of 5-DMAT into 5-dimethylallylindole-3-acetaldoxime (5-DMAIAOx). An aldoxime-forming reaction catalyzed by the FMO enzyme was also identified for the first time in this study. Finally, dehydration of 5-DMAIAOx presumably occurs to yield 5-DMAIAN. This study provides insight into the biosynthesis of prenylated indoles that have been purified from actinomycetes.	1
Title: A tricyclic pyrrolobenzodiazepine produced by Klebsiella oxytoca is associated with cytotoxicity in antibiotic-associated hemorrhagic colitis Abstract: Cytotoxin-producing Klebsiella oxytoca is the causative agent of antibiotic-associated hemorrhagic colitis (AAHC). Recently, the cytotoxin associated with AAHC was identified as tilivalline, a known pentacyclic pyrrolobenzodiazepine (PBD) metabolite produced by K. oxytoca Although this assertion of tilivalline's role in AAHC is supported by evidence from animal experiments, some key aspects of this finding appear to be incompatible with toxicity mechanisms of known PBD toxins. We therefore hypothesized that K. oxytoca may produce some other uncharacterized cytotoxins. To address this question, we investigated whether tilivalline alone is indeed necessary and sufficient to induce cytotoxicity or whether K. oxytoca also produces other cytotoxins. LC-MS- and NMR-based metabolomic analyses revealed the presence of an abundant tricyclic PBD, provisionally designated kleboxymycin, in the supernatant of toxigenic K. oxytoca strains. Moreover, by generating multiple mutants with gene deletions affecting tilivalline biosynthesis, we show that a tryptophanase-deficient, tilivalline-negative K. oxytoca mutant induced cytotoxicity in vitro similar to tilivalline-positive K. oxytoca strains. Furthermore, synthetic kleboxymycin exhibited greater than 9-fold higher cytotoxicity than tilivalline in TC50 cell culture assays. We also found that the biosynthetic pathways for kleboxymycin and tilivalline appear to overlap, as tilivalline is an indole derivative of kleboxymycin. In summary, our results indicate that tilivalline is not essential for inducing cytotoxicity observed in K. oxytoca-associated AAHC and that kleboxymycin is a tilivalline-related bacterial metabolite with even higher cytotoxicity.	1
Title: Functional cloning and characterization of antibiotic resistance genes from the chicken gut microbiome Abstract: Culture-independent sampling in conjunction with a functional cloning approach identified diverse antibiotic resistance genes for different classes of antibiotics in gut microbiomes from both conventionally raised and free-range chickens. Many of the genes are phylogenetically distant from known resistance genes. Two unique genes that conferred ampicillin and spectinomycin resistance were also functional in Campylobacter, a distant relative of the Escherichia coli host used to generate the genomic libraries.	0
Title: Himalaquinones A-G, Angucyclinone-Derived Metabolites Produced by the Himalayan Isolate Streptomyces sp. PU-MM59 Abstract: Himalaquinones A-G, seven new anthraquinone-derived metabolites, were obtained from the Himalayan-based Streptomyces sp. PU-MM59. The chemical structures of the new compounds were identified based on cumulative analyses of HRESIMS and NMR spectra. Himalaquinones A-F were determined to be unique anthraquinones that contained unusual C-4a 3-methylbut-3-enoic acid aromatic substitutions, while himalaquinone G was identified as a new 5,6-dihydrodiol-bearing angucyclinone. Comparative bioactivity assessment (antimicrobial, cancer cell line cytotoxicity, impact on 4E-BP1 phosphorylation, and effect on axolotl embryo tail regeneration) revealed cytotoxic landomycin and saquayamycin analogues to inhibit 4E-BP1p and inhibit regeneration. In contrast, himalaquinone G, while also cytotoxic and a regeneration inhibitor, did not affect 4E-BP1p status at the doses tested. As such, this work implicates a unique mechanism for himalaquinone G and possibly other 5,6-dihydrodiol-bearing angucyclinones.	0
Title: Identification of 6-Hydroxymellein Synthase and Accessory Genes in the Lichen Cladonia uncialis Abstract: A transcribed polyketide synthase (PKS) gene has been identified in the lichen Cladonia uncialis. The complete nucleotide sequence of this PKS was determined from the amplified cDNA, and an assignment of individual domains was accomplished by homology searching using AntiSMASH. A scan of the complete genome sequence of C. uncialis revealed the accessory genes associated with this PKS gene. A homology search has identified that several genes in this cluster are similar to genes responsible for the biosynthesis of terrein in Aspergillus terreus. This permitted assignment of putative function to each of the genes in this new C. uncialis cluster. It is proposed that this gene cluster is responsible for the biosynthesis of a halogenated iscoumarin. This is the first report linking a gene cluster to a halogenated metabolite in lichen.	1
Title: Rational generation of lasso peptides based on biosynthetic gene mutations and site-selective chemical modifications Abstract: Lasso peptides are a unique family of natural products whose structures feature a specific threaded fold, which confers these peptides the resistance to thermal and proteolytic degradation. This stability gives lasso peptides excellent pharmacokinetic properties, which together with their diverse reported bioactivities have garnered extensive attention because of their drug development potential. Notably, the threaded fold has proven quite inaccessible by chemical synthesis, which has hindered efficient generation of structurally diverse lasso peptides. We herein report the discovery of a new lasso peptide stlassin (1) by gene activation based on a Streptomyces heterologous expression system. Site-directed mutagenesis on the precursor peptide-encoding gene is carried out systematically, generating 17 stlassin derivatives (2-17 and 21) with residue-replacements at specific positions of 1. The solution NMR structures of 1, 3, 4, 14 and 16 are determined, supporting structural comparisons that ultimately enabled the rational production of disulfide bond-containing derivatives 18 and 19, whose structures do not belong to any of the four classes currently used to classify lasso peptides. Several site-selective chemical modifications are first applied on 16 and 21, efficiently generating new derivatives (20, 22-27) whose structures bear various decorations beyond the peptidyl monotonicity. The high production yields of these stlassin derivatives facilitate biological assays, which show that 1, 4, 16, 20, 21 and 24 possess antagonistic activities against the binding of lipopolysaccharides to toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). These results demonstrate proof-of-concept for the combined mutational/chemical generation of lasso peptide libraries to support drug lead development.	1
Title: Targeting Base Excision Repair Glycosylases with DNA Containing Transition State Mimics Prepared via Click Chemistry Abstract: DNA glycosylases of the base excision repair (BER) pathway are front-line defenders in removing compromising modifications of the DNA nucleobases. Aberrantly modified nucleobases mediate genomic mutations and inhibit DNA replication leading to adverse health consequences such as cancer, neurological diseases, and aging. In an effort to develop high-affinity transition state (TS) analogues as chemical biology probes for DNA glycosylases, oligonucleotides containing a propargyl-modified pyrrolidine TS mimic nucleotide were synthesized. A small library of TS mimic-containing oligonucleotides was generated using a structurally diverse set of five azides via copper(I)-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition "click" chemistry. The relative affinity ( Kd) was evaluated for BER glycosylases Escherichia coli MutY, bacterial formamidopyrimidine glycosylase (Fpg), and human OG glycosylase 1 (hOGG1) with the library of TS mimic DNA duplexes. All of the BER glycosylases were found to exhibit extremely high affinities (approximately picomolar Kd values) for the TS mimics. However, binding preferences, distinct for each glycosylase, for the TS mimic library members were observed, suggesting different modes of binding and transition state stabilization among the three glycosylases. Fpg bound all of the TS mimics with exceptionally high affinities, while the MutY binding affinity correlated inversely with the size of the appended moiety. Of note, we identified one member of the small TS mimic library that exhibited a particularly high affinity for hOGG1. These results strongly support the use of the propargyl-TS mimic oligonucleotides and elaboration via click chemistry in screening and identification of high-affinity ligands for BER glycosylases of interest.	0
Title: Tracking brain palmitoylation change: predominance of glial change in a mouse model of Huntington's disease Abstract: Protein palmitoylation, a reversible lipid modification of proteins, is widely used in the nervous system, with dysregulated palmitoylation being implicated in a variety of neurological disorders. Described below is ABE/SILAM, a proteomic strategy that couples acyl-biotinyl exchange (ABE) purification of palmitoyl-proteins to whole animal stable isotope labeling (SILAM) to provide an accurate tracking of palmitoylation change within rodent disease models. As a first application, we have used ABE/SILAM to look at Huntington's disease (HD), profiling palmitoylation change in two HD-relevant mouse mutants: the transgenic HD model mouse YAC128 and the hypomorphic Hip14-gt mouse, which has sharply reduced expression for HIP14 (Zdhhc17), a palmitoyl-transferase implicated in the HD disease process. Rather than mapping to the degenerating neurons themselves, the biggest disease changes instead map to astrocytes and oligodendrocytes (i.e., the supporting glial cells).	0
Title: Identification and characterization of leucocyclicin Q, a novel cyclic bacteriocin produced by Leuconostoc mesenteroides TK41401 Abstract: The culture supernatant of Leuconostoc mesenteroides TK41401, isolated from Japanese pickles, possessed antimicrobial activity against broad range of a bacterial genera and particularly strong activity against Bacillus coagulans, the major contaminant of pickles. An antimicrobial peptide was purified in three chromatographic steps, and its molecular mass was determined to be 6,115.59 Da by electrospray ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (ESI-TOF MS). The primary structure of this peptide was determined by amino acid and DNA sequencing, and these analyses revealed that it was translated as a 63-residue precursor. This precursor showed high similarity to the precursor of lactocyclicin Q, a cyclic bacteriocin produced by Lactococcus sp. strain QU 12. The molecular weight calculated after cyclization, which was presumed to involve the same process as in lactocyclicin Q (between L3 and W63), agreed with that estimated by ESI-TOF MS. This peptide was proved to be a novel cyclic bacteriocin, and it was termed leucocyclicin Q. The antimicrobial spectrum of this bacteriocin clearly differed from that of lactocyclicin Q, even though their primary structures were quite similar. This is the first report of a cyclic bacteriocin produced by a strain of the genus Leuconostoc.	1
Title: Biosynthesis of the unusual 5,5-gem-dimethyl-deoxysugar noviose: investigation of the C-methyltransferase gene cloU Abstract: The aminocoumarin antibiotic clorobiocin contains an unusual branched deoxysugar with a 5,5-gem-dimethyl structure. Inactivation of the putative C-methyltransferase gene cloU was carried out, which led to the loss of the axial methyl group at C-5 of this deoxysugar moiety. This result establishes the function of cloU, and at the same time it proves that the biosynthesis of the deoxysugar moiety of clorobiocin proceeds via a 3,5-epimerization of the dTDP-4-keto-6-deoxyglucose intermediate. The inactivation was carried out on a cosmid which contained the entire clorobiocin biosynthetic gene cluster. Expression of the modified cluster in a heterologous host led to the formation of desmethyl-clorobiocin and a structural isomer thereof. Both compounds were isolated on a preparative scale, their structures were elucidated by 1H-NMR and mass spectroscopy and their antibacterial activity was assayed.	1
Title: Unique features of the ketosynthase domain in a nonribosomal peptide synthetase-polyketide synthase hybrid enzyme, tenuazonic acid synthetase 1 Abstract: Many microbial secondary metabolites are produced by multienzyme complexes comprising nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) and polyketide synthases (PKSs). The ketosynthase (KS) domains of polyketide synthase normally catalyze the decarboxylative Claisen condensation of acyl and malonyl blocks to extend the polyketide chain. However, the terminal KS domain in tenuazonic acid synthetase 1 (TAS1) from the fungus Pyricularia oryzae conducts substrate cyclization. Here, we report on the unique features of the KS domain in TAS1. We observed that this domain is monomeric, not dimeric as is typical for KSs. Analysis of a 1.68-Å resolution crystal structure suggests that the substrate cyclization is triggered via proton abstraction from the active methylene moiety in the substrate by a catalytic His-322 residue. Additionally, we show that TAS1 KS promiscuously accepts aminoacyl substrates and that this promiscuity can be increased by a single amino acid substitution in the substrate-binding pocket of the enzyme. These findings provide insight into a KS domain that accepts the amino acid-containing substrate in an NRPS-PKS hybrid enzyme and provide hints to the substrate cyclization mechanism performed by the KS domain in the biosynthesis of the mycotoxin tenuazonic acid.	1
Title: Damage detection and base flipping in direct DNA alkylation repair Abstract: THE FOREIGN LESION: The mechanistic questions for DNA base damage detection by repair proteins are discussed in this Minireview. Repair proteins could either probe and locate a weakened base pair that results from base damage, or passively capture an extrahelical base lesion in the first step of damage searching on double-stranded DNA. How some repair proteins, such as AGT (see figure), locate base lesions in DNA is still not fully understood.To remove a few damaged bases efficiently from the context of the entire genome, the DNA base repair proteins rely on remarkably specific detection mechanisms to locate base lesions. This efficient molecular recognition event inside cells has been extensively studied with various structural and biochemical tools. These studies suggest that DNA base damage can be located by repair proteins by using two mechanisms: a repair protein can probe and detect a weakened base pair that results from mutagenic or cytotoxic base damage; alternatively, a protein can passively capture and stabilize an extrahelical base lesion. Our chemical and structural studies on the direct DNA repair proteins hAGT, C-Ada and ABH2 suggest that these proteins search for weakened base pairs in their first step of damage searching. We have also discovered a very unique base-flipping mechanism used by the DNA repair protein AlkB. This protein distorts DNA and favors single stranded DNA (ssDNA) substrates over double-stranded (dsDNA) ones. Potentially, it locates base lesions in dsDNA by imposing a constraint that targets less rigid regions of the duplex DNA. The exact mechanism of how AlkB and related proteins search for damage in ssDNA and dsDNA still awaits further studies.	0
Title: Virulence factors and molecular characteristics of Shigella flexneri isolated from calves with diarrhea Abstract: Background:                       The natural hosts of Shigella are typically humans and other primates, but it has been shown that the host range of Shigella has expanded to many animals. Although Shigella is becoming a major threat to animals, there is limited information on the genetic background of local strains. The purpose of this study was to assess the presence of virulence factors and the molecular characteristics of S. flexneri isolated from calves with diarrhea.                  Results:                       Fifty-four S. flexneri isolates from Gansun, Shanxi, Qinghai, Xinjiang and Tibet obtained during 2014 to 2016 possessed four typical biochemical characteristics of Shigella. The prevalences of ipaH, virA, ipaBCD, ial, sen, set1A, set1B and stx were 100 %, 100 %, 77.78 %, 79.63 %, 48.15 %, 48.15 and 0 %, respectively. Multilocus variable number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA) based on 8 variable number of tandem repeat (VNTR) loci discriminated the isolates into 39 different MLVA types (MTs), pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) based on NotI digestion divided the 54 isolates into 31 PFGE types (PTs), and multilocus sequence typing (MLST) based on 15 housekeeping genes differentiated the isolates into 7 MLST sequence types (STs).                  Conclusions:                       The findings from this study enrich our knowledge of the molecular characteristics of S. flexneri collected from calves with diarrhea, which will be important for addressing clinical and epidemiological issues regarding shigellosis.	0
Title: Characterization of the interaction of the marine cyanobacterial natural product curacin A with the colchicine site of tubulin and initial structure-activity studies with analogues Abstract: Curacin A, the major lipid constituent of a strain of the marine cyanobacterium Lyngbya majuscula obtained off the coast of Curaçao, is a potent antimitotic agent that we have previously shown to inhibit microtubule assembly and colchicine binding to tubulin. In the present study, we report that curacin A probably binds in the colchicine site because it competitively inhibits the binding of [3H]colchicine to tubulin with an apparent Ki value of 0.6 microM and stimulates tubulin-dependent GTP hydrolysis, as do most other colchicine-site agents. The binding of curacin A to tubulin resembled the binding reactions of combretastatin A-4 and podophyllotoxin in contrast to that of colchicine in that it occurred as extensively on ice as at higher temperatures. However, once bound, the dissociation rate of curacin A from tubulin is very slow, more closely resembling that observed with colchicinoids (thiocolchicine was the drug examined) than the faster dissociation that occurs with combretastatin A-4 and podophyllotoxin. Because the molecular structure of curacin A is so different from that of previously described colchicine-site drugs (e.g., there is no aromatic moiety, and there are only two conjugated double bonds in its linear hydrocarbon chain), we have been examining the activities of natural isomers and synthetic derivatives. So far, only modest enhancement or reduction of activity has been observed with a variety of structural changes.	1
Title: RNA architecture dictates the conformations of a bound peptide Abstract: Background:                       The biological function of several viral and bacteriophage proteins, and their arginine-rich subdomains, involves RNA-mediated interactions. It has been shown recently that bound peptides adopt either beta-hairpin or alpha-helical conformations in viral and phage peptide-RNA complexes. We have compared the structures of the arginine-rich peptide domain of HIV-1 Rev bound to two RNA aptamers to determine whether RNA architecture can dictate the conformations of a bound peptide.                  Results:                       The core-binding segment of the HIV-1 Rev peptide class II RNA aptamer complex spans the two-base bulge and hairpin loop of the bound RNA and the carboxy-terminal segment of the bound peptide. The bound peptide is anchored in place by backbone and sidechain intermolecular hydrogen bonding and van der Waals stacking interactions. One of the bulge bases participates in U*(A*U) base triple formation, whereas the other is looped out and flaps over the bound peptide in the complex. The seven-residue hairpin loop is closed by a sheared G*A mismatch pair with several pyrimidines looped out of the hairpin fold.                  Conclusions:                       Our structural studies establish that RNA architecture dictates whether the same HIV-1 Rev peptide folds into an extended or alpha-helical conformation on complex formation. Arginine-rich peptides can therefore adapt distinct secondary folds to complement the tertiary folds of their RNA targets. This contrasts with protein-RNA complexes in which elements of RNA secondary structure adapt to fit within the tertiary folds of their protein targets.	0
Title: Genome sequence of the streptomycin-producing microorganism Streptomyces griseus IFO 13350 Abstract: We determined the complete genome sequence of Streptomyces griseus IFO 13350, a soil bacterium producing an antituberculosis agent, streptomycin, which is the first aminoglycoside antibiotic, discovered more than 60 years ago. The linear chromosome consists of 8,545,929 base pairs (bp), with an average G+C content of 72.2%, predicting 7,138 open reading frames, six rRNA operons (16S-23S-5S), and 66 tRNA genes. It contains extremely long terminal inverted repeats (TIRs) of 132,910 bp each. The telomere's nucleotide sequence and secondary structure, consisting of several palindromes with a loop sequence of 5'-GGA-3', are different from those of typical telomeres conserved among other Streptomyces species. In accordance with the difference, the chromosome has pseudogenes for a conserved terminal protein (Tpg) and a telomere-associated protein (Tap), and a novel pair of Tpg and Tap proteins is instead encoded by the TIRs. Comparisons with the genomes of two related species, Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) and Streptomyces avermitilis, clarified not only the characteristics of the S. griseus genome but also the existence of 24 Streptomyces-specific proteins. The S. griseus genome contains 34 gene clusters or genes for the biosynthesis of known or unknown secondary metabolites. Transcriptome analysis using a DNA microarray showed that at least four of these clusters, in addition to the streptomycin biosynthesis gene cluster, were activated directly or indirectly by AdpA, which is a central transcriptional activator for secondary metabolism and morphogenesis in the A-factor (a gamma-butyrolactone signaling molecule) regulatory cascade in S. griseus.	1
Title: Phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate synthetase, as a suppressor of the sepH mutation in Aspergillus nidulans, is required for the proper timing of septation Abstract: Timely cytokinesis/septation is essential for hyphal growth and conidiation in Aspergillus nidulans. Genetic analyses have identified that A. nidulans has components of the septum initiation network (SIN) pathway; one of these, SEPH, is a key player for early events during cytokinesis. However, little is known about how the SEPH kinase cascade is regulated by other components. Here, we demonstrate that the phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate synthetase family acts antagonistically against the SIN so that the downregulation of AnPRS family can bypass the requirements of the SIN for septum formation and conidiation. The transcription defect of the Anprs gene family accompanied with the reduction of AnPRS activity causes the formation of hyper-septation as well as the restoration of septation and conidiation in the absence of SEPH. Clearly, the timing and positioning of septation is related to AnPRS activity. Moreover, with the extensive yeast two-hybrid analysis and rescue combination experiments, it demonstrated that AnPRS members are able to form the heterodimers for functional interacting entities but they appear to contribute so unequally that Anprs1 mutant display relatively normal septation, but Anprs2 deletion is lethal. Thus, compared to in yeast, the AnPRS family may have a unique regulation mechanism during septation in filamentous fungi.	0
Title: Mutations affecting transcription pausing in the Bacillus subtilis pyr operon Abstract: Pausing during transcription of the Bacillus subtilis pyr operon was proposed to play a role in its regulation by attenuation. Substitution mutations in the B. subtilis pyr DNA specifying the 3'-terminal nucleotides of the previously identified transcription pause sites substantially reduced pausing at these sites in vitro. This result confirms the general utility of this mutagenic strategy for studying transcriptional pausing. Pyrimidine-mediated repression in vivo of pyr-lacZ fusions containing some of these substitution mutations was substantially lower than those observed with the wild-type pyr-lacZ fusions. However, these defects in regulation were correlated with alterations in the stability of the terminator stem-loop specified by the attenuator, rather than with their effects on transcriptional pausing in vitro.	0
Title: Identification, Characterization, and Synthesis of Natural Parasitic Cysteine Protease Inhibitors: Pentacitidins Are More Potent Falcitidin Analogues Abstract: Protease inhibitors represent a promising therapeutic option for the treatment of parasitic diseases such as malaria and human African trypanosomiasis. Falcitidin was the first member of a new class of inhibitors of falcipain-2, a cysteine protease of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum. Using a metabolomics dataset of 25 Chitinophaga strains for molecular networking enabled identification of over 30 natural analogues of falcitidin. Based on MS/MS spectra, they vary in their amino acid chain length, sequence, acyl residue, and C-terminal functionalization; therefore, they were grouped into the four falcitidin peptide families A-D. The isolation, characterization, and absolute structure elucidation of two falcitidin-related pentapeptide aldehyde analogues by extensive MS/MS spectrometry and NMR spectroscopy in combination with advanced Marfey's analysis was in agreement with the in silico analysis of the corresponding biosynthetic gene cluster. Total synthesis of chosen pentapeptide analogues followed by in vitro testing against a panel of proteases revealed selective parasitic cysteine protease inhibition and, additionally, low-micromolar inhibition of α-chymotrypsin. The pentapeptides investigated here showed superior inhibitory activity compared to falcitidin.	1
Title: Purification and characterization of S-adenosylhomocysteine deaminase from streptonigrin-producing Streptomyces flocculus Abstract: An S-adenosylhomocysteine deaminase has been isolated and purified from streptonigrin-producing Streptomyces flocculus ATCC 13257. Deamination represents the major metabolic route of S-adenosylhomocysteine in this organism. The protein was found to be monomeric with a molecular weight of 56,100 +/- 1,600. The activity was optimal at pH 7.0 and 37 degrees C, and the deaminase was inactivated by p-chloromercuribenzoate but not by metal chelators. The Km for S-adenosylhomocysteine is 2.5 mM, and the Ki for inhibition by deoxycoformycin is 1.6 nM.	0
Title: Two transcription factors cooperatively regulate DHN melanin biosynthesis and development in Pestalotiopsis fici Abstract: Fungal 1,8-dihydroxynaphthalene (DHN) melanin plays important roles in UV protection, oxidative stress and pathogenesis. However, knowledge of the regulatory mechanisms of its biosynthesis is limited. Previous studies showed two transcription factors, PfmaF and PfmaH, located in the DHN melanin biosynthetic gene cluster (Pfma) in Pestalotiopsis fici. In this study, deletion of PfmaH resulted in loss of melanin and affected conidia cell wall integrity. Specifically, PfmaH directly regulates the expression of scytalone dehydratase, which catalyzes the transition of scytalone to T3 HN. However, PfmaF disruption using CRISPR/Cas9 system affected neither DHN melanin distribution nor conidia cell wall integrity in P. fici. Unexpectedly, overexpression of PfmaF leads to heavy pigment accumulation in P. fici hyphae. Transcriptome and qRT-PCR analyses provide insight into the roles of PfmaF and PfmaH in DHN melanin regulation. PfmaH, as a pathway specific regulator, mainly regulates melanin biosynthesis that contributes to cell wall development. Furthermore, PfmaF functions as a broad regulator to stimulate PfmaH expression in melanin production, secondary metabolism as well as fungal development.	1
Title: Heterologous expression of the trichostatin gene cluster and functional characterization of N-methyltransferase TsnB8 Abstract: Trichostatins are potent inhibitors of histone deacetylase (HDAC). In this work, a new trichostatin derivative isotrichostatin RK (1) and five known compounds trichostatin RK (2), JBIR-111 (3), 9179B (4), trichostatic acid (5) and trichostatin A (6) were isolated from marine-derived Streptomyces sp. SCSIO 40028. The biosynthetic gene cluster (tsnB) for trichostatins was identified from Streptomyces sp. SCSIO 40028 and validated by heterologous expression in Streptomyces lividans TK64. N-Methyltransferase TsnB8 was demonstrated to catalyze successive methyltransfer reactions by in vivo gene inactivation and in vitro enzyme assays.	1
Title: Molecular characterization of HbCDPK1, an ethephon-induced calcium-dependent protein kinase gene of Hevea brasiliensis Abstract: Calcium-dependent protein kinases (CDPKs), as major primary Ca(2+) sensors, have been implicated in the regulation of stress and developmental signals in plants. In this study, a novel CDPK gene, designated HbCDPK1, was isolated from Hevea brasiliensis. The HbCDPK1 cDNA had 2,400 bp with an open reading frame of 1,671 bp encoding 556 amino acids, and the deduced HbCDPK1 protein contained four characteristic domains identified in CDPKs, showing a high level of sequence similarity to CDPKs from other plants. Expression analysis revealed more significant accumulation of the transcripts of HbCDPK1 in latex than in the leaves, bark, and roots in H. brasiliensis. In addition, transcription of HbCDPK1 was strongly induced by mechanical wounding, jasmonic acid (JA), and ethephon. Recombinant HbCDPK1 was expressed in E. coli, and its activity was assayed. The assay indicated that HbCDPK1 had the kinase and Ca(2+)-binding activity in vitro as a calcium-dependent protein. The potential roles of the HbCDPK1 are discussed as to latex production and rubber biosynthesis.	0
Title: Molecular cloning, sequence analysis and functional characterization of the gene cluster for biosynthesis of K-252a and its analogs Abstract: Among the indolocarbazole alkaloids of antitumor antibiotics, K-252a represents a structurally unique indolocarbazole glycoside and exhibits potent neuroprotective and broad anticancer activities. K-252a consists of K-252c and the unusual dihydrostreptose moiety, linked together with oxidative and glycosidic C-N bonds. Herein, we reported a complete sequence of an approximately 45 kb genomic fragment harboring the gene cluster for the biosynthesis of indolocarbazole alkaloids in Nocardiopsis sp. K-252 (NRRL15532). The sequence of 35 open reading frames discovered several new, critical genes, hence shedding new light on biosynthesis, resistance and regulation of K-252a and its analogs. To functionally characterize the gene cluster in vitro and in enzyme level, a multigene expression cassette containing the K-252c biosynthetic genes was constructed and successfully overexpressed in Escherichia coli to yield soluble proteins for cell-free tandem enzymatic assays. Consequently, the heterologous expression with soluble NokA and NokB led to in vitro production of chromopyrrolic acid (CPA), thereby providing functional evidence for K-252c biosynthesis. Moreover, a facile production of CPA in culture broth was successfully accomplished by using an in vivo biotransformation of L-tryptophan with E. coli harboring the gene cassette. Importantly, by sequence analysis and the functional characterization here and in the companion paper, biosynthetic pathways leading to formation of K-252a and its analogs were hence proposed. Together, the results provide critical information and materials useful for combinatorial biosynthesis of K-252a and its analogs for therapeutic applications.	1
Title: Investigating Mithramycin deoxysugar biosynthesis: enzymatic total synthesis of TDP-D-olivose Abstract: Mix'n'match: Enzymatic total synthesis of TDP-D-olivose was achieved, starting from TDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-D-glucose, by combining three pathway enzymes with one cofactor-regenerating enzyme. The results also revealed that MtmC is a bifunctional enzyme that can perform a 4-ketoreduction necessary for D-olivose biosynthesis besides the previously found C-methyltransfer for D-mycarose biosynthesis.	0
Title: High specificity, electrochemical sandwich assays based on single aptamer sequences and suitable for the direct detection of small-molecule targets in blood and other complex matrices Abstract: We herein demonstrate a sandwich assay based on single aptamer sequences is suitable for the direct detection of small molecule targets in blood serum and other complex matrices. By splitting an aptamer into two pieces, we convert a single affinity reagent into a two-component system in which the presence of the target drives formation of a complex comprised of the target and the two halves of the aptamer. To demonstrate the utility of this approach we have used single anticocaine and anti-ATP aptamers to fabricate electrochemical sensors directed against the representative small molecules cocaine and ATP. Both targets are detected at low micromolar concentrations, in seconds, and in a convenient, general, readily reusable, electrochemical format. Moreover, both sensors are selective enough to deploy directly in blood, crude cellular lysates and other complex sample matrices.	0
Title: Function of glycosyltransferase genes involved in urdamycin A biosynthesis Abstract: Background:                       Urdamycin A, the principle product of Streptomyces fradiae Tü2717, is an angucycline-type antibiotic. The polyketide-derived aglycone moiety is glycosylated at two positions, but only limited information is available about glycosyltransferases involved in urdamycin biosynthesis.                  Results:                       To determine the function of three glycosyltransferase genes in the urdamycin biosynthetic gene cluster, we have carried out gene inactivation and expression experiments. Inactivation of urdGT1a resulted in the predominant accumulation of urdamycin B. A mutant lacking urdGT1b and urdGT1c mainly produced compound 100-2. When urdGT1c was expressed in the urdGT1b/urdGT1c double mutant, urdamycin G and urdamycin A were detected. The mutant lacking all three genes mainly accumulated aquayamycin and urdamycinone B. Expression of urdGT1c in the triple mutant led to the formation of compound 100-1, whereas expression of urdGT1a resulted in the formation of compound 100-2. Co-expression of urdGT1b and urdGT1c resulted in the production of 12b-derhodinosyl-urdamycin A, and co-expression of urdGT1a, urdGT1b and urdGT1c resulted in the formation of urdamycin A.                  Conclusions:                       Analysis of glycosyltransferase genes of the urdamycin biosynthetic gene cluster led to an unambiguous assignment of each glycosyltransferase to a certain biosynthetic saccharide attachment step.	1
Title: Repair of Alkylation Damage in Eukaryotic Chromatin Depends on Searching Ability of Alkyladenine DNA Glycosylase Abstract: Human alkyladenine DNA glycosylase (AAG) initiates the base excision repair pathway by excising alkylated and deaminated purine lesions. In vitro biochemical experiments demonstrate that AAG uses facilitated diffusion to efficiently search DNA to find rare sites of damage and suggest that electrostatic interactions are critical to the searching process. However, it remains an open question whether DNA searching limits the rate of DNA repair in vivo. We constructed AAG mutants with altered searching ability and measured their ability to protect yeast from alkylation damage in order to address this question. Each of the conserved arginine and lysine residues that are near the DNA binding interface were mutated, and the functional impacts were evaluated using kinetic and thermodynamic analysis. These mutations do not perturb catalysis of N-glycosidic bond cleavage, but they decrease the ability to capture rare lesion sites. Nonspecific and specific DNA binding properties are closely correlated, suggesting that the electrostatic interactions observed in the specific recognition complex are similarly important for DNA searching complexes. The ability of the mutant proteins to complement repair-deficient yeast cells is positively correlated with the ability of the proteins to search DNA in vitro, suggesting that cellular resistance to DNA alkylation is governed by the ability to find and efficiently capture cytotoxic lesions. It appears that chromosomal access is not restricted and toxic sites of alkylation damage are readily accessible to a searching protein.	0
Title: Mutations in the scaffoldin gene, cipA, of Clostridium thermocellum with impaired cellulosome formation and cellulose hydrolysis: insertions of a new transposable element, IS1447, and implications for cellulase synergism on crystalline cellulose Abstract: Mutants of Clostridium thermocellum that had lost the ability to adhere to microcrystalline cellulose were isolated. Six of them that showed diminished ability to depolymerize crystalline cellulose were selected. Size exclusion chromatography of the proteins from the culture supernatant revealed the loss of the supramolecular enzyme complex, the cellulosome. However, denaturing sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis resulted in extracellular protein patterns comparable to those of isolated cellulosomes, except for a missing CipA band. Sequencing of the six mutant cipA genes revealed a new insertion (IS) element, IS1447, belonging to the IS3 family. It was inserted into the cipA reading frame in four different locations: cohesin module 1, two different positions in the carbohydrate binding module, and cohesin module 3. The IS sequences were identical and consisted of a transposase gene and the inverted repeats IRR and IRS. The insertion resulted in an obviously nonspecific duplication of 3 base pairs within the target sequence. This lack of specificity allows transposition without the need of a defined target DNA sequence. Eighteen copies of IS1447 were identified in the genomic sequence of C. thermocellum ATCC 27405. At least one of them can be activated for transposition. Compared to the wild type, the mutant culture supernatant, with a completely defective CipA protein, showed equal specific hydrolytic activity against soluble beta-glucan but a 15-fold reduction in specific activity with crystalline cellulose. These results identify a genetic basis for the synergistic effect of complex formation on crystalline-cellulose degradation.	0
Title: Functional expression of a highly-reducing polyketide synthase of Emericella variecolor IFM42010, an asteltoxin-producing strain, resulted in production of two polyenoic β-ketolactones with opposite stereochemistry Abstract: The asteltoxin-producing fungus Emericella variecolor IFM42010 possesses 22 highly-reducing polyketide synthase (HR-PKS) genes. Of these, an HR-PKS with a methyltransferase domain but lacking an enoylreductase domain could be involved in the biosynthesis of asteltoxin and related compounds. From six such candidate HR-PKS genes, Ev460pks was analyzed by gene disruption in E. variecolor and heterologous expression in Aspergillus oryzae. The Ev460pks-disrupted strain retained asteltoxin production ability, indicating that Ev460pks is not involved in asteltoxin biosynthesis. The A. oryzae transformant harboring the Ev460pks gene produced compounds 1 and 2, along with several unidentified products possibly decomposed from 2. Spectroscopic analyses revealed that 1 was a 4-methyl-β-ketolactone with a methylheptatriene side-chain at the C-5 position, and 2 was also a 4-methyl-β-ketolactone, bearing a dimethyltetradecahexaene side-chain at the same position. The relative configuration at C-4 in compounds 1 and 2 was opposite.	1
Title: Solving the Puzzle of One-Carbon Loss in Ripostatin Biosynthesis Abstract: Ripostatin is a promising antibiotic that inhibits RNA polymerase by binding to a novel binding site. In this study, the characterization of the biosynthetic gene cluster of ripostatin, which is a peculiar polyketide synthase (PKS) hybrid cluster encoding cis- and trans-acyltransferase PKS genes, is reported. Moreover, an unprecedented mechanism for phenyl acetic acid formation and loading as a starter unit was discovered. This phenyl-C2 unit is derived from phenylpyruvate (phenyl-C3) and the mechanism described herein explains the mysterious loss of one carbon atom in ripostatin biosynthesis from the phenyl-C3 precursor. Through in vitro reconstitution of the whole loading process, a pyruvate dehydrogenase like protein complex was revealed that performs thiamine pyrophosphate dependent decarboxylation of phenylpyruvate to form a phenylacetyl-S-acyl carrier protein species, which is supplied to the subsequent biosynthetic assembly line for chain extension to finally yield ripostatin.	1
Title: Assembly of dimeric variants of coumermycins by tandem action of the four biosynthetic enzymes CouL, CouM, CouP, and NovN Abstract: Coumermycin A(1) is a member of the aminocoumarin family of antibiotics. Unlike its structural relatives, novobiocin and clorobiocin, coumermycin A(1) is a dimer built on a 3-methyl-2,4-dicarboxypyrrole scaffold and bears two decorated noviose sugar components which are the putative target binding motifs for DNA gyrase. Starting with this scaffold, we have utilized the ligase CouL for mono- and bisamide formation with aminocoumarins to provide substrates for the glycosyltransferase CouM. CouM was subsequently shown to catalyze mono- and bisnoviosylation of the resulting CouL products. CouP was shown to possess 4'-O-methyltransferase activity on products from tandem CouL, CouM assays. A fourth enzyme, NovN, the 3'-O-carbamoyltransferase from the novobiocin operon, was then able to carbamoylate either or both arms of the CouP product. The tandem action of CouL, CouM, CouP, and NovN thus generates a biscarbamoyl analogue of the pseudodimer coumermycin A(1). Starting from alternative dicarboxy scaffolds, these four enzymes can be utilized in tandem to create additional variants of dimeric aminocoumarin antibiotics.	1
Title: Evolutionary history of the phl gene cluster in the plant-associated bacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens Abstract: Pseudomonas fluorescens is of agricultural and economic importance as a biological control agent largely because of its plant association and production of secondary metabolites, in particular 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol (2,4-DAPG). This polyketide, which is encoded by the eight-gene phl cluster, has antimicrobial effects on phytopathogens, promotes amino acid exudation from plant roots, and induces systemic resistance in plants. Despite its importance, 2,4-DAPG production is limited to a subset of P. fluorescens strains. Determination of the evolution of the phl cluster and understanding the selective pressures promoting its retention or loss in lineages of P. fluorescens will help in the development of P. fluorescens as a viable and effective inoculant for application in agriculture. In this study, genomic and sequence-based approaches were integrated to reconstruct the phylogeny of P. fluorescens and the phl cluster. It was determined that 2,4-DAPG production is an ancestral trait in the species P. fluorescens but that most lineages have lost this capacity through evolution. Furthermore, intragenomic recombination has relocated the phl cluster within the P. fluorescens genome at least three times, but the integrity of the cluster has always been maintained. The possible evolutionary and functional implications for retention of the phl cluster and 2,4-DAPG production in some lineages of P. fluorescens are discussed.	1
Title: Discovery and biosynthesis of bosamycins from Streptomyces sp. 120454 Abstract: Nonribosomal peptides (NRPs) that are synthesized by modular megaenzymes known as nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) are a rich source for drug discovery. By targeting an unusual NRPS architecture, we discovered an unusual biosynthetic gene cluster (bsm) from Streptomyces sp. 120454 and identified that it was responsible for the biosynthesis of a series of novel linear peptides, bosamycins. The bsm gene cluster contains a unique monomodular NRPS, BsmF, that contains a cytochrome P450 domain at the N-terminal. BsmF (P450 + A + T) can selectively activate tyrosine with its adenylation (A) domain, load it onto the thiolation (T) domain, and then hydroxylate tyrosine to form 5-OH tyrosine with the P450 domain. We demonstrated a NRPS assembly line for the formation of bosamycins by genetic and biochemical analysis and heterologous expression. Our work reveals a genome mining strategy targeting a unique NRPS domain for the discovery of novel NRPs.	1
Title: Induction of Nectriapyrone Biosynthesis in the Rice Blast Fungus Pyricularia oryzae by Disturbance of the Two-Component Signal Transduction System Abstract: Most fungal secondary metabolism genes are poorly expressed under laboratory conditions. Nectriapyrones are known as secondary metabolites produced mainly by symbiotic fungi, including endophytes and plant pathogens. Herein, we show the induction of nectriapyrone production in the rice blast fungus Pyricularia oryzae. The two-component signal transduction system was disturbed by disrupting OSM1 and PoYPD1, which encoded a HOG MAP kinase and a His-containing phosphotransfer (HPt) protein, respectively. This induced the production of two polyketide compounds: nectriapyrone and its hydroxylated analogue. The nectriapyrone biosynthetic gene cluster consists of a polyketide synthase gene (NEC1) and an O-methyltransferase gene (NEC2). Overexpression of the two genes induced overproduction of nectriapyrone and five nectriapyrone analogues, including a new derivative. Nectriapyrone production was not required for the infection of rice. The structure of nectriapyrone is similar to that of the germicidins produced by Streptomyces spp., and nectriapyrone inhibited the growth of Streptomyces griseus.	1
Title: Significance of oxygen transport through aquaporins Abstract: Aquaporins are membrane integral proteins responsible for the transmembrane transport of water and other small neutral molecules. Despite their well-acknowledged importance in water transport, their significance in gas transport processes remains unclear. Growing evidence points to the involvement of plant aquaporins in CO2 delivery for photosynthesis. The role of these channel proteins in the transport of O2 and other gases may also be more important than previously envisioned. In this study, we examined O2 permeability of various human, plant, and fungal aquaporins by co-expressing heterologous aquaporin and myoglobin in yeast. Two of the most promising O2-transporters (Homo sapiens AQP1 and Nicotiana tabacum PIP1;3) were confirmed to facilitate O2 transport in the spectrophotometric assay using yeast protoplasts. The over-expression of NtPIP1;3 in yeasts significantly increased their O2 uptake rates in suspension culture. In N. tabacum roots subjected to hypoxic hydroponic conditions, the transcript levels of the O2-transporting aquaporin NtPIP1;3 significantly increased after the seven-day hypoxia treatment, which was accompanied by the increase of ATP levels in the apical root segments. Our results suggest that the functional significance of aquaporin-mediated O2 transport and the possibility of controlling the rate of transmembrane O2 transport should be further explored.	0
Title: Engineering Aspergillus nidulans for heterologous ent-kaurene and gamma-terpinene production Abstract: Terpenes are a large and varied group of natural products with a wide array of bioactivities and applications. The chemical production of industrially relevant terpenes can be expensive and time-consuming due to the structural complexity of these compounds. Here, we studied Aspergillus nidulans as a heterologous host for monoterpene and diterpene production. Previously, we identified a novel diterpene gene cluster in A. nidulans and showed that overexpression of the cluster-specific transcription factor (pbcR) led to ent-pimara-8(14),15-diene (PD) production. We report further characterization of the A. nidulans PD synthase gene (pbcA). In A. nidulans, overexpression of pbcA resulted in PD production, while deletion of pbcA abolished PD production. Overexpression of Fusarium fujikuroi ent-kaurene synthase (cps/ks) and Citrus unshiu gamma-terpinene synthase resulted in ent-kaurene and gamma-terpinene production, respectively. A. nidulans is a fungal model organism and a close relative to other industrially relevant Aspergillus species. A. nidulans is a known producer of many secondary metabolites, but its ability to produce heterologous monoterpene and diterpene compounds has not been characterized. Here, we show that A. nidulans is capable of heterologous terpene production and thus has potential as a production host for industrially relevant compounds. The genetic engineering principles reported here could also be applied to other Aspergilli.	1
Title: Habituation based synaptic plasticity and organismic learning in a quantum perovskite Abstract: A central characteristic of living beings is the ability to learn from and respond to their environment leading to habit formation and decision making. This behavior, known as habituation, is universal among all forms of life with a central nervous system, and is also observed in single-cell organisms that do not possess a brain. Here, we report the discovery of habituation-based plasticity utilizing a perovskite quantum system by dynamical modulation of electron localization. Microscopic mechanisms and pathways that enable this organismic collective charge-lattice interaction are elucidated by first-principles theory, synchrotron investigations, ab initio molecular dynamics simulations, and in situ environmental breathing studies. We implement a learning algorithm inspired by the conductance relaxation behavior of perovskites that naturally incorporates habituation, and demonstrate learning to forget: a key feature of animal and human brains. Incorporating this elementary skill in learning boosts the capability of neural computing in a sequential, dynamic environment.Habituation is a learning mechanism that enables control over forgetting and learning. Zuo, Panda et al., demonstrate adaptive synaptic plasticity in SmNiO3 perovskites to address catastrophic forgetting in a dynamic learning environment via hydrogen-induced electron localization.	0
Title: Chemoenzymatic synthesis and Fcγ receptor binding of homogeneous glycoforms of antibody Fc domain. Presence of a bisecting sugar moiety enhances the affinity of Fc to FcγIIIa receptor Abstract: Structurally well-defined IgG-Fc glycoforms are highly demanded for understanding the effects of glycosylation on an antibody's effector functions. We report in this paper chemoenzymatic synthesis and Fcγ receptor binding of an array of homogeneous IgG-Fc glycoforms. The chemoenzymatic approach consists of the chemical synthesis of defined N-glycan oxazolines as donor substrates, the expression of the Fc domain in a CHO cell line in the presence of an α-mannosidase inhibitor kifunensine, and an endoglycosidase-catalyzed glycosylation of the deglycosylated Fc domain (GlcNAc-Fc homodimer) with the synthetic glycan oxazolines. The enzyme from Arthrobacter protophormiae (Endo-A) was found to be remarkably efficient to take various modified N-glycan core oxazolines, including the bisecting sugar-containing derivatives, for Fc glycosylation remodeling, resulting in the formation of the corresponding homogeneous Fc glycoforms. Nevertheless, neither Endo-A nor the Mucor hiemalis endoglycosidase mutants (EndoM-N175A and EndoM-N175Q) were able to transfer full-length complex-type N-glycan to the Fc domain, implicating the limitations of these two enzymes in Fc glycosylation remodeling. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) binding studies with the synthetic IgG-Fc glycoforms unambiguously proved that the presence of a bisecting GlcNAc moiety could significantly enhance the binding of Fc to FcγRIIIa, the activating Fcγ receptor, independent of Fc core-fucosylation. Interestingly, the Fc glycoforms carrying an unusual bisecting sugar moiety such as a mannose or a LacNAc moiety also demonstrated enhanced affinity to FcγRIIIa. On the orther hand, the presence of a bisecting GlcNAc or core-fucosylation had little effect on the affinity of Fc to the inhibitory Fcγ receptor, FcγRIIb. Our experimental data also showed that the α-linked mannose residues in the pentasaccharide Man3GlcNAc2 core was essential to maintain a high affinity of Fc to both FcγRIIIa and FcγRIIb. The synthetic homogeneous Fc glycoforms thus provide a useful tool for elucidating how a fine Fc N-glycan structure precisely affects the function of the Fc domain.	0
Title: Genome sequence of Streptococcus mutans bacteriophage M102 Abstract: Bacteriophage M102 is a lytic phage specific for serotype c strains of Streptococcus mutans, a causative agent of dental caries. In this study, the complete genome sequence of M102 was determined. The genome is 31,147 bp in size and contains 41 ORFs. Most of the ORFs encoding putative phage structural proteins show similarity to those from bacteriophages from Streptococcus thermophilus. Bioinformatic analysis indicated that the M102 genome contains an unusual lysis cassette, which encodes a holin and two lytic enzymes.	0
Title: Bacterial Production of a Pederin Analogue by a Free-Living Marine Alphaproteobacterium Abstract: The polyketide pederin family are cytotoxic compounds isolated from insects, lichen, and marine sponges. During the past decade, different uncultivable bacteria symbionts have been proposed as the real producers of these compounds, such as those found in insects, lichen, and marine sponges, and their trans-AT polyketide synthase gene clusters have been identified. Herein we report the isolation and biological activities of a new analogue of the pederin family, compound 1, from the culture of a marine heterotrophic alphaproteobacterium, Labrenzia sp. PHM005. This is the first report of the production of a pederin-type compound by a free-living marine bacteria that could be cultured in the laboratory.	1
Title: Biosynthesis of polyketomycin produced by Streptomyces diastatochromogenes Tü 6028 Abstract: The biosynthesis of polyketomycin was investigated by feeding 13C-labeled acetate and propionate to the growing cultures of Streptomyces diastatochromogenes Tü 6028. 13C NMR spectral analysis demonstrated the polyketide origin of the aglycone and the dimethylsalicyloyl moieties. The O-methyl group and 6-CH3 of the aglycone as well as 3B-CH3 of L-axenose and 3C-CH3 of the salicyloyl residue were labeled by feeding L-[methyl-13C]methionine. Both deoxysugars emerged from D-glucose. The biosynthesis of the aglycone and the assembly of the glycoside are discussed. The polyketomycin producing strain may be a candidate for further exploration in combinatorial biosynthesis.	1
Title: Antibiotic streptolydigin requires noncatalytic Mg2+ for binding to RNA polymerase Abstract: Multisubunit RNA polymerase, an enzyme that accomplishes transcription in all living organisms, is a potent target for antibiotics. The antibiotic streptolydigin inhibits RNA polymerase by sequestering the active center in a catalytically inactive conformation. Here, we show that binding of streptolydigin to RNA polymerase strictly depends on a noncatalytic magnesium ion which is likely chelated by the aspartate of the bridge helix of the active center. Substitutions of this aspartate may explain different sensitivities of bacterial RNA polymerases to streptolydigin. These results provide the first evidence for the role of noncatalytic magnesium ions in the functioning of RNA polymerase and suggest new routes for the modification of existing and the design of new inhibitors of transcription.	0
Title: Geographic Impact on Genomic Divergence as Revealed by Comparison of Nine Citromicrobial Genomes Abstract: Aerobic anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria (AAPB) are thought to be important players in oceanic carbon and energy cycling in the euphotic zone of the ocean. The genus Citromicrobium, widely found in oligotrophic oceans, is a member of marine alphaproteobacterial AAPB. Nine Citromicrobium strains isolated from the South China Sea, the Mediterranean Sea, or the tropical South Atlantic Ocean were found to harbor identical 16S rRNA sequences. The sequencing of their genomes revealed high synteny in major regions. Nine genetic islands (GIs) involved mainly in type IV secretion systems, flagellar biosynthesis, prophage, and integrative conjugative elements, were identified by a fine-scale comparative genomics analysis. These GIs played significant roles in genomic evolution and divergence. Interestingly, the coexistence of two different photosynthetic gene clusters (PGCs) was not only found in the analyzed genomes but also confirmed, for the first time, to our knowledge, in environmental samples. The prevalence of the coexistence of two different PGCs may suggest an adaptation mechanism for Citromicrobium members to survive in the oceans. Comparison of genomic characteristics (e.g., GIs, average nucleotide identity [ANI], single-nucleotide polymorphisms [SNPs], and phylogeny) revealed that strains within a marine region shared a similar evolutionary history that was distinct from that of strains isolated from other regions (South China Sea versus Mediterranean Sea). Geographic differences are partly responsible for driving the observed genomic divergences and allow microbes to evolve through local adaptation. Three Citromicrobium strains isolated from the Mediterranean Sea diverged millions of years ago from other strains and evolved into a novel group.                  Importance:                       Aerobic anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria are a widespread functional group in the upper ocean, and their abundance could be up to 15% of the total heterotrophic bacteria. To date, a great number of studies display AAPB biogeographic distribution patterns in the ocean; however, little is understood about the geographic isolation impact on the genome divergence of marine AAPB. In this study, we compare nine Citromicrobium genomes of strains that have identical 16S rRNA sequences but different ocean origins. Our results reveal that strains isolated from the same marine region share a similar evolutionary history that is distinct from that of strains isolated from other regions. These Citromicrobium strains diverged millions of years ago. In addition, the coexistence of two different PGCs is prevalent in the analyzed genomes and in environmental samples.	0
Title: Cloning, sequencing, and analysis of the griseusin polyketide synthase gene cluster from Streptomyces griseus Abstract: A fragment of DNA was cloned from the Streptomyces griseus K-63 genome by using genes (act) for the actinorhodin polyketide synthase (PKS) of Streptomyces coelicolor as a probe. Sequencing of a 5.4-kb segment of the cloned DNA revealed a set of five gris open reading frames (ORFs), corresponding to the act PKS genes, in the following order: ORF1 for a ketosynthase, ORF2 for a chain length-determining factor, ORF3 for an acyl carrier protein, ORF5 for a ketoreductase, and ORF4 for a cyclase-dehydrase. Replacement of the gris genes with a marker gene in the S. griseus genome by using a single-stranded suicide vector propagated in Escherichia coli resulted in loss of the ability to produce griseusins A and B, showing that the five gris genes do indeed encode the type II griseusin PKS. These genes, encoding a PKS that is programmed differently from those for other aromatic PKSs so far available, will provide further valuable material for analysis of the programming mechanism by the construction and analysis of strains carrying hybrid PKS.	1
Title: Targeting Phosphotyrosine in Native Proteins with Conditional, Bispecific Antibody Traps Abstract: Engineering sequence-specific antibodies (Abs) against phosphotyrosine (pY) motifs embedded in folded polypeptides remains highly challenging because of the stringent requirement for simultaneous recognition of the pY motif and the surrounding folded protein epitope. Here, we present a method named phosphotyrosine Targeting by Recombinant Ab Pair, or pY-TRAP, for in vitro engineering of binders for native pY proteins. Specifically, we create the pY protein by unnatural amino acid misincorporation, mutagenize a universal pY-binding Ab to create a first binder B1 for the pY motif on the pY protein, and then select against the B1-pY protein complex for a second binder B2 that recognizes the composite epitope of B1 and the pY-containing protein complex. We applied pY-TRAP to create highly specific binders to folded Ub-pY59, a rarely studied Ub phosphoform exclusively observed in cancerous tissues, and ZAP70-pY248, a kinase phosphoform regulated in feedback signaling pathways in T cells. The pY-TRAPs do not have detectable binding to wild-type proteins or to other pY peptides or proteins tested. This pY-TRAP approach serves as a generalizable method for engineering sequence-specific Ab binders to native pY proteins.	0
Title: Assessment of microbial communities by graph partitioning in a study of soil fungi in two Alpine meadows Abstract: Understanding how microbial community structure and diversity respond to environmental conditions is one of the main challenges in environmental microbiology. However, there is often confusion between determining the phylogenetic structure of microbial communities and assessing the distribution and diversity of molecular operational taxonomic units (MOTUs) in these communities. This has led to the use of sequence analysis tools such as multiple alignments and hierarchical clustering that are not adapted to the analysis of large and diverse data sets and not always justified for characterization of MOTUs. Here, we developed an approach combining a pairwise alignment algorithm and graph partitioning by using MCL (Markov clustering) in order to generate discrete groups for nuclear large-subunit rRNA gene and internal transcript spacer 1 sequence data sets obtained from a yearly monitoring study of two spatially close but ecologically contrasting alpine soils (namely, early and late snowmelt locations). We compared MCL with a classical single-linkage method (Ccomps) and showed that MCL reduced bias such as the chaining effect. Using MCL, we characterized fungal communities in early and late snowmelt locations. We found contrasting distributions of MOTUs in the two soils, suggesting that there is a high level of habitat filtering in the assembly of alpine soil fungal communities. However, few MOTUs were specific to one location.	0
Title: Some properties of site-specific nickase BspD6I and the possibility of its use in hybridization analysis of DNA Abstract: A new method for hybridization analysis of nucleic acids is proposed on the basis of the ability of site-specific nickases to cleave only one DNA strand. The method is based on the use of a labeled oligonucleotide with the recognition site of the nickase hybridized with the target (DNA or RNA) at an optimal temperature of the enzyme (55 degrees C). The two shorter oligonucleotides formed after the cleavage with the nickase do not complex with the target. Thus, a multiple cleavage of the labeled oligonucleotide takes place on one target molecule. The cleavage of the nucleotide is recorded either by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (when a radioactive labeled oligonucleotide is used) or by fluorescence measurements (if the oligonucleotide has the structure of a molecular beacon). The new method was tested on nickase BspD6I and a radioactive oligonucleotide complementary to the polylinker region of the viral DNA strand in bacteriophage M13mp19. Unfortunately, nickase BspD6I does not cleave DNA in the RNA-DNA duplexes and therefore cannot be used for detection of RNA targets.	0
Title: Scaleable catalytic asymmetric Strecker syntheses of unnatural alpha-amino acids Abstract: Alpha-amino acids are the building blocks of proteins and are widely used as components of medicinally active molecules and chiral catalysts. Efficient chemo-enzymatic methods for the synthesis of enantioenriched alpha-amino acids have been developed, but it is still a challenge to obtain non-natural amino acids. Alkene hydrogenation is broadly useful for the enantioselective catalytic synthesis of many classes of amino acids, but it is not possible to obtain alpha-amino acids bearing aryl or quaternary alkyl alpha-substituents using this method. The Strecker synthesis-the reaction of an imine or imine equivalent with hydrogen cyanide, followed by nitrile hydrolysis-is an especially versatile chemical method for the synthesis of racemic alpha-amino acids. Asymmetric Strecker syntheses using stoichiometric amounts of a chiral reagent have been applied successfully on gram-to-kilogram scales, yielding enantiomerically enriched alpha-amino acids. In principle, Strecker syntheses employing sub-stoichiometric quantities of a chiral reagent could provide a practical alternative to these approaches, but the reported catalytic asymmetric methods have seen limited use on preparative scales (more than a gram). The limited utility of existing catalytic methods may be due to several important factors, including the relatively complex and precious nature of the catalysts and the requisite use of hazardous cyanide sources. Here we report a new catalytic asymmetric method for the syntheses of highly enantiomerically enriched non-natural amino acids using a simple chiral amido-thiourea catalyst to control the key hydrocyanation step. This catalyst is robust, without sensitive functional groups, so it is compatible with aqueous cyanide salts, which are safer and easier to handle than other cyanide sources; this makes the method adaptable to large-scale synthesis. We have used this new method to obtain enantiopure amino acids that are not readily prepared by enzymatic methods or by chemical hydrogenation.	0
Title: Identification of the chelocardin biosynthetic gene cluster from Amycolatopsis sulphurea: a platform for producing novel tetracycline antibiotics Abstract: Tetracyclines (TCs) are medically important antibiotics from the polyketide family of natural products. Chelocardin (CHD), produced by Amycolatopsis sulphurea, is a broad-spectrum tetracyclic antibiotic with potent bacteriolytic activity against a number of Gram-positive and Gram-negative multi-resistant pathogens. CHD has an unknown mode of action that is different from TCs. It has some structural features that define it as 'atypical' and, notably, is active against tetracycline-resistant pathogens. Identification and characterization of the chelocardin biosynthetic gene cluster from A. sulphurea revealed 18 putative open reading frames including a type II polyketide synthase. Compared to typical TCs, the chd cluster contains a number of features that relate to its classification as 'atypical': an additional gene for a putative two-component cyclase/aromatase that may be responsible for the different aromatization pattern, a gene for a putative aminotransferase for C-4 with the opposite stereochemistry to TCs and a gene for a putative C-9 methylase that is a unique feature of this biosynthetic cluster within the TCs. Collectively, these enzymes deliver a molecule with different aromatization of ring C that results in an unusual planar structure of the TC backbone. This is a likely contributor to its different mode of action. In addition CHD biosynthesis is primed with acetate, unlike the TCs, which are primed with malonamate, and offers a biosynthetic engineering platform that represents a unique opportunity for efficient generation of novel tetracyclic backbones using combinatorial biosynthesis.	1
Title: The gellan gum biosynthetic genes gelC and gelE encode two separate polypeptides homologous to the activator and the kinase domains of tyrosine autokinases Abstract: The high-molecular-weight exopolysaccharide gellan is an important commercial gelling agent produced in high yield by the Gram-negative bacterium Sphingomonas elodea ATCC 31461. The cluster of genes required for gellan biosynthesis contains the genes gelC and gelE. These encode for two polypeptides homologous to the activator domain and the kinase domain, respectively, of bacterial autophosphorylating tyrosine kinases involved in polysaccharide chain length determination. The GelC/GelE pair is an exception to the biochemically characterized Gram-negative tyrosine autokinases since it consists of two polypeptides instead of a single one. The deletion of gelC or gelE resulted in the abolishment of gellan in the culture medium confirming their role in gellan biosynthesis. In addition, ATP-binding assays confirmed the predicted ATP-binding ability of GelE. Interestingly, GelE contains an unusual Walker A sequence (ASTGVGCS), where the invariant lysine is replaced by a cysteine. This residue was replaced by alanine or lysine and although both mutant proteins were able to restore gellan production by complementation of the gelE deletion mutant to the production level observed with native GelE, only the mutated GelE where the cysteine was replaced by alanine was demonstrated to bind ATP in vitro. The importance of specific tyrosine residues present in the C-terminal domain of GelE in gellan assembly was also determined. The tyrosine residue at position 198 appears to be essential for the synthesis of high-molecular-weight gellan, although other tyrosine residues may additionally contribute to GelE biological function.	1
Title: Biosynthesis of the natural fluorophore legioliulin from legionella Abstract: Let it shine: The biosynthesis of the UV fluorophore legioliulin (1) from Legionella spp. was elucidated and the phenylalanine ammonium lyase LglD responsible for the formation of the starter unit cinnamic acid was biochemically characterized. Additionally, two novel derivatives differing in the starter unit have been identified by mutasynthesis experiments.	1
Title: Cell membrane expression of cardiac sodium channel Na(v)1.5 is modulated by alpha-actinin-2 interaction Abstract: Cardiac sodium channel Na(v)1.5 plays a critical role in heart excitability and conduction. The molecular mechanism that underlies the expression of Na(v)1.5 at the cell membrane is poorly understood. Previous studies demonstrated that cytoskeleton proteins can be involved in the regulation of cell surface expression and localization of several ion channels. We performed a yeast two-hybrid screen to identify Na(v)1.5-associated proteins that may be involved in channel function and expression. We identified alpha-actinin-2 as an interacting partner of the cytoplasmic loop connecting domains III and IV of Na(v)1.5 (Na(v)1.5/LIII-IV). Co-immunoprecipitation and His(6) pull-down assays confirmed the physical association between Na(v)1.5 and alpha-actinin-2 and showed that the spectrin-like repeat domain is essential for binding of alpha-actinin-2 to Na(v)1.5. Patch-clamp studies revealed that the interaction with alpha-actinin-2 increases sodium channel density without changing their gating properties. Consistent with these findings, coexpression of alpha-actinin-2 and Na(v)1.5 in tsA201 cells led to an increase in the level of expression of Na(v)1.5 at the cell membrane as determined by cell surface biotinylation. Lastly, immunostaining experiments showed that alpha-actinin-2 was colocalized with Na(v)1.5 along the Z-lines and in the plasma membrane. Our data suggest that alpha-actinin-2, which is known to regulate the functional expression of the potassium channels, may play a role in anchoring Na(v)1.5 to the membrane by connecting the channel to the actin cytoskeleton network.	0
Title: Effects of prophylactic administration of bacteriophages to immunosuppressed mice infected with Staphylococcus aureus Abstract: Background:                       Bacteriophages can be successfully applied to treat infections caused by antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Until now no attempts have been undertaken to treat infections in immunosuppressed patients with phages. In this work we investigated the prophylactic efficacy of specific bacteriophages in CBA mice treated with cyclophosphamide (CP) and infected with Staphylococcus aureus.                  Results:                       High numbers of bacterial colony-forming units in the organs as well as elevated tumor necrosis factor and interleukin-6 serum concentrations in CP-treated and S. aureus-infected mice were significantly lowered upon application of phages. The phages markedly increased the percentage of circulating neutrophils and immature cells from the myelocytic and lymphocytic lineages in CP-treated, S. aureus-infected mice as well as of myelocytes and immature neutrophils in the bone marrow. In addition, phages stimulated in such mice generation of specific agglutinins against S. aureus.                  Conclusion:                       Application of specific phages to immunosuppressed mice prior to infection with S. aureus proved very effective, suggesting a potential benefit of phage therapy in immunocompromised patients experiencing bacterial infections.	0
Title: Surface Plasmon Resonance Microscopy: From Single-Molecule Sensing to Single-Cell Imaging Abstract: Surface plasmon resonance microscopy (SPRM) is a versatile platform for chemical and biological sensing and imaging. Great progress in exploring its applications, ranging from single-molecule sensing to single-cell imaging, has been made. In this Minireview, we introduce the principles and instrumentation of SPRM. We also summarize the broad and exciting applications of SPRM to the analysis of single entities. Finally, we discuss the challenges and limitations associated with SPRM and potential solutions.	0
Title: Efficient biosynthesis of heterodimeric C3-aryl pyrroloindoline alkaloids Abstract: Many natural products contain the hexahydropyrrolo[2, 3-b]indole (HPI) framework. HPI containing chemicals exhibit various biological activities and distinguishable structural arrangement. This structural complexity renders chemical synthesis very challenging. Here, through investigating the biosynthesis of a naturally occurring C3-aryl HPI, naseseazine C (NAS-C), we identify a P450 enzyme (NascB) and reveal that NascB catalyzes a radical cascade reaction to form intramolecular and intermolecular carbon-carbon bonds with both regio- and stereo-specificity. Surprisingly, the limited freedom is allowed in specificity to generate four types of C3-aryl HPI scaffolds, and two of them were not previously observed. By incorporating NascB into an engineered strain of E. coli, we develop a whole-cell biocatalysis system for efficient production of NAS-C and 30 NAS analogs. Interestingly, we find that some of these analogs exhibit potent neuroprotective properties. Thus, our biocatalytic methodology offers an efficient and simple route to generate difficult HPI framework containing chemicals.	1
Title: The role of two SARP family transcriptional regulators in regulation of the auricin gene cluster in Streptomyces aureofaciens CCM 3239 Abstract: Two regulators, Aur1P and Aur1R, have been previously found to control expression of the aur1 polyketide gene cluster involved in biosynthesis of the angucycline-like antibiotic auricin in Streptomyces aureofaciens CCM 3239 in a cascade mechanism. Here, we describe the characterization of two additional regulatory genes, aur1PR2 and aur1PR3, encoding homologues of the SARP family of transcriptional activators that were identified in the upstream part of the aur1 cluster. Expression of both genes is directed by a single promoter, aur1PR2p and aur1Pr3p, respectively, induced in late exponential phase. Disruption of aur1PR2 in S. aureofaciens CCM 3239 had no effect on auricin production. However, the disruption of aur1PR3 dramatically reduced auricin compared with its parental wild-type strain. Transcription from the aur1Ap promoter, directing expression of the first biosynthetic gene in the auricin gene cluster, was similarly decreased in the S. aureofaciens CCM 3239 aur1PR3 mutant. Transcription from the aur1PR3p promoter increased in the S. aureofaciens CCM 3239 aur1R mutant strain, and the TetR family negative regulator Aur1R was shown to specifically bind the aur1PR3p promoter. These results indicate a complex regulation of the auricin cluster by the additional SARP family transcriptional activator Aur1PR3.	1
Title: Exploiting enzymatic promiscuity to engineer a focused library of highly selective antifungal and antiproliferative aureothin analogues Abstract: Aureothin is a shikimate-polyketide hybrid metabolite from Streptomyces thioluteus with a rare nitroaryl moiety, a chiral tetrahydrofuran ring, and an O-methylated pyrone ring. The antimicrobial and antitumor activities of aureothin have caught our interest in modulating its structure as well as its bioactivity profile. In an integrated approach using mutasynthesis, biotransformation, and combinatorial biosynthesis, a defined library of aureothin analogues was generated. The promiscuity of the polyketide synthase assembly line toward different starter units and the plasticity of the pyrone and tetrahydrofuran ring formation were exploited. A selection of 15 new aureothin analogues with modifications at the aryl residue, the pyrone ring, and the oxygenated backbone was produced on a preparative scale and fully characterized. Remarkably, various new aureothin derivatives are less cytotoxic than aureothin but have improved antiproliferative activities. Furthermore, we found that the THF ring is crucial for the remarkably selective activity of aureothin analogues against certain pathogenic fungi.	1
Title: Applied modern biotechnology for cultivation of Ganoderma and development of their products Abstract: A white-rot basidiomycete Ganoderma spp. has long been used as a medicinal mushroom in Asia, and it has an array of pharmacological properties for immunomodulatory activity. There have been many reports about the bioactive components and their pharmacological properties. In order to analyze the current status of Ganoderma products, the detailed process of cultivation of Ganoderma spp. and development of their products are restated in this review article. These include the breeding, cultivating, extracting bioactive component, and processing Ganoderma products, etc. This article will expand people's common knowledge on Ganoderma, and provide a beneficial reference for research and industrial production.	0
Title: Allosteric activation of the phosphoinositide phosphatase Sac1 by anionic phospholipids Abstract: Sac family phosphoinositide phosphatases comprise an evolutionarily conserved family of enzymes in eukaryotes. Our recently determined crystal structure of the Sac phosphatase domain of yeast Sac1, the founding member of the Sac family proteins, revealed a unique conformation of the catalytic P-loop and a large positively charged groove at the catalytic site. We now report a unique mechanism for the regulation of its phosphatase activity. Sac1 is an allosteric enzyme that can be activated by its product phosphatidylinositol or anionic phospholipid phosphatidylserine. The activation of Sac1 may involve conformational changes of the catalytic P-loop induced by direct binding with the regulatory anionic phospholipids in the large cationic catalytic groove. These findings highlight the fact that lipid composition of the substrate membrane plays an important role in the control of Sac1 function.	0
Title: An Expedient Synthesis of Flexible Nucleosides through Enzymatic Glycosylation of Proximal and Distal Fleximer Bases Abstract: The structurally unique "fleximer" nucleosides were originally designed to investigate how flexibility in a nucleobase could potentially affect receptor-ligand recognition and function. Recently they have been shown to have low-to-sub-micromolar levels of activity against a number of viruses, including coronaviruses, filoviruses, and flaviviruses. However, the synthesis of distal fleximers in particular has thus far been quite tedious and low yielding. As a potential solution to this issue, a series of proximal fleximer bases (flex-bases) has been successfully coupled to both ribose and 2'-deoxyribose sugars by using the N-deoxyribosyltransferase II of Lactobacillus leichmannii (LlNDT) and Escherichia coli purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP). To explore the range of this facile approach, transglycosylation experiments on a thieno-expanded tricyclic heterocyclic base, as well as several distal and proximal flex-bases were performed to determine whether the corresponding fleximer nucleosides could be obtained in this fashion, thus potentially significantly shortening the route to these biologically significant compounds. The results of those studies are reported herein.	0
Title: Exploring the Tunability and Dynamic Properties of MarR-PmarO Sensor System in Escherichia coli Abstract: Transcriptional factor-based biosensors (TFBs) have been widely used in dynamic pathway control or high-throughput screening. Here, we systematically explored the tunability of a salicylic acid responsive regulator MarR from Escherichia coli aiming to explore its engineering potential. The effect of endogenous MarR in E. coli on the MarR-PmarO biosensor system was investigated. Furthermore, to investigate the function of marO binding boxes in this biosensor system, a series of hybrid promoters were constructed by placing the marO binding boxes in the strong constitutive pL promoter. The engineered hybrid promoters became responsive to MarR and salicylic acid. To further study the influence of each nucleotide in the marO box on MarR binding, we employed dynamic modeling to simulate the interaction and binding energy between each nucleotide in the marO boxes with the corresponding residues on MarR. Guided by the results of the simulation, we introduced mutations to key positions on the hybrid promoters and investigated corresponding dynamic performance. Two promoter variants I12AII4T and I12AII14T that exhibited improved responsive strengths and shifted dynamic ranges were obtained, which can be beneficial for future metabolic engineering research.	0
Title: 4-O-acetylation and 3-O-acetylation of trichothecenes by trichothecene 15-O-acetyltransferase encoded by Fusarium Tri3 Abstract: In the biosynthesis of Fusarium trichothecenes, the C-3 hydroxyl group of isotrichodermol must be acetylated by TRI101 for subsequent pathway genes to function. Despite the importance of this 3-O-acetylation step in biosynthesis, Tri101 is both physically and evolutionarily unrelated to other Tri genes in the trichothecene gene cluster. To gain insight into the evolutionary history of the cluster, we purified recombinant TRI3 (rTRI3), one of the two cluster gene-encoded trichothecene O-acetyltransferases, and examined to determine whether this 15-O-acetyltransferase can add an acetyl to the C-3 hydroxyl group of isotrichodermol. When a high concentration of rTRI3 was used in the assay (final concentration, 50 microM), we observed 3-O-acetylation activity against isotrichodermol that was more than 10(5) times less efficient than the known 15-O-acetylation activity against 15-deacetylcalonectrin. The rTRI3 protein also exhibited 4-O-acetylation activity when nivalenol was used as a substrate; in addition to 15-acetylnivalenol, di-acetylated derivatives, 4,15-diacetylnivalenol, and, to a lesser extent, 3,15-diacetylnivalenol, were also detected at high enzyme concentrations. The significance of the trace trichothecene 3-O-acetyltransferase activity detected in rTRI3 is discussed in relation to the evolution of the trichothecene gene cluster.	1
Title: Identification and Verification of the Prodigiosin Biosynthetic Gene Cluster (BGC) in Pseudoalteromonas rubra S4059 Abstract: Pseudoalteromonas rubra S4059 produces the red pigment prodigiosin, which has pharmaceutical and industrial potential. Here, we targeted a putative prodigiosin-synthesizing transferase PigC, and a pigC in-frame deletion mutant did not produce prodigiosin. However, extractions of the pigC mutant cultures retained antibacterial activity, and bioassay-guided fractionation found antibacterial activity in two fractions of blue color. A precursor of prodigiosin, 4-methoxy-2,2'-bipyrrole-5-carbaldehyde (MBC), was the dominant compound in both the fractions and likely caused the antibacterial activity. Also, a stable blue pigment, di-pyrrolyl-dipyrromethene prodigiosin, was identified from the two fractions. We also discovered antibacterial activity in the sterile filtered (nonextracted) culture supernatant of both wild type and mutant, and both contained a heat-sensitive compound between 30 and 100 kDa. Deletion of prodigiosin production did not affect growth rate or biofilm formation of P. rubra and did not change its fitness, as the mutant and wild type coexisted in equal levels in mixed cultures. In conclusion, a prodigiosin biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) was identified and verified genetically and chemically in P. rubra S4059 and a stable blue pigment was isolated from the pigC mutant of S4059, suggesting that this strain may produce several prodigiosin-derived compounds of pharmaceutical and/or industrial potential. IMPORTANCE Pigmented Pseudoalteromonas strains are renowned for their production of secondary metabolites, and genome mining has revealed a high number of biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) for which the chemistry is unknown. Identification of those BGCs is a prerequisite for linking products to gene clusters and for further exploitation through heterologous expression. In this study, we identified the BGCs for the red, bioactive pigment prodigiosin using genomic, genetic, and metabolomic approaches. We also report here for the first time the production of a stable blue pigment, di-pyrrolyl-dipyrromethene prodigiosin (Dip-PDG), being produced by the pigC mutant of Pseudoalteromonas rubra S4059.	1
