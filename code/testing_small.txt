Enthusiasm for mining advanced biofuels from microbial hosts has increased remarkably in recent years. Isoprenoids are one of the highly diverse groups of secondary metabolites and are foreseen as an alternative to petroleum-based fuels. Most of the prokaryotes synthesize their isoprenoid backbone via the deoxyxylulose-5-phosphate pathway from glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate and pyruvate, whereas eukaryotes synthesize isoprenoids via the mevalonate pathway from acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA). Microorganisms do not accumulate isoprenoids in large quantities naturally, which restricts their application for fuel purposes. Various metabolic engineering efforts have been utilized to overcome the limitations associated with their natural and nonnatural production. The introduction of heterologous pathways/genes and overexpression of endogenous/homologous genes have shown a remarkable increase in isoprenoid yield and substrate utilization in microbial hosts. Such modifications in the hosts' genomes have enabled researchers to develop commercially competent microbial strains for isoprenoid-based biofuel production utilizing a vast array of substrates. The present minireview briefly discusses the recent advancement in metabolic engineering efforts in prokaryotic hosts for the production of isoprenoid-based biofuels, with an emphasis on endogenous, homologous, and heterologous expression strategies.	0
Selenium species, particularly the oxyanions selenite (SeO3 (2-)) and selenate (SeO4 (2-)), are significant pollutants in the environment that leach from rocks and are released by anthropogenic activities. Selenium is also an essential micronutrient for organisms across the tree of life, including microorganisms and human beings, particularly because of its presence in the 21st genetically encoded amino acid, selenocysteine. Environmental microorganisms are known to be capable of a range of transformations of selenium species, including reduction, methylation, oxidation, and demethylation. Assimilatory reduction of selenium species is necessary for the synthesis of selenoproteins. Dissimilatory reduction of selenate is known to support the anaerobic respiration of a number of microorganisms, and the dissimilatory reduction of soluble selenate and selenite to nanoparticulate elemental selenium greatly reduces the toxicity and bioavailability of selenium and has a major role in bioremediation and potentially in the production of selenium nanospheres for technological applications. Also, microbial methylation after reduction of Se oxyanions is another potentially effective detoxification process if limitations with low reaction rates and capture of the volatile methylated selenium species can be overcome. This review discusses microbial transformations of different forms of Se in an environmental context, with special emphasis on bioremediation of Se pollution.	0
Cable bacteria are filamentous bacteria that electrically couple sulfide oxidation and oxygen reduction at centimeter distances, and observations in sediment environments have suggested that they are motile. By time-lapse microscopy, we found that cable bacteria used gliding motility on surfaces with a highly variable speed of 0.5 ± 0.3 μm s(-1) (mean ± standard deviation) and time between reversals of 155 ± 108 s. They frequently moved forward in loops, and formation of twisted loops revealed helical rotation of the filaments. Cable bacteria responded to chemical gradients in their environment, and around the oxic-anoxic interface, they curled and piled up, with straight parts connecting back to the source of sulfide. Thus, it appears that motility serves the cable bacteria in establishing and keeping optimal connections between their distant electron donor and acceptors in a dynamic sediment environment.              Importance:                    This study reports on the motility of cable bacteria, capable of transmitting electrons over centimeter distances. It gives us a new insight into their behavior in sediments and explains previously puzzling findings. Cable bacteria greatly influence their environment, and this article adds significantly to the body of knowledge about this organism.	0
Heat treatment is an important controlling factor that, in combination with other hurdles (e.g., pH, aw), is used to reduce numbers and prevent the growth of and associated neurotoxin formation by nonproteolytic C. botulinum in chilled foods. It is generally agreed that a heating process that reduces the spore concentration by a factor of 10(6) is an acceptable barrier in relation to this hazard. The purposes of the present study were to review the available data relating to heat resistance properties of nonproteolytic C. botulinum spores and to obtain an appropriate representation of parameter values suitable for use in quantitative microbial risk assessment. In total, 753 D values and 436 z values were extracted from the literature and reveal significant differences in spore heat resistance properties, particularly those corresponding to recovery in the presence or absence of lysozyme. A total of 503 D and 338 z values collected for heating temperatures at or below 83°C were used to obtain a probability distribution representing variability in spore heat resistance for strains recovered in media that did not contain lysozyme.              Importance:                    In total, 753 D values and 436 z values extracted from literature sources reveal significant differences in spore heat resistance properties. On the basis of collected data, two z values have been identified, z = 7°C and z = 9°C, for spores recovered without and with lysozyme, respectively. The findings support the use of heat treatment at 90°C for 10 min to reduce the spore concentration by a factor of 10(6), providing that lysozyme is not present during recovery. This study indicates that greater heat treatment is required for food products containing lysozyme, and this might require consideration of alternative recommendation/guidance. In addition, the data set has been used to test hypotheses regarding the dependence of spore heat resistance on the toxin type and strain, on the heating technique used, and on the method of D value determination used.	0
Haloalkane dehalogenases (HLDs) have recently been discovered in a number of bacteria, including symbionts and pathogens of both plants and humans. However, the biological roles of HLDs in these organisms are unclear. The development of efficient HLD inhibitors serving as molecular probes to explore their function would represent an important step toward a better understanding of these interesting enzymes. Here we report the identification of inhibitors for this enzyme family using two different approaches. The first builds on the structures of the enzymes' known substrates and led to the discovery of less potent nonspecific HLD inhibitors. The second approach involved the virtual screening of 150,000 potential inhibitors against the crystal structure of an HLD from the human pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv. The best inhibitor exhibited high specificity for the target structure, with an inhibition constant of 3 μM and a molecular architecture that clearly differs from those of all known HLD substrates. The new inhibitors will be used to study the natural functions of HLDs in bacteria, to probe their mechanisms, and to achieve their stabilization.	0
Sequencing technologies have recently facilitated the characterization of bacterial communities present in lungs during health and disease. However, there is currently a dearth of information concerning the variability of such data in health both between and within subjects. This study seeks to examine such variability using healthy adult sheep as our model system. Protected specimen brush samples were collected from three spatially disparate segmental bronchi of six adult sheep (age, 20 months) on three occasions (day 0, 1 month, and 3 months). To further explore the spatial variability of the microbiotas, more-extensive brushing samples (n = 16) and a throat swab were taken from a separate sheep. The V2 and V3 hypervariable regions of the bacterial 16S rRNA genes were amplified and sequenced via Illumina MiSeq. DNA sequences were analyzed using the mothur software package. Quantitative PCR was performed to quantify total bacterial DNA. Some sheep lungs contained dramatically different bacterial communities at different sampling sites, whereas in others, airway microbiotas appeared similar across the lung. In our spatial variability study, we observed clustering related to the depth within the lung from which samples were taken. Lung depth refers to increasing distance from the glottis, progressing in a caudal direction. We conclude that both host influence and local factors have impacts on the composition of the sheep lung microbiota.              Importance:                    Until recently, it was assumed that the lungs were a sterile environment which was colonized by microbes only during disease. However, recent studies using sequencing technologies have found that there is a small population of bacteria which exists in the lung during health, referred to as the "lung microbiota." In this study, we characterize the variability of the lung microbiotas of healthy sheep. Sheep not only are economically important animals but also are often used as large animal models of human respiratory disease. We conclude that, while host influence does play a role in dictating the types of microbes which colonize the airways, it is clear that local factors also play an important role in this regard. Understanding the nature and influence of these factors will be key to understanding the variability in, and functional relevance of, the lung microbiota.	0
Saccharomyces boulardiiis a probiotic yeast that has been used for promoting gut health as well as preventing diarrheal diseases. This yeast not only exhibits beneficial phenotypes for gut health but also can stay longer in the gut than Saccharomyces cerevisiae Therefore, S. boulardiiis an attractive host for metabolic engineering to produce biomolecules of interest in the gut. However, the lack of auxotrophic strains with defined genetic backgrounds has hampered the use of this strain for metabolic engineering. Here, we report the development of well-defined auxotrophic mutants (leu2,ura3,his3, and trp1) through clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-Cas9-based genome editing. The resulting auxotrophic mutants can be used as a host for introducing various genetic perturbations, such as overexpression or deletion of a target gene, using existing genetic tools forS. cerevisiae We demonstrated the overexpression of a heterologous gene (lacZ), the correct localization of a target protein (red fluorescent protein) into mitochondria by using a protein localization signal, and the introduction of a heterologous metabolic pathway (xylose-assimilating pathway) in the genome ofS. boulardii We further demonstrated that human lysozyme, which is beneficial for human gut health, could be secreted by S. boulardii Our results suggest that more sophisticated genetic perturbations to improveS. boulardii can be performed without using a drug resistance marker, which is a prerequisite for in vivo applications using engineeredS. boulardii.	0
Although Mn(2+) is the most abundant substrate of versatile peroxidases (VPs), repression of Pleurotus ostreatus vp1 expression occurred in Mn(2+)-sufficient medium. This seems to be a biological contradiction. The aim of this study was to explore the mechanism of direct oxidation by VP1 under Mn(2+)-deficient conditions, as it was found to be the predominant enzyme during fungal growth in the presence of synthetic and natural substrates. The native VP1 was purified and characterized using three substrates, Mn(2+), Orange II (OII), and Reactive Black 5 (RB5), each oxidized by a different active site in the enzyme. While the pH optimum for Mn(2+) oxidation is 5, the optimum pH for direct oxidation of both dyes was found to be 3. Indeed, effective in vivo decolorization occurred in media without addition of Mn(2+) only under acidic conditions. We have determined that Mn(2+) inhibits in vitro the direct oxidation of both OII and RB5 while RB5 stabilizes both Mn(2+) and OII oxidation. Furthermore, OII was found to inhibit the oxidation of both Mn(2+) and RB5. In addition, we could demonstrate that VP1 can cleave OII in two different modes. Under Mn(2+)-mediated oxidation conditions, VP1 was able to cleave the azo bond only in asymmetric mode, while under the optimum conditions for direct oxidation (absence of Mn(2+) at pH 3) both symmetric and asymmetric cleavages occurred. We concluded that the oxidation mechanism of aromatic compounds by VP1 is controlled by Mn(2+) and pH levels both in the growth medium and in the reaction mixture.              Importance:                    VP1 is a member of the ligninolytic heme peroxidase gene family of the white rot fungus Pleurotus ostreatus and plays a fundamental role in biodegradation. This enzyme exhibits a versatile nature, as it can oxidize different substrates under altered environmental conditions. VPs are highly interesting enzymes due to the fact that they contain unique active sites that are responsible for direct oxidation of various aromatic compounds, including lignin, in addition to the well-known Mn(2+) binding active site. This study demonstrates the limits of versatility of P. ostreatus VP1, which harbors multiple active sites, exhibiting a broad range of enzymatic activities, but they perform differently under distinct conditions. The versatility of P. ostreatus and its enzymes is an advantageous factor in the fungal ability to adapt to changing environments. This trait expands the possibilities for the potential utilization of P. ostreatus and other white rot fungi.	0
Gram-positive bacteria are ubiquitous and diverse microorganisms that can survive and sometimes even thrive in continuously changing environments. The key to such resilience is the ability of members of a population to respond and adjust to dynamic conditions in the environment. In bacteria, such responses and adjustments are mediated, at least in part, through appropriate changes in the bacterial transcriptome in response to the conditions encountered. Resilience is important for bacterial survival in diverse, complex, and rapidly changing environments and requires coordinated networks that integrate individual, mechanistic responses to environmental cues to enable overall metabolic homeostasis. In many Gram-positive bacteria, a key transcriptional regulator of the response to changing environmental conditions is the alternative sigma factor σ(B) σ(B) has been characterized in a subset of Gram-positive bacteria, including the genera Bacillus, Listeria, and Staphylococcus Recent insight from next-generation-sequencing results indicates that σ(B)-dependent regulation of gene expression contributes to resilience, i.e., the coordination of complex networks responsive to environmental changes. This review explores contributions of σ(B) to resilience in Bacillus, Listeria, and Staphylococcus and illustrates recently described regulatory functions of σ(B).	0
Bacterial communities are important for the health and productivity of soil ecosystems and have great potential as novel indicators of environmental perturbations. To assess how they are affected by anthropogenic activity and to determine their ability to provide alternative metrics of environmental health, we sought to define which soil variables bacteria respond to across multiple soil types and land uses. We determined, through 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, the composition of bacterial communities in soil samples from 110 natural or human-impacted sites, located up to 300 km apart. Overall, soil bacterial communities varied more in response to changing soil environments than in response to changes in climate or increasing geographic distance. We identified strong correlations between the relative abundances of members of Pirellulaceae and soil pH, members of Gaiellaceae and carbon-to-nitrogen ratios, members of Bradyrhizobium and the levels of Olsen P (a measure of plant available phosphorus), and members of Chitinophagaceae and aluminum concentrations. These relationships between specific soil attributes and individual soil taxa not only highlight ecological characteristics of these organisms but also demonstrate the ability of key bacterial taxonomic groups to reflect the impact of specific anthropogenic activities, even in comparisons of samples across large geographic areas and diverse soil types. Overall, we provide strong evidence that there is scope to use relative taxon abundances as biological indicators of soil condition.              Importance:                    The impact of land use change and management on soil microbial community composition remains poorly understood. Therefore, we explored the relationship between a wide range of soil factors and soil bacterial community composition. We included variables related to anthropogenic activity and collected samples across a large spatial scale to interrogate the complex relationships between various bacterial community attributes and soil condition. We provide evidence of strong relationships between individual taxa and specific soil attributes even across large spatial scales and soil and land use types. Collectively, we were able to demonstrate the largely untapped potential of microorganisms to indicate the condition of soil and thereby influence the way that we monitor the effects of anthropogenic activity on soil ecosystems into the future.	0
Different model systems have, over the years, contributed to our current understanding of the molecular mechanisms underpinning the various types of interaction between bacteria and their animal hosts. The genus Photorhabdus comprises Gram-negative insect pathogenic bacteria that are normally found as symbionts that colonize the gut of the infective juvenile stage of soil-dwelling nematodes from the family Heterorhabditis. The nematodes infect susceptible insects and release the bacteria into the insect haemolymph where the bacteria grow, resulting in the death of the insect. At this stage the nematodes feed on the bacterial biomass and, following several rounds of reproduction, the nematodes develop into infective juveniles that leave the insect cadaver in search of new hosts. Therefore Photorhabdus has three distinct and obligate roles to play during this life-cycle: (1) Photorhabdus must kill the insect host; (2) Photorhabdus must be capable of supporting nematode growth and development; and (3) Photorhabdus must be able to colonize the gut of the next generation of infective juveniles before they leave the insect cadaver. In this review I will discuss how genetic analysis has identified key genes involved in mediating, and regulating, the interaction between Photorhabdus and each of its invertebrate hosts. These studies have resulted in the characterization of several new families of toxins and a novel inter-kingdom signalling molecule and have also uncovered an important role for phase variation in the regulation of these different roles.	0
The principal mechanism of reducing sulfur into organic compounds is via the synthesis of l-cysteine. Cysteine is used for protein and glutathione synthesis, as well as being the primary sulfur source for a variety of other molecules, such as biotin, coenzyme A, lipoic acid and more. Glutathione and other cysteine derivatives are important for protection against the oxidative stress that pathogenic bacteria such as Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Neisseria meningitidis encounter during infection. With the alarming rise of antibiotic-resistant strains of N. gonorrhoeae, the development of inhibitors for the future treatment of this disease is critical, and targeting cysteine biosynthesis enzymes could be a promising approach for this. Little is known about the transport of sulfate and thiosulfate and subsequent sulfate reduction and incorporation into cysteine in Neisseria species. In this review we investigate cysteine biosynthesis within Neisseria species and examine the differences between species and with other bacteria. Neisseria species exhibit different arrangements of cysteine biosynthesis genes and have slight differences in how they assimilate sulfate and synthesize cysteine, while, most interestingly, N. gonorrhoeae by virtue of a genome deletion, lacks the ability to reduce sulfate to bisulfide for incorporation into cysteine, and as such uses the thiosulfate uptake pathway for the synthesis of cysteine.	0
DNases are abundant among the pathogenic streptococci, with most species harbouring genes for at least one. Despite their prevalence, however, the role for these extracellular enzymes is still relatively unclear. The DNases of the Lancefield group A Streptococcus, S. pyogenes are the best characterized, with a total of eight DNase genes identified so far. Six are known to be associated with integrated prophages. Two are chromosomally encoded, and one of these is cell-wall anchored. Homologues of both prophage-associated and chromosomally encoded S. pyogenes DNases have been identified in other streptococcal species, as well as other unique DNases. A major role identified for streptococcal DNases appears to be in the destruction of extracellular traps produced by immune cells, such as neutrophils, to ensnare bacteria and kill them. These traps are composed primarily of DNA which can be degraded by the secreted and cell-wall-anchored streptococcal DNases. DNases can also reduce TLR-9 signalling to dampen the immune response and produce cytotoxic deoxyadenosine to limit phagocytosis. Upper respiratory tract infection models of S. pyogenes have identified a role for DNases in potentiating infection and transmission, possibly by limiting the immune response or through some other unknown mechanism. Streptococcal DNases may also be involved in interacting with other microbial communities through communication, bacterial killing and disruption of competitive biofilms, or control of their own biofilm production. The contribution of DNases to pathogenesis may therefore be wide ranging and extend beyond direct interference with the host immune response.	0
Regulatory interactions at the lac promoter.Activation of the transcription of genes is central to many processes of adaptation and differentiation in bacteria. Here, I review the molecular mechanisms by which transcription factors can activate the initiation of specific transcripts at bacterial promoters. The story is presented in the context of Marjory Stephenson's pioneering work on enzymatic adaptation in bacteria, and sets the different mechanisms in the greater context of how transcription regulatory mechanisms evolved.	0
Multi-copy single-stranded DNA (msDNA) is composed of covalently bound single-stranded DNA and RNA, and synthesized by retron-encoded reverse transcriptase. msDNA-synthesizing systems are thought to be a recent acquisition by Escherichia coli because, to date, only seven types of msDNA, which differ markedly in their primary nucleotide sequences, have been found in a small subset of E. coli strains. The wide use of E. coli in molecular research means that it is important to understand more about these stable, covalently bound, single-stranded DNA or RNA compounds. The present review provides insights into the molecular biosynthesis, distribution and function of E. coli msDNA to raise awareness about these special molecules.	0
The human gut microbiota controls factors that relate to human metabolism with a reach far greater than originally expected. Microbial communities and human (or animal) hosts entertain reciprocal exchanges between various inputs that are largely controlled by the host via its genetic make-up, nutrition and lifestyle. The composition of these microbial communities is fundamental to supply metabolic capabilities beyond those encoded in the host genome, and contributes to hormone and cellular signalling that support the dynamic adaptation to changes in food availability, environment and organismal development. Poor functional exchange between the microbial communities and their human host is associated with dysbiosis, metabolic dysfunction and disease. This review examines the biology of the dynamic relationship between the reciprocal metabolic state of the microbiota-host entity in balance with its environment (i.e. in healthy states), the enzymatic and metabolic changes associated with its imbalance in three well-studied diseases states such as obesity, diabetes and atherosclerosis, and the effects of bariatric surgery and exercise.	0
Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a microorganism that is well adapted to both clinical and industrial settings, where it can form adherent communities that are difficult to eradicate. New anti-Pseudomonas compounds and strategies are necessary, as the current antimicrobial approaches for the inhibition of biofilm formation and, above all, the eradication of formed biofilms are ineffective. Compounds that belong to the furoxan family, which are well-known NO donors, have recently been shown to display anti-Pseudomonas activity. The present study investigates three furoxan compounds that are substituted at the hetero-ring with electron-withdrawing groups (NO2, CN, CONH2) for their effects on P. aeruginosa PAO1 growth and biofilm formation/dispersal. Of the furoxans tested, only 3-nitro-4-phenylfuroxan (KN455) inhibited the growth of suspended P. aeruginosa PAO1 cultures. Furthermore, KN455 inhibited the formation of both younger and older biofilms with very high yields and thus proved itself to be toxic to planktonic subpopulations. It also displayed moderate eradicating power. The activity of KN455 does not appear to be related to its capacity to release small amounts of NO. Interestingly, the isomer 4-nitro-3-phenylfuroxan (KN454), included for comparison, displayed a comparable antibiofilm rate, but did not show the same antimicrobial activity against suspended cells and planktonic subpopulations. While hypotheses as to the mechanism of action have been formulated, further investigations are necessary to shed light onto the antimicrobial activity of this furoxan.	0
Bacterial persisters are a subpopulation of cells that exhibit phenotypic resistance during exposure to a lethal dose of antibiotics. They are difficult to target and thought to contribute to the long treatment duration required for tuberculosis. Understanding the molecular and cellular biology of persisters is critical to finding new tuberculosis drugs that shorten treatment. This review focuses on mycobacterial persisters and describes the challenges they pose in tuberculosis therapy, their characteristics and formation, how persistence leads to resistance, and the current approaches being used to target persisters within mycobacterial drug discovery.	0
Insects are frequently infected with inherited facultative symbionts known to provide a range of conditionally beneficial services, including host protection. Pea aphids (Acyrthosiphon pisum) often harbour the bacterium Hamiltonella defensa, which together with its associated bacteriophage A. pisum secondary endosymbiont (APSE) confer protection against an important natural enemy, the parasitic wasp Aphidius ervi. Previous studies showed that spontaneous loss of phage APSE resulted in the complete loss of the protective phenotype. Here, we demonstrate that APSEs can be experimentally transferred into phage-free (i.e. non-protecting) Hamiltonella strains. Unexpectedly, trials using injections of phage particles alone failed, with successful transfer occurring only when APSE and Hamiltonella were simultaneously injected. After transfer, stable establishment of APSE fully restored anti-parasitoid defenses. Thus, phages associated with heritable bacterial symbionts can move horizontally among symbiont strains facilitating the rapid transfer of ecologically important traits although natural barriers may preclude regular exchange.	0
Campylobacter jejuni is a major bacterial foodborne-pathogen. Ciprofloxacin is an important antibiotic for the treatment of C. jejuni, albeit high rates of fluoroquinolone resistance have limited its usefulness. Persister-cells are transiently antibiotic-tolerant fractions of bacterial populations and their occurrence has been associated with recalcitrant and persistent bacterial infections. Here, time-kill assays with ciprofloxacin (200×MIC, 25 µg ml-1) were performed in C. jejuni strains 81-176 and RM1221 and persister-cells were found. The frequency of survivors after 8 h of ciprofloxacin exposure was approx. 10-3 for both strains, while after 22 h the frequency was between 10-5-10-7, depending on the strain and growth-phase. Interestingly, the stationary-phase cultures did not display more persister-cells compared to exponential-phase cultures, in contrast to what has been observed in other bacterial species. Persister-cells after ampicillin exposure (100×MIC, 200 µg ml-1) were not detected, implying that persister-cell formation in C. jejuni is antibiotic-specific. In attempts to identify the mechanism of ciprofloxacin persister-cell formation, stringent or SOS responses were not found to play major roles. Overall, this study reports ciprofloxacin persister-cells in C. jejuni and challenges the notion of persister-cells as plainly dormant non-growing cells.	0
Simplified representations can be powerful. Two common examples are sequence logos and ribbon diagrams. Both have been extraordinarily successful in capturing complex static features of sequences and structures. Capturing function is challenging, since activation involves triggered dynamic shifts between ON and OFF states. Here, we show that simple funnel drawings can capture and usefully portray proteins by their cellular triggering mechanism. The funnel shape around the proteins' native states can describe mechanisms of upstream signal integration and downstream response. "Function diagrams" are important: they can combine diverse biochemical data to visually distinguish among activation (or recruitment) mechanisms and tag proteins in cellular networks, clarifying their mechanism at a glance. We create templates for function classification and suggest that they can extend signaling pathway maps. Of note, the diagrams describe free energy landscapes; thus, they can be quantified. We name our dynamic free-energy diagrams dFEDs.	0
Lipid droplets (LDs) have been the focus of intense research for the past decade because of their active engagement in lipid metabolism and relationship with diseases. In contrast to other intracellular organelles, LDs are composed of a mass of hydrophobic lipid esters that is covered with a phospholipid monolayer. The unique architecture makes the LD a formidable object to study by the methods available today, and many fundamental questions remain unanswered. This review focuses on some of those questions, such as how LDs form and grow, how proteins move to and from LDs, and how LDs are related to protein degradation; we will also discuss what is not known about LDs. We think that small LDs that have thus far eluded analysis are the key to resolving many of the above-mentioned questions.	0
Control of cellular transcriptional programs is based on reversible changes in chromatin conformation that affect access of the transcriptional machinery to specific gene promoters. Chromatin conformation is in turn controlled by the concerted effects of reversible, covalent modification of the DNA and histone components of chromatin, along with topographical changes in DNA-histone interactions; all of these chromatin-modifying reactions are catalyzed by specific enzymes and are communicated to the transcriptional machinery by proteins that recognize and bind to unique, covalent modifications at specific chromatin sites (so-called reader proteins). Over the past decade, considerable progress has been made in the discovery of potent and selective small molecule modulators of specific chromatin-modifying proteins. Here we review the progress that has been made toward small molecule control of these mechanisms and the potential clinical applications of such small molecule modulators of chromatin remodeling.	0
Mycolic acids are major and specific lipid components of the mycobacterial cell envelope and are essential for the survival of members of the genus Mycobacterium that contains the causative agents of both tuberculosis and leprosy. In the alarming context of the emergence of multidrug-resistant, extremely drug-resistant, and totally drug-resistant tuberculosis, understanding the biosynthesis of these critical determinants of the mycobacterial physiology is an important goal to achieve, because it may open an avenue for the development of novel antimycobacterial agents. This review focuses on the chemistry, structures, and known inhibitors of mycolic acids and describes progress in deciphering the mycolic acid biosynthetic pathway. The functional and key biological roles of these molecules are also discussed, providing a historical perspective in this dynamic area.	0
Acyl carrier proteins (ACPs) are promiscuous small proteins that play essential roles in the biosynthesis of many natural products, but our understanding of how they interact with various enzymes within larger protein complexes is lacking. In this issue of Chemistry and Biology, Beld and coworkers describe an enzymatic labeling method that will allow tracking of ACPs as they interact with their partners both in vitro and vivo.	0
Cladosporin is an antimalarial drug that acts as an ATP-mimetic to selectively inhibit Plasmodium lysyl-tRNA synthetase. Using multiple crystal structures, Fang et al. (2015) reveal in this issue of Chemistry & Biology the fascinating mechanism responsible for cladosporin selectivity.	0
Targeted endogenous gene activation is necessary for understanding complex gene networks and has great potential in medical and industrial applications. The CRISPR-Cas system offers simple and powerful tools for this purpose. However, these CRISPR-Cas-based tools for activating user-defined genes are unable to offer precise temporal control of gene expression, despite the fact that many biological phenomena are regulated by highly dynamic patterns of gene expression. Here we created a light-inducible, user-defined, endogenous gene activation system based on CRISPR-Cas9. We demonstrated that this CRISPR-Cas9-based transcription system can allow rapid and reversible targeted gene activation by light. In addition, using this system, we have exemplified photoactivation of multiple user-defined endogenous genes in mammalian cells. The present CRISPR-Cas9-based transcription system offers simple and versatile approaches for precise endogenous gene activation in basic biological research and biotechnology applications.	0
Tuberculosis (TB) is a recurring threat to contemporary civilization. It affects not only those within developing countries, but has also appeared again in places where it was once considered eradicated. TB co-infection in patients infected by HIV is, at the time of writing, the most common cause of death. In the field of searching for new antimycobacterial drug leads, compounds of natural origin still remain a promising source. The review is intended to gather information about natural products (metabolites of plants, fungi, bacteria, and marine sponges) that show activity against mycobacterial enzymes. Here, natural metabolites are presented as being inhibitors/activators of the mycobacterial enzymes involved in mycobacterial growth in vitro (ClpC1, ClpP, MurE ligase, mycothiol S-conjugate amidase, β-ketoacyl-ACP synthase, InhA) and in vivo, as regards the host cell (PtpB). Each enzyme is briefly described so as to generate an understanding of its role in mycobacterial growth and engender a perception of the mechanism of action of the studied natural compounds. Furthermore, after the introduction of the enzyme, its inhibitors are listed and exactly characterized.	0
Metabolomics analysis to unravel secondary metabolite dynamics in microorganisms faces the challenge of immense data sets and complex experimental setups.

A wide array of optogenetic tools are available that allow for precise spatiotemporal control over cellular processes. These tools are particularly important to zebrafish researchers who take advantage of the embryo's transparency. However, photocleavable optogenetic proteins have not been utilized in zebrafish. We demonstrate successful optical control of protein cleavage in embryos using PhoCl, a photocleavable fluorescent protein. This optogenetic tool offers temporal and spatial control over protein cleavage events, which we demonstrate in light-triggered protein translocation and light-triggered apoptosis.	0
The mitochondrion is the core site of cell signaling, energy metabolism and biosynthesis. Here, taking advantage of activity-based probes, we synthesized two photocontrollable probes (YGH-1 and YGH-2), composed of a mitochondrial localization moiety "triphenylphosphonium", a photo-triggered group to achieve spatially and temporally controlled protein capture, and an alkyne group to enrich the labeled protein. Proteomic validation was further carried out to facilitate identification of the mitochondrial proteome in HeLa cells. The results show that half of the identified protein hits (∼300) labeled by YGH-1 and YGH-2 belong to mitochondria, and are mostly localized in the mitochondrial matrix and inner mitochondrial membrane. Our results provide a new tool for spatial and temporal analysis of subcellular proteomes.	0
Detergents are widely used for membrane protein structural study. Many recently developed detergents contain multiple tail and head groups, which are typically connected via a small and branched linker. Due to their inherent compact structures, with small inter-alkyl chain distances, these detergents form micelles with high alkyl chain density in the interiors, a feature favorably associated with membrane-protein stability. A recent study on tandem triazine maltosides (TZMs) revealed a distinct trend; despite possession of an apparently large inter-alkyl chain distance, the TZM-Es were highly effective at stabilizing membrane proteins. Thanks to the incorporation of a flexible spacer between the two triazine rings in the linker region, these detergents are prone to folding into a compact architecture in micellar environments instead of adopting an extended conformation. Detergent foldability represents a new concept of novel detergent design with significant potential for future detergent development.	0
Psilocybe magic mushrooms are best known for their main natural product, psilocybin, and its dephosphorylated congener, the psychedelic metabolite psilocin. Beyond tryptamines, the secondary metabolome of these fungi is poorly understood. The genomes of five species (P. azurescens, P. cubensis, P. cyanescens, P. mexicana, and P. serbica) were browsed to understand more profoundly common and species-specific metabolic capacities. The genomic analyses revealed a much greater and yet unexplored metabolic diversity than evident from parallel chemical analyses. P. cyanescens and P. mexicana were identified as aeruginascin producers. Lumichrome and verpacamide A were also detected as Psilocybe metabolites. The observations concerning the potential secondary metabolome of this fungal genus support pharmacological and toxicological efforts to find a rational basis for yet elusive phenomena, such as paralytic effects, attributed to consumption of some magic mushrooms.	0
The synthesis of five new multivalent derivatives of a trihydroxypiperidine iminosugar was accomplished through copper catalyzed alkyne-azide cycloaddition (CuAAC) reaction of an azido ending piperidine and several propargylated scaffolds. The resulting multivalent architectures were assayed as inhibitors of lysosomal GCase, the defective enzyme in Gaucher disease. The multivalent compounds resulted in much more potent inhibitors than a parent monovalent reference compound, thus showing a good multivalent effect. Biological investigation of these compounds as pharmacological chaperones revealed that the trivalent derivative (12) gives a 2-fold recovery of the GCase activity on Gaucher patient fibroblasts bearing the L444P/L444P mutations responsible for neuropathies. Additionally, a thermal denaturation experiment showed its ability to impart stability to the recombinant enzyme used in therapy.	0
We present an automated NMR-guided docking workflow that can be used to generate models of protein-ligand complexes based on data from NOE NMR experiments. The first step is to generate a number of intermolecular distance constraints from experimental NOE data. Then, the ligand is docked on an ensemble of receptor structures to account for protein flexibility, and multiple poses are generated. Finally, we use the NOE-based constraints to filter and score docking poses based on the percentage of NOE constraints that are consistent with protein-ligand interatomic distances. This workflow was successfully used during a lead optimization project to generate models of synthetic protein-protein interaction (PPI) inhibitors bound to the HDM2 protein.	0
Sonodynamic therapy (SDT) for cancer treatment is gaining attention owing to its non-invasive property and ultrasound's (US) deep tissue penetration ability. In SDT, US activates the sonosensitizer at the target deep-seated tumors to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS), which ultimately damage tumors. However, drawbacks such as insufficient ROS production, aggregation of sonosensitizer, off-target side effects, etc., of the current organic/nanomaterial-based sonosensitizers limit the effectiveness of cancer SDT. Very recently, metal complexes with tunable physiochemical properties (such as sonostability, HOMO to LUMO energy gap, ROS generation ability, aqueous solubility, emission, etc.) have been devised as effective sonosensitizers, which could overcome the limitations of organic/nanomaterial-based sonosensitizers. This concept introduces all the reported metal-based sonosensitizers and delineates the prospects of metal complexes in cancer sonodynamic therapy. This new concept of metal-based sonosensitizer can deliver next-generation cancer drugs.	0
Peptides can self-assemble into various hierarchical nanostructures through noncovalent interactions and form functional materials exhibiting excellent chemical and physical properties, which have broad applications in bio-/nanotechnology. The self-assembly mechanism, self-assembly morphology of peptide supramolecular architecture and their various applications, have been widely explored which have the merit of biocompatibility, easy preparation, and controllable functionality. Herein, we introduce the latest research progress of self-assembling peptide-based nanomaterials and review their applications in biomedicine and optoelectronics, including tissue engineering, anticancer therapy, biomimetic catalysis, energy harvesting. We believe that this review will inspire the rational design and development of novel peptide-based functional bio-inspired materials in the future.	0
Nanocarbon-based field-effect transistor (NC-FET) biosensors are at the forefront of future diagnostic technology. By integrating biological molecules with electrically conducting carbon-based platforms, high sensitivity real-time multiplexed sensing is possible. Combined with their small footprint, portability, ease of use, and label-free sensing mechanisms, NC-FETs are prime candidates for the rapidly expanding areas of point-of-care testing, environmental monitoring and biosensing as a whole. In this review we provide an overview of the basic operational mechanisms behind NC-FETs, synthesis and fabrication of FET devices, and developments in functionalisation strategies for biosensing applications.	0
Protein bioconjugates are in high demand for applications in biomedicine, diagnostics, chemical biology and bionanotechnology. Proteins are large and sensitive molecules containing multiple different functional groups and in particular nucleophilic groups. In bioconjugation reactions it can therefore be challenging to obtain a homogeneous product in high yield. Numerous strategies for protein conjugation have been developed, of which a vast majority target lysine, cysteine and to a lesser extend tyrosine. Likewise, several methods that involve recombinantly engineered protein tags have been reported. In recent years a number of methods have emerged for chemical bioconjugation to other amino acids and in this review, we present the progress in this area.	0
Background:                    To detect changes in biological processes, samples are often studied at several time points. We examined expression data measured at different developmental stages, or more broadly, historical data. Hence, the main assumption of our proposed methodology was the independence between the examined samples over time. In addition, however, the examinations were clustered at each time point by measuring littermates from relatively few mother mice at each developmental stage. As each examination was lethal, we had an independent data structure over the entire history, but a dependent data structure at a particular time point. Over the course of these historical data, we wanted to identify abrupt changes in the parameter of interest - change points.              Results:                    In this study, we demonstrated the application of generalized hypothesis testing using a linear mixed effects model as a possible method to detect change points. The coefficients from the linear mixed model were used in multiple contrast tests and the effect estimates were visualized with their respective simultaneous confidence intervals. The latter were used to determine the change point(s). In small simulation studies, we modelled different courses with abrupt changes and compared the influence of different contrast matrices. We found two contrasts, both capable of answering different research questions in change point detection: The Sequen contrast to detect individual change points and the McDermott contrast to find change points due to overall progression. We provide the R code for direct use with provided examples. The applicability of those tests for real experimental data was shown with in-vivo data from a preclinical study.              Conclusion:                    Simultaneous confidence intervals estimated by multiple contrast tests using the model fit from a linear mixed model were capable to determine change points in clustered expression data. The confidence intervals directly delivered interpretable effect estimates representing the strength of the potential change point. Hence, scientists can define biologically relevant threshold of effect strength depending on their research question. We found two rarely used contrasts best fitted for detection of a possible change point: the Sequen and McDermott contrasts.	0
Phage ImmunoPrecipitation Sequencing (PhIP-Seq) is a recently developed technology to assess antibody reactivity, quantifying antibody binding towards hundreds of thousands of candidate epitopes. The output from PhIP-Seq experiments are read count matrices, similar to RNA-Seq data; however some important differences do exist. In this manuscript we investigated whether the publicly available method edgeR (Robinson et al., Bioinformatics 26(1):139-140, 2010) for normalization and analysis of RNA-Seq data is also suitable for PhIP-Seq data. We find that edgeR is remarkably effective, but improvements can be made and introduce a Bayesian framework specifically tailored for data from PhIP-Seq experiments (Bayesian Enrichment Estimation in R, BEER).	0
Background:                    Spatially-resolved transcriptomics has now enabled the quantification of high-throughput and transcriptome-wide gene expression in intact tissue while also retaining the spatial coordinates. Incorporating the precise spatial mapping of gene activity advances our understanding of intact tissue-specific biological processes. In order to interpret these novel spatial data types, interactive visualization tools are necessary.              Results:                    We describe spatialLIBD, an R/Bioconductor package to interactively explore spatially-resolved transcriptomics data generated with the 10x Genomics Visium platform. The package contains functions to interactively access, visualize, and inspect the observed spatial gene expression data and data-driven clusters identified with supervised or unsupervised analyses, either on the user's computer or through a web application.              Conclusions:                    spatialLIBD is available at https://bioconductor.org/packages/spatialLIBD . It is fully compatible with SpatialExperiment and the Bioconductor ecosystem. Its functionality facilitates analyzing and interactively exploring spatially-resolved data from the Visium platform.	0
Background:                    Advancements in genomic sequencing continually improve personalized medicine, and recent breakthroughs generate multimodal data on a cellular level. We introduce MOSCATO, a technique for selecting features across multimodal single-cell datasets that relate to clinical outcomes. We summarize the single-cell data using tensors and perform regularized tensor regression to return clinically-associated variable sets for each 'omic' type.              Results:                    Robustness was assessed over simulations based on available single-cell simulation methods, and applicability was assessed through an example using CITE-seq data to detect genes associated with leukemia. We find that MOSCATO performs favorably in selecting network features while also shown to be applicable to real multimodal single-cell data.              Conclusions:                    MOSCATO is a useful analytical technique for supervised feature selection in multimodal single-cell data. The flexibility of our approach enables future extensions on distributional assumptions and covariate adjustments.	0
Background:                    The cold pressor test (CPT) is a widely used pain provocation test to investigate both pain tolerance and cardiovascular responses. We hypothesize, that performing multi-omic analyses during CPT gives the opportunity to home in on molecular mechanisms involved. Twenty-two females were phenotypically assessed before and after a CPT, and blood samples were taken. RNA-Sequencing, steroid profiling and untargeted metabolomics were performed. Each 'omic level was analyzed separately at both single-feature and systems-level (principal component [PCA] and partial least squares [PLS] regression analysis) and all 'omic levels were combined using an integrative multi-omics approach, all using the paired-sample design.              Results:                    We showed that PCA was not able to discriminate time points, while PLS did significantly distinguish time points using metabolomics and/or transcriptomic data, but not using conventional physiological measures. Transcriptomic and metabolomic data revealed at feature-, systems- and integrative- level biologically relevant processes involved during CPT, e.g. lipid metabolism and stress response.              Conclusion:                    Multi-omics strategies have a great potential in pain research, both at feature- and systems- level. Therefore, they should be exploited in intervention studies, such as pain provocation tests, to gain knowledge on the biological mechanisms involved in complex traits.	0
The immune repertoires of mollusks beyond commercially important organisms such as the pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas or vectors for human pathogens like the bloodfluke planorb Biomphalaria glabrata are understudied. Despite being an important model for neural aging and the role of inflammation in neuropathic pain, the immune repertoire of Aplysia californica is poorly understood. Recent discovery of a neurotropic nidovirus in Aplysia has highlighted the need for a better understanding of the Aplysia immunome. To address this gap in the literature, the Aplysia reference genome was mined using InterProScan and OrthoFinder for putative immune genes. The Aplysia genome encodes orthologs of all critical components of the classical Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling pathway. The presence of many more TLRs and TLR associated adapters than known from vertebrates suggest yet uncharacterized, novel TLR associated signaling pathways. Aplysia also retains many nucleotide receptors and antiviral effectors known to play a key role in viral defense in vertebrates. However, the absence of key antiviral signaling adapters MAVS and STING in the Aplysia genome suggests divergence from vertebrates and bivalves in these pathways. The resulting immune gene set of this in silico study provides a basis for interpretation of future immune studies in this important model organism.	0
Background:                    Acyl carrier proteins (ACP) constitute a very conserved carrier protein family. Previous studies have found that ACP not only takes part in the fatty acid synthesis process of almost all organisms, but also participates in the regulation of plant growth, development, and metabolism, and makes plants adaptable to stresses. However, this gene family has not been systematically studied in sorghum.              Results:                    Nine ACP family members were identified in the sorghum genome, which were located on chromosomes 1, 2, 5, 7, 8 and 9, respectively. Evolutionary analysis among different species divided the ACP family into four subfamilies, showing that the SbACPs were more closely related to maize. The prediction results of subcellular localization showed that SbACPs were mainly distributed in chloroplasts and mitochondria, while fluorescence localization showed that SbACPs were mainly localized in chloroplasts in tobacco leaf. The analysis of gene structure revealed a relatively simple genetic structure, that there were 1-3 introns in the sorghum ACP family, and the gene structure within the same subfamily had high similarity. The amplification method of SbACPs was mainly large fragment replication, and SbACPs were more closely related to ACPs in maize and rice. In addition, three-dimensional structure analysis showed that all ACP genes in sorghum contained four α helices, and the second helix structure was more conserved, implying a key role in function. Cis-acting element analysis indicated that the SbACPs might be involved in light response, plant growth and development regulation, biotic and abiotic stress response, plant hormone regulation, and other physiological processes. What's more, qRT-PCR analysis uncovered that some of SbACPs might be involved in the adaptive regulation of drought and salt stresses, indicating the close relationship between fatty acids and the resistance to abiotic stresses in sorghum.              Conclusions:                    In summary, these results showed a comprehensive overview of the SbACPs and provided a theoretical basis for further studies on the biological functions of SbACPs in sorghum growth, development and abiotic stress responses.	0
Background:                    Single cell mRNA sequencing technologies have transformed our understanding of cellular heterogeneity and identity. For sensitive discovery or clinical marker estimation where high transcript capture per cell is needed only plate-based techniques currently offer sufficient resolution.              Results:                    Here, we present a performance evaluation of four different plate-based scRNA-seq protocols. Our evaluation is aimed towards applications taxing high gene detection sensitivity, reproducibility between samples, and minimum hands-on time, as is required, for example, in clinical use. We included two commercial kits, NEBNext® Single Cell/ Low Input RNA Library Prep Kit (NEB®), SMART-seq® HT kit (Takara®), and the non-commercial protocols Genome & Transcriptome sequencing (G&T) and SMART-seq3 (SS3). G&T delivered the highest detection of genes per single cell. SS3 presented the highest gene detection per single cell at the lowest price. Takara® kit presented similar high gene detection per single cell, and high reproducibility between samples, but at the absolute highest price. NEB® delivered a lower detection of genes but remains an alternative to more expensive commercial kits.              Conclusion:                    For the tested kits we found that ease-of-use came at higher prices. Takara can be selected for its ease-of-use to analyse a few samples, but we recommend the cheaper G&T-seq or SS3 for laboratories where a substantial sample flow can be expected.	0
Background:                    Previous studies have shown that microtubule actin crosslinking factor 1 (MACF1) can regulate osteoblast proliferation and differentiation through non-coding RNA (ncRNA) in bone-forming osteoblasts. However, the role of MACF1 in targeting the competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network to regulate osteoblast differentiation remains poorly understood. Here, we profiled messenger RNA (mRNA), microRNA (miRNA), and long ncRNA (lncRNA) expression in MACF1 knockdown MC3TC‑E1 pre‑osteoblast cells.              Results:                    In total, 547 lncRNAs, 107 miRNAs, and 376 mRNAs were differentially expressed. Significantly altered lncRNAs, miRNAs, and mRNAs were primarily found on chromosome 2. A lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA network was constructed using a bioinformatics computational approach. The network indicated that mir-7063 and mir-7646 were the most potent ncRNA regulators and mef2c was the most potent target gene. Pathway enrichment analysis showed that the fluid shear stress and atherosclerosis, p53 signaling, and focal adhesion pathways were highly enriched and contributed to osteoblast proliferation. Importantly, the fluid shear stress and atherosclerosis pathway was co-regulated by lncRNAs and miRNAs. In this pathway, Dusp1 was regulated by AK079370, while Arhgef2 was regulated by mir-5101. Furthermore, Map3k5 was regulated by AK154638 and mir-466q simultaneously. AK003142 and mir-3082-5p as well as Ak141402 and mir-446 m-3p were identified as interacting pairs that regulate target genes.              Conclusion:                    This study revealed the global expression profile of ceRNAs involved in the differentiation of MC3TC‑E1 osteoblasts induced by MACF1 deletion. These results indicate that loss of MACF1 activates a comprehensive ceRNA network to regulate osteoblast proliferation.	0
F-9775A and F-9775B are cathepsin K inhibitors that arise from a chromatin remodelling deletant strain of Aspergillus nidulans. A polyketide synthase gene has been determined to be responsible for their formation and for the simpler, archetypical polyketide orsellinic acid. We have discovered simple culture conditions that result in the production of the three compounds, and this facilitates analysis of the genes responsible for their synthesis. We have now analysed the F9775/orsellinic acid gene cluster using a set of targeted deletions. We find that the polyketide synthase alone is required for orsellinic acid biosynthesis and only two additional genes in the cluster are required for F9775 A and B synthesis. Our deletions also yielded the bioactive metabolites gerfelin and diorcinol.	1
FD-891 is a 16-membered cytotoxic antibiotic macrolide that is especially active against human leukemia such as HL-60 and Jurkat cells. We identified the FD-891 biosynthetic (gfs) gene cluster from the producer Streptomyces graminofaciens A-8890 by using typical modular type I polyketide synthase (PKS) genes as probes. The gfs gene cluster contained five typical modular type I PKS genes (gfsA, B, C, D, and E), a cytochrome P450 gene (gfsF), a methyltransferase gene (gfsG), and a regulator gene (gfsR). The gene organization of PKSs agreed well with the basic polyketide skeleton of FD-891 including the oxidation states and alpha-alkyl substituent determined by the substrate specificities of the acyltransferase (AT) domains. To clarify the involvement of the gfs genes in the FD-891 biosynthesis, the P450 gfsF gene was inactivated; this resulted in the loss of FD-891 production. Instead, the gfsF gene-disrupted mutant accumulated a novel FD-891 analogue 25-O-methyl-FD-892, which lacked the epoxide and the hydroxyl group of FD-891. Furthermore, the recombinant GfsF enzyme coexpressed with putidaredoxin and putidaredoxin reductase converted 25-O-methyl-FD-892 into FD-891. In the course of the GfsF reaction, 10-deoxy-FD-891 was isolated as an enzymatic reaction intermediate, which was also converted into FD-891 by GfsF. Therefore, it was clearly found that the cytochrome P450 GfsF catalyzes epoxidation and hydroxylation in a stepwise manner in the FD-891 biosynthesis. These results clearly confirmed that the identified gfs genes are responsible for the biosynthesis of FD-891 in S. graminofaciens.	1
To date, several actinomycete genomes have been completed and annotated. Among them, Streptomyces microorganisms are of major pharmaceutical interest because they are a rich source of numerous secondary metabolites. S. avermitilis is an industrial microorganism used for the production of an anthelmintic agent, avermectin, which is a commercially important antiparasitic agent in human and veterinary medicine, and agricultural pesticides. Genome analysis of S. avermitilis provides significant information for not only industrial applications but also understanding the features of this genus. On genome mining of S. avermitilis, the microorganism has been found to harbor at least 38 secondary metabolic gene clusters and 46 insertion sequence (IS)-like sequences on the genome, which have not been searched so far. A significant use of the genome data of Streptomyces microorganisms is the construction of a versatile host for heterologous expression of exogenous biosynthetic gene clusters by genetic engineering. Since S. avermitilis is used as an industrial microorganism, the microorganism is already optimized for the efficient supply of primary metabolic precursors and biochemical energy to support multistep biosynthesis. The feasibility of large-deletion mutants of S. avermitilis has been confirmed by heterologous expression of more than 20 exogenous biosynthetic gene clusters.	1
Fostriecin is a unique phosphate monoester antibiotic that was isolated from Streptomyces pulveraceus as a protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) and PP4A selective inhibitor. However, its biosynthetic mechanism remains to be elucidated. In this study, a 73 kb gene cluster encoding a six modular Type I polyketide synthases (PKS) and seven tailoring enzymes was identified by cosmid sequencing from the producer. The functions of two tailoring enzymes were characterized by gene disruption and an in vitro enzyme activity assay. Remarkably, the isolation of three malonylated fostriecin analogs from post-PKS gene knockout mutants indicated malonylated-polyketide formation could be a normal biosynthetic process in the formation of the unsaturated six-membered lactone in fostriecin. Based on this study, a comprehensive post-PKS modification mechanism for fostriecin biosynthesis was proposed.	1
The complete gene cluster for biosynthesis of a polyene complex, FR-008, spans 137.2 kb of the genome of Streptomyces sp. FR-008 consisting of six genes for a modular PKS and 15 additional genes. The extensive similarity to the partially characterized candicidin gene cluster in Streptomyces griseus IMRU3570, especially for genes involved in mycosamine biosynthesis, prompted us to compare the compounds produced by Streptomyces sp. FR-008 and Streptomyces griseus IMRU3570, and we found that FR-008 and candicidin complex are identical. A model for biosynthesis of a set of four structurally related FR-008/candicidin compounds was proposed. Deletion of the putative regulatory genes abolished antibiotic production, while disruption of putative glycosyltransferase and GDP-ketosugar aminotransferase functionalities led to the productions of a set of nonmycosaminated aglycones and a novel polyene complex with attachment of altered sugar moiety, respectively.	1
Fumonisins are toxins associated with several mycotoxicoses and are produced by the maize pathogen Gibberella fujikuroi mating population A (MP-A). Biochemical analyses indicate that fumonisins are a product of either polyketide or fatty acid biosynthesis. To isolate a putative polyketide synthase (PKS) gene involved in fumonisin biosynthesis, we employed PCR with degenerate PKS primers and a cDNA template prepared from a fumonisin-producing culture of G. fujikuroi. Sequence analysis of the single PCR product and its flanking DNA revealed a gene (FUM5) with a 7.8-kb coding region. The predicted FUM5 translation product was highly similar to bacterial and fungal Type I PKSs. Transformation of a cosmid clone carrying FUM5 into G. fujikuroi enhanced production in three strains and restored wild-type production in a fumonisin nonproducing mutant. Disruption of FUM5 reduced fumonisin production by over 99% in G. fujikuroi MP-A. Together, these results indicate that FUM5 is a PKS gene required for fumonisin biosynthesis.	1
Most species of Fusarium that produce fumonisin mycotoxins produce predominantly B fumonisins (FBs). However, Fusarium oxysporum strain O-1890 produces predominantly C fumonisins (FCs). In this study, the nucleotide sequence of the fumonisin biosynthetic gene (FUM) cluster in strain O-1890 was determined. The order and orientation of FUM genes were the same as in the previously described clusters in Fusarium verticillioides and Fusarium proliferatum. Coding regions of F. oxysporum and F. verticillioides FUM genes were 88-92% identical, but regions flanking the clusters did not share significant identity. The FUM cluster gene FUM8 encodes an alpha-oxoamine synthase, and fum8 mutants of F. verticillioides do not produce fumonisins. Complementation of a fum8 mutant with the F. verticillioidesFUM8 restored FB production. Complementation with F. oxysporumFUM8 also restored production, but the fumonisins produced were predominantly FCs. These data indicate that different orthologues of FUM8 determine whether Fusarium produces predominantly FBs or FCs.	1
Fragments of polyketide synthase (PKS) genes were amplified from complementary DNA (cDNA) of the fusarin C producing filamentous fungi Fusarium moniliforme and Fusarium venenatum by using degenerate oligonucleotides designed to select for fungal PKS C-methyltransferase (CMeT) domains. The PCR products, which were highly homologous to fragments of known fungal PKS CMeT domains, were used to probe cDNA and genomic DNA (gDNA) libraries of F. moniliforme and F. venenatum. A 4.0 kb cDNA clone from F. venenatum was isolated and used to prepare a hygromycin-resistance knockout cassette, which was used to produce a fusarin-deficient strain of F. venenatum (kb = 1000 bp). Similarly, a 26 kb genomic fragment, isolated on two overlapping clones from F. moniliforme, encoded a complete iterative Type I PKS fused to an unusual nonribosomal peptide synthase module. Once again, targeted gene disruption produced a fusarin-deficient strain, thereby proving that this synthase is responsible for the first steps of fusarin biosynthesis.	1
Galbonolides A and B are antifungal compounds, which are produced by Streptomyces galbus. A multimodular polyketide synthase (PKS) was predicted to catalyze their biosynthesis, and a methoxymalonyl-acyl carrier protein (methoxymalonyl-ACP) was expected to be involved in the biosynthesis of galbonolide A. Cloning of a methoxymalonyl-ACP biosynthesis locus (galGHIJK) and the flanking regions has revealed that the locus is colocalized with beta-ketoacyl synthase (KAS)-related genes (orf3, 4, and 5), but separated from any multimodular PKS gene cluster in S. galbus. A galI-disruption mutant (SK-galI-5) is unable to produce galbonolide A, but can synthesize galbonolide B, indicating that galGHIJK is involved in the biosynthesis of galbonolide A. A disruption mutant of orf4 is severely impaired in the production of both galbonolides A and B. These results indicate that galGHIJK and the KAS genes are involved in the biosynthesis of galbonolides, although they are not colocalized with a multimodular PKS gene cluster. We further propose that a single galbonolide PKS generates two discrete structures, galbonolides A and B, by alternatively incorporating methoxymalonate and methylmalonate, respectively.	1
We illustrate the use of a PCR-based method by which the genomic DNA of a microorganism can be rapidly queried for the presence of type I modular polyketide synthase genes to clone and characterize, by sequence analysis and gene disruption, a major portion of the geldanamycin production gene cluster from Streptomyces hygroscopicus var. geldanus NRRL 3602.	1
Geldanamycin and its analogs are important anticancer agents that inhibit the newly targeted, heat-shock protein (Hsp) 90, which is a chaperone protein in eukaryotic cells. To resolve which geldanamycin biosynthetic genes are responsible for particular post-polyketide synthase (PKS) processing steps and in which order the reactions occur, we individually inactivated candidate genes in Streptomyces hygroscopicus subsp. duamyceticus JCM4427, and isolated and elucidated the structures of intermediates from each mutant. The results indicated that gel7 governs at least one of the benzoquinone ring oxidation steps. In addition, gel16 was found to be involved in double-bond formation between C-4 and C-5 of 4,5-dihydrogeldanamycin, which confirmed our previous findings that this double bond reduced during the post-PKS modification of the polyketide assembly. In addition, pro-geldanamycin, which does not possess a double bond at C-4/5, was purified from the gel7 and 8 double-gene-inactivated mutant.	1
The recent sequencing of the DNA region of the geldanamycin post-polyketide synthase (PKS) modification gene clusters revealed the presence of two regulatory genes: gdmRI (2,907 bp) and gdmRII (2,766 bp). The deduced products of gdmRI and gdmRII (968 and 921 amino acid residues, respectively) were identified as homologues of the LuxR transcriptional regulatory proteins. Inactivation by gene replacement of gdmRI or gdmRII in the Streptomyces hygroscopicus 17997 genome resulted in a complete loss of geldanamycin production. Complementation by a plasmid carrying gdmRI or gdmRII restored geldanamycin production, suggesting that the products of these two regulatory genes are positive regulators that are required for geldanamycin biosynthesis. The gdmRI transcript was detected in the DeltagdmRII mutant, and the gdmRII was detected in the DeltagdmRI mutant, indicating that the two genes are transcribed independently and do not regulate each other. Time course of gene expression analysis by RT-PCR of the geldanamycin biosynthetic genes showed that the transcription of gdmRI and gdmRII correlates with that of genes involved in polyketide biosynthesis, but not with the post-PKS modification gene gdmN, whose transcription is initiated earlier. gdmRI or gdmRII gene disruptants did not transcribe the polyketide biosynthetic related genes pks, gdmF, and gdnA-O-P, but did trancribe gdmN. These results demonstrated that gdmRI and gdmRII are pathway-specific positive regulators that control the polyketide biosynthetic genes in geldanamycin biosynthesis, but not the post-PKS modification gene, gdmN.	1
Gephyronic acid, a cytostatic polyketide produced by the myxobacterium Cystobacter violaceus Cb vi76, exhibits potent and selective eukaryotic protein synthesis inhibition. Next-generation sequencing of the C. violaceus genome revealed five type I polyketide synthases and post-PKS tailoring enzymes including an O-methyltransferase and a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase. Seven methyltransferase (MT) domains embedded within the PKS subunits were found to install the methyl branches throughout the gephyronic acid skeleton. A rare loading domain from the GNAT superfamily also contains an embedded MT domain that catalyzes the in situ production of an isobutyryl starter unit. Phylogenetic analysis identified new motifs that distinguish MT domains located in PKS pathways with in cis acyltransferase (AT) domains from MT domains located in PKS pathways with trans AT enzymes. The identification of the gene cluster sets the stage for the generation of a heterologous expression system, which will allow further investigation of selective eukaryotic protein synthesis inhibitors through the generation of gephyronic acid analogues.	1
Griseofulvin (1) is a spirocyclic fungal natural product used in treatment of fungal dermatophytes. Formation of the spirocycle, or the grisan scaffold, from a benzophenone precursor is critical for the activity of 1. In this study, we have systematically characterized each of the biosynthetic enzymes related to the biogenesis of 1, including the characterization of a new polyketide synthase GsfA that synthesizes the benzophenone precursor and a cytochrome P450 GsfF that performs oxidative coupling between the orcinol and the phloroglucinol rings to yield the grisan structure. Notably, the finding of GsfF is in sharp contrast to the copper-dependent dihydrogeodin oxidase that performs a similar reaction in the geodin biosynthetic pathway. The biosynthetic knowledge enabled the in vitro total biosynthesis of 1 from malonyl-CoA using all purified enzyme components. This work therefore completely maps out the previously unresolved enzymology of the biosynthesis of a therapeutically relevant natural product.	1
The gulmirecins constitute a new class of glycosylated macrolides that were isolated from the predatory bacterium Pyxidicoccus fallax HKI 727. Their structures were solved by a combination of NMR spectroscopic experiments and chemical derivatization. Analysis of the annotated gulmirecin gene cluster complemented the configurational assignment and provided insights into the stereochemical course of the biosynthetic assembly. The gulmirecins exhibit strong activity against staphylococci, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, but no cytotoxic effects on human cells.	1
Halstoctacoanolides A and B are 28-membered polyketide macrolactones and were isolated from Streptomyces halstedii HC34. The biosynthetic gene cluster (hls cluster) of halstoctacosanolides was completely identified from the genome library of Streptomyces halstedii HC34. DNA sequence analysis of ca. 100 kb region revealed that there were seven type I polyketide synthases (PKSs) and two cytochrome P450 monooxygenases in this cluster. Involvement of the gene cluster in the halstoctacosanolide biosynthesis was demonstrated by the gene disruption of P450 monooxygenase genes. The mutants produced a new deoxygenated halstoctacosanolide derivative, halstoctacosanolide C, which confirmed that the hls gene cluster was essential for the biosynthesis of halstoctacosanolides.	1
Geldanamycin and the closely related herbimycins A, B, and C were the first benzoquinone ansamycins to be extensively studied for their antitumor properties as small-molecule inhibitors of the Hsp90 protein chaperone complex. These compounds are produced by two different Streptomyces hygroscopicus strains and have the same modular polyketide synthase (PKS)-derived carbon skeleton but different substitution patterns at C-11, C-15, and C-17. To set the stage for structural modification by genetic engineering, we previously identified the gene cluster responsible for geldanamycin biosynthesis. We have now cloned and sequenced a 115-kb segment of the herbimycin biosynthetic gene cluster from S. hygroscopicus AM 3672, including the genes for the PKS and most of the post-PKS tailoring enzymes. The similarities and differences between the gene clusters and biosynthetic pathways for these closely related ansamycins are interpreted with support from the results of gene inactivation experiments. In addition, the organization and functions of genes involved in the biosynthesis of the 3-amino-5-hydroxybenzoic acid (AHBA) starter unit and the post-PKS modifications of progeldanamycin were assessed by inactivating the subclusters of AHBA biosynthetic genes and two oxygenase genes (gdmM and gdmL) that were proposed to be involved in formation of the geldanamycin benzoquinoid system. A resulting novel geldanamycin analog, KOS-1806, was isolated and characterized.	1
Hygrocins are naphthoquinone ansamycins with significant antitumor activities. Here, we report the identification and characterization of the hygrocin biosynthetic gene cluster (hgc) in Streptomyces sp. LZ35. A biosynthetic pathway is proposed based on bioinformatics analysis of the hgc genes and intermediates accumulated in selected gene disruption mutants. One of the steps during the biosynthesis of hygrocins is a Baeyer–Villiger oxidation between C5 and C6, catalyzed by luciferase- like monooxygenase homologue Hgc3. Hgc3 represents the founding member of a previously uncharacterized family of enzymes acting as Baeyer–Villiger monooxygenases.	1
Gene clusters for biosynthesis of the fungal polyketides hypothemycin and radicicol from Hypomyces subiculosus and Pochonia chlamydosporia, respectively, were sequenced. Both clusters encode a reducing polyketide synthase (PKS) and a nonreducing PKS like those in the zearalenone cluster of Gibberella zeae, plus enzymes with putative post-PKS functions. Introduction of an O-methyltransferase (OMT) knockout construct into H. subiculosus resulted in a strain with increased production of 4-O-desmethylhypothemycin, but because transformation of H. subiculosus was very difficult, we opted to characterize hypothemycin biosynthesis using heterologous gene expression. In vitro, the OMT could methylate various substrates lacking a 4-O-methyl group, and the flavin-dependent monooxygenase (FMO) could epoxidate substrates with a 1',2' double bond. The glutathione S-transferase catalyzed cis-trans isomerization of the 7',8' double bond of hypothemycin. Expression of both hypothemycin PKS genes (but neither gene alone) in yeast resulted in production of trans-7',8'-dehydrozearalenol (DHZ). Adding expression of OMT, expression of FMO, and expression of cytochrome P450 to the strain resulted in methylation, 1',2'-epoxidation, and hydroxylation of DHZ, respectively. The radicicol gene cluster encodes halogenase and cytochrome P450 homologues that are presumed to catalyze chlorination and epoxidation, respectively. Schemes for biosynthesis of hypothemycin and radicicol are proposed. The PKSs encoded by the two clusters described above and those encoded by the zearalenone cluster all synthesize different products, yet they have significant sequence identity. These PKSs may provide a useful system for probing the mechanisms of fungal PKS programming.	1

A biosynthetic gene cluster for the 24-membered macrolactam antibiotic incednine was identified from the producer strain, Streptomyces sp. ML694-90F3. Among the putative incednine biosynthetic enzymes, a novel pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP)-dependent β-glutamate-β-decarboxylase, IdnL3, was functionally characterized in vitro by demonstrating its (S)-3-aminobutyrate-forming activity with β-glutamate in the presence of PLP. Because (S)-3-aminobutyrate is known for the direct precursor of incednine, this enzyme supplies the unique β-amino acid starter unit. The identified gene cluster encodes five characteristic β-amino acid carrying enzymes, consisting of a pathway-specific ATP-dependent ligase, a discrete acyl carrier protein (ACP), β-aminoacyl-ACP β-amino group-protecting ATP-dependent ligase, dipeptidyl-ACP:PKS-loading ACP dipeptidyltransferase and a terminal amino acid peptidase, which are completely conserved in β-amino acid-containing macrolactam biosynthetic gene clusters. Overall, a plausible biosynthetic pathway for incednine was proposed.	1
Metabolites that harbor a core indane scaffold are found to have diverse biological properties. Indanomycin and related pyrroloketoindanes are ionophores and have demonstrated antiparasitic, insecticidal, and antibacterial activities. To understand the biochemical mechanisms guiding formation of the central indane ring, the biosynthetic gene cluster for indanomycin was identified from Streptomyces antibioticus NRRL 8167 and sequenced to approximately 80 kb; this revealed five genes encoding subunits of a polyketide synthase (PKS) and 18 other open reading frames. The involvement of this cluster in indanomycin biosynthesis was confirmed by deletion mutagenesis. The indanomycin PKS lacks the expected thioesterase at the carboxy terminus of the final module, and instead appears to house an incomplete module containing an unusual cyclase domain. These findings now enable additional detailed genetic and biochemical studies of the mechanisms guiding the generation of pyrroloketoindanes.	1
Ambruticins and jerangolids are structurally related antifungal polyketides produced by Sorangium cellulosum strains. Comparative analysis of the gene clusters and characterization of compounds produced by gene knockout strains suggested hypothetical schemes for biosynthesis of these compounds. Polyketide synthase (PKS) architecture suggests that the pyran ring structure common to ambruticins and jerangolids forms by an intramolecular reaction on a PKS-bound intermediate. Disrupting ambM, encoding a discrete enzyme homologous to PKS C-methyltransferase domains, gave 15-desmethylambruticins. Thus, AmbM is required for C-methylation, but not pyran ring formation. Several steps in the post-PKS modification of ambruticin involve new enzymology. Remarkably, the methylcyclopropane ring and putative carbon atom excision during ambruticin biosynthesis apparently occur on the PKS assembly line. The mechanism probably involves a Favorskii rearrangement, but further work is required to elucidate these complex events.	1
Enediyne natural product biosynthesis is characterized by a convergence of multiple pathways, generating unique peripheral moieties that are appended onto the distinctive enediyne core. Kedarcidin (KED) possesses two unique peripheral moieties, a (R)-2-aza-3-chloro-β-tyrosine and an iso-propoxy-bearing 2-naphthonate moiety, as well as two deoxysugars. The appendage pattern of these peripheral moieties to the enediyne core in KED differs from the other enediynes studied to date with respect to stereochemical configuration. To investigate the biosynthesis of these moieties and expand our understanding of enediyne core formation, the biosynthetic gene cluster for KED was cloned from Streptoalloteichus sp. ATCC 53650 and sequenced. Bioinformatics analysis of the ked cluster revealed the presence of the conserved genes encoding for enediyne core biosynthesis, type I and type II polyketide synthase loci likely responsible for 2-aza-l-tyrosine and 3,6,8-trihydroxy-2-naphthonate formation, and enzymes known for deoxysugar biosynthesis. Genes homologous to those responsible for the biosynthesis, activation, and coupling of the l-tyrosine-derived moieties from C-1027 and maduropeptin and of the naphthonate moiety from neocarzinostatin are present in the ked cluster, supporting 2-aza-l-tyrosine and 3,6,8-trihydroxy-2-naphthoic acid as precursors, respectively, for the (R)-2-aza-3-chloro-β-tyrosine and the 2-naphthonate moieties in KED biosynthesis.	1
The antibiotic kijanimicin produced by the actinomycete Actinomadura kijaniata has a broad spectrum of bioactivities as well as a number of interesting biosynthetic features. To understand the molecular basis for its formation and to develop a combinatorial biosynthetic system for this class of compounds, a 107.6 kb segment of the A. kijaniata chromosome containing the kijanimicin biosynthetic locus was identified, cloned, and sequenced. The complete pathway for the formation of TDP-l-digitoxose, one of the two sugar donors used in construction of kijanimicin, was elucidated through biochemical analysis of four enzymes encoded in the gene cluster. Sequence analysis indicates that the aglycone kijanolide is formed by the combined action of a modular Type-I polyketide synthase, a conserved set of enzymes involved in formation, attachment, and intramolecular cyclization of a glycerate-derived three-carbon unit, which forms the core of the spirotetronate moiety. The genes involved in the biosynthesis of the unusual deoxysugar d-kijanose [2,3,4,6-tetradeoxy-4-(methylcarbamyl)-3-C-methyl-3-nitro-d-xylo-hexopyranose], including one encoding a flavoenzyme predicted to catalyze the formation of the nitro group, have also been identified. This work has implications for the biosynthesis of other spirotetronate antibiotics and nitrosugar-bearing natural products, as well as for future mechanistic and biosynthetic engineering efforts.	1
Lactimidomycin (LTM, 1) and iso-migrastatin (iso-MGS, 2) belong to the glutarimide-containing polyketide family of natural products. We previously cloned and characterized the mgs biosynthetic gene cluster from Streptomyces platensis NRRL 18993. The iso-MGS biosynthetic machinery featured an acyltransferase (AT)-less type I polyketide synthase (PKS) and three tailoring enzymes (MgsIJK). We now report cloning and characterization of the ltm biosynthetic gene cluster from Streptomyces amphibiosporus ATCC 53964, which consists of nine genes that encode an AT-less type I PKS (LtmBCDEFGHL) and one tailoring enzyme (LtmK). Inactivation of ltmE or ltmH afforded the mutant strain SB15001 or SB15002, respectively, that abolished the production of 1, as well as the three cometabolites 8,9-dihydro-LTM (14), 8,9-dihydro-8S-hydroxy-LTM (15), and 8,9-dihydro-9R-hydroxy-LTM (13). Inactivation of ltmK yielded the mutant strain SB15003 that abolished the production of 1, 13, and 15 but led to the accumulation of 14. Complementation of the ΔltmK mutation in SB15003 by expressing ltmK in trans restored the production of 1, as well as that of 13 and 15. These results support the model for 1 biosynthesis, featuring an AT-less type I PKS that synthesizes 14 as the nascent polyketide intermediate and a cytochrome P450 desaturase that converts 14 to 1, with 13 and 15 as minor cometabolites. Comparative analysis of the LTM and iso-MGS AT-less type I PKSs revealed several unusual features that deviate from those of the collinear type I PKS model. Exploitation of the tailoring enzymes for 1 and 2 biosynthesis afforded two analogues, 8,9-dihydro-8R-hydroxy-LTM (16) and 8,9-dihydro-8R-methoxy-LTM (17), that provided new insights into the structure-activity relationship of 1 and 2. While 12-membered macrolides, featuring a combination of a hydroxyl group at C-17 and a double bond at C-8 and C-9 as found in 1, exhibit the most potent activity, analogues with a single hydroxyl or methoxy group at C-8 or C-9 retain most of the activity whereas analogues with double substitutions at C-8 and C-9 lose significant activity.	1
Culture broth of a streptomycete isolate, Streptomyces sp. CS684 showed antibacterial activity on methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin resistant enterococci (VRE). Among purified substances from the organism, CSU-1, which is active against MRSA and VRE, is a C37H62O12Na (M+, 721.3875), and identified as laidlomycin. The anti-MRSA and anti-VRE activity of CSU-1 was stronger than oxacillin and vancomycin. Phylogenetic analysis showed that strain CS684 is very similar to Streptomyces ardus NRRL 2817T, whereas the ability of Streptomyces sp. CS684 to produce laidlomycin was shown to be unique.	1
The complete nucleotide sequence of the large linear plasmid pSLA2-L in Streptomyces rochei strain 7434AN4 has been determined. pSLA2-L was found to be 210 614 bp long with a GC content of 72.8% and carries 143 open reading frames. It is especially noteworthy that three-quarters of the pSLA2-L DNA is occupied by secondary metabolism-related genes, namely two type I polyketide synthase (PKS) gene clusters for lankacidin and lankamycin, a mithramycin synthase-like type II PKS gene cluster, a carotenoid biosynthetic gene cluster and many regulatory genes. In particular, the lankacidin PKS is unique, because it may be a mixture of modular- and iterative-type PKSs and carries a fusion protein of non-ribosomal peptide synthetase and PKS. It is also interesting that all the homologues of the afsA, arpA, adpA and strR genes in the A-factor regulatory cascade in Streptomyces griseus were found on pSLA2-L, and disruption of the afsA homologue caused non-production of both lankacidin and lankamycin. These results, together with the finding of three possible replication origins at 50-63 kb from the right end, suggest that the present form of pSLA2-L might have been generated by a series of insertions of the biosynthetic gene clusters into the left side of the original plasmid.	1
Polyether metabolites are an important class of natural products. Although their biosynthesis, especially construction of polyether skeletons, attracted organic chemists for many years, no experimental data on the enzymatic polyether formation has been obtained. In this study, a putative epoxide hydrolase gene lsd19 found on the biosynthetic gene cluster of an ionophore polyether lasalocid was cloned and successfully overexpressed in Escherichia coli. Using the purified Lsd19, a proposed substrate, bisepoxyprelasalocid, and its synthesized analogue were successfully converted into lasalocid A and its derivative via a 6-endo-tet cyclization mode. On the other hand, treatment of the bisepoxide with trichloroacetic acid gave isolasalocid A via a 5-exo-tet cyclization mode. Therefore, the enzymatic conversion observed in this study unambiguously showed that the bisepoxyprelasalocid is an intermediate of the lasalocid biosynthesis and that Lsd19 catalyzes the sequential cyclic ether formations involving an energetically disfavored 6-endo-tet cyclization. This is the first example of the enzymatic epoxide-opening reactions leading to a polyether natural product.	1
Lasalocid is a highly atypical polyether ionophoric antibiotic, firstly because it contains a type of aromatic ring normally associated with fungal polyketides, and secondly because the formation of its tetrahydropyran ring appears to contravene Baldwin's rules, which predict the kinetically preferred routes for cyclisation reactions in organic chemistry. The lasalocid biosynthetic gene cluster has been cloned from Streptomyces lasaliensis, and the las locus (73,533 bp) was found to contain seven modular polyketide synthase (PKS) genes, including all the activities necessary for the synthesis of the aromatic moiety. Specific deletion from the gene cluster of the flanking lasC gene, which is predicted to encode a flavin-linked epoxidase, abolished production both of lasalocid and of the minor cometabolite iso-lasalocid without leading to accumulation of an identifiable intermediate; this suggests that oxidative cyclisation to form the polyether rings takes place on the PKS before release of the full-length polyketide product. Meanwhile, a mutant in which the adjacent epoxide hydrolase lasB had been deleted produced iso-lasalocid only. Iso-lasalocid differs from lasalocid in the replacement of the tetrahydropyran ring by a tetrohydrofuran ring and represents the kinetically favoured product of cyclisation. The LasB epoxide hydrolase is therefore directly implicated in control of the stereochemical course of polyether ring formation during lasalocid biosynthesis.	1
Polyketides, the ubiquitous products of secondary metabolism in microorganisms, are made by a process resembling fatty acid biosynthesis that allows the suppression of reduction or dehydration reactions at specific biosynthetic steps, giving rise to a wide range of often medically useful products. The lovastatin biosynthesis cluster contains two type I polyketide synthase genes. Synthesis of the main nonaketide-derived skeleton was found to require the previously known iterative lovastatin nonaketide synthase (LNKS), plus at least one additional protein (LovC) that interacts with LNKS and is necessary for the correct processing of the growing polyketide chain and production of dihydromonacolin L. The noniterative lovastatin diketide synthase (LDKS) enzyme specifies formation of 2-methylbutyrate and interacts closely with an additional transesterase (LovD) responsible for assembling lovastatin from this polyketide and monacolin J.	1
A biosynthetic medicinal chemistry approach was applied to the optimization of the natural product Hsp90 inhibitor macbecin. By genetic engineering, mutants have been created to produce novel macbecin analogues including a nonquinone compound (5) that has significantly improved binding affinity to Hsp90 (Kd 3 nM vs 240 nM for macbecin) and reduced toxicity (MTD > or = 250 mg/kg). Structural flexibility may contribute to the preorganization of 5 to exist in solution in the Hsp90-bound conformation.	1
The marine Streptomyces sp. CNQ-617 produces two diastereomers, marineosins A and B. These are structurally related to alkyl prodiginines, but with a more complex cyclization and an unusual spiroaminal skeleton. We report the identification of the mar biosynthetic gene cluster and demonstrate production of marineosins through heterologous expression in a S. venezuelae host named JND2. The mar cluster shares the same gene organization and has high homology to the genes of the red cluster (which directs the biosynthesis of undecylprodiginine) but contains an additional gene, named marA. Replacement of marA in the JND2 strain leads to the accumulation of premarineosin, which is identical to marineosin with the exception that the middle pyrrole (Ring B) has not been reduced. The final step of the marineosin pathway is thus a MarA catalyzed reduction of this ring. Replacement of marG (a homologue of redG that directs undecylprodiginine cyclization to give streptorubin B) in the JND2 strain leads to the loss of all spiroaminal products and the accumulation of 23-hydroxyundecylprodiginine and a shunt product, 23-ketoundecylprodiginine. MarG thus catalyzes the penultimate step of the marineosin pathway catalyzing conversion of 23-hydroxyundecylprodiginine to premarineosin. The preceding steps of the biosynthetic marineosin pathway likely mirror that in the red-directed biosynthetic process, with the exception of the introduction of the hydroxyl functionality required for spiroaminal formation. This work presents the first experimentally supported scheme for biosynthesis of marineosin and provides a new biologically active molecule, premarineosin.	1
Megalomicin is a therapeutically diverse compound which possesses antiparasitic, antiviral and antibacterial properties. It is produced by Micromonospora megalomicea and differs from the well-known macrolide antibiotic erythromycin by the addition of a unique deoxyamino sugar, megosamine, to the C-6 hydroxyl. We have cloned and sequenced a 48 kb segment of the megalomicin (meg) biosynthetic gene cluster which contains the modular polyketide synthase (PKS) and the complete pathway for megosamine biosynthesis. The similarities and distinctions between the related megalomicin and erythromycin gene clusters are discussed. Heterologous expression of the megalomicin PKS in Streptomyces lividans led to production of 6-deoxyerythronolide B, the same macrolactone intermediate for erythromycin. A 12 kb fragment harbouring the putative megosamine pathway was expressed in Saccharopolyspora erythraea, resulting in the conversion of erythromycin to megalomicin. Considering the extensive knowledge surrounding the genetic engineering of the erythromycin PKS and the familiarity with genetic manipulation and fermentation of S. erythraea, the ability to produce megalomicin in this strain should allow the engineering of novel megalomicin analogues with potentially improved therapeutic activities.	1
A cluster encoding genes for the biosynthesis of meilingmycin, a macrolide antibiotic structurally similar to avermectin and milbemycin alpha11, was identified among seven uncharacterized polyketide synthase gene clusters isolated from Streptomyces nanchangensis NS3226 by hybridization with PCR products using primers derived from the sequences of aveE, aveF and a thioesterase domain of the avermectin biosynthetic gene cluster. Introduction of a 24.1-kb deletion by targeted gene replacement resulted in a loss of meilingmycin production, confirming that the gene cluster encodes biosynthesis of this important anthelminthic antibiotic compound. A sequenced 8.6-kb fragment had aveC and aveE homologues ( meiC and meiE) linked together, as in the avermectin gene cluster, but the arrangement of aveF ( meiF) and the thioesterase homologues differed. The results should pave the way to producing novel insecticidal compounds by generating hybrids between the two pathways.	1
In a survey of microbial systems capable of generating unusual metabolite structural variability, Streptomyces venezuelae ATCC 15439 is notable in its ability to produce two distinct groups of macrolide antibiotics. Methymycin and neomethymycin are derived from the 12-membered ring macrolactone 10-deoxymethynolide, whereas narbomycin and pikromycin are derived from the 14-membered ring macrolactone, narbonolide. This report describes the cloning and characterization of the biosynthetic gene cluster for these antibiotics. Central to the cluster is a polyketide synthase locus (pikA) that encodes a six-module system comprised of four multifunctional proteins, in addition to a type II thioesterase (TEII). Immediately downstream is a set of genes for desosamine biosynthesis (des) and macrolide ring hydroxylation. The study suggests that Pik TEII plays a role in forming a metabolic branch through which polyketides of different chain length are generated, and the glycosyl transferase (encoded by desVII) has the ability to catalyze glycosylation of both the 12- and 14-membered ring macrolactones. Moreover, the pikC-encoded P450 hydroxylase provides yet another layer of structural variability by introducing regiochemical diversity into the macrolide ring systems. The data support the notion that the architecture of the pik gene cluster as well as the unusual substrate specificity of particular enzymes contributes to its ability to generate four macrolide antibiotics.	1
Through a combination of chemical and molecular analysis, a new polyene macrolactam named micromonolactam was obtained from two marine-derived Micromonospora species. This new polyene metabolite is a constitutional isomer of salinilactam A but contains a different polyene pattern and one cis double bond, in contrast to the all trans structure reported for salinilactam A. The molecular analysis data also established that micromonolactam is a hybrid polyketide derived from 11 polyketide units and a modified glutamate starter unit.	1
A new compound, designated ML-449, structurally similar to the known 20-membered macrolactam BE-14106, was isolated from a marine sediment-derived Streptomyces sp. Cloning and sequencing of the 83-kb ML-449 biosynthetic gene cluster revealed its high level of similarity to the BE-14106 gene cluster. Comparison of the respective biosynthetic pathways indicated that the difference in the compounds' structures stems from the incorporation of one extra acetate unit during the synthesis of the acyl side chain. A phylogenetic analysis of the beta-ketosynthase (KS) domains from polyketide synthases involved in the biosynthesis of macrolactams pointed to a common ancestry for the two clusters. Furthermore, the analysis demonstrated the formation of a macrolactam-specific subclade for the majority of the KS domains from several macrolactam-biosynthetic gene clusters, indicating a closer relationship between macrolactam clusters than with the macrolactone clusters included in the analysis. Some KS domains from the ML-449, BE-14106, and salinilactam gene clusters did, however, show a closer relationship with KS domains from the polyene macrolide clusters, suggesting potential acquisition rather than duplication of certain PKS genes. Comparison of the ML-449, BE-14106, vicenistatin, and salinilactam biosynthetic gene clusters indicated an evolutionary relationship between them and provided new insights into the processes governing the evolution of small-ring macrolactam biosynthesis.	1
Monacolin K is a secondary metabolite synthesized by polyketide synthases (PKS) from Monascus, and it has the same structure as lovastatin, which is mainly produced by Aspergillus terreus. In the present study, a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clone, mps01, was screened from the BAC library constructed from Monascus pilosus BCRC38072 genomic DNA. The putative monacolin K biosynthetic gene cluster was found within a 42 kb region in the mps01 clone. The deduced amino acid sequences encoded by the nine genes designated as mokA- mokI, which share over 54% similarity with the lovastatin biosynthetic gene cluster in A. terreus, were assumed to be involved in monacolin K biosynthesis. A gene disruption construct designed to replace the central part of mokA, a polyketide synthase gene, in wild-type M. pilosus BCRC38072 with a hygromycin B resistance gene through homologous recombination, resulted in a mokA-disrupted strain. The disruptant did not produce monacolin K, indicating that mokA encoded the PKS responsible for monacolin K biosynthesis in M. pilosus BCRC38072.	1
Monascorubrin and its derivatives are polyketides used as natural colorants for a wide range of food for more than one thousand years. Since the biosynthetic pathway for this ancient chemical compound is unknown and genome sequence unavailable for any Monascus species, monascorubrin production has relied on extraction from fungal cultures of Monascus species. In vitro synthesis and genetic manipulation are not possible. Here we report the polyketide gene cluster and pathway for monascorubrin biosynthesis in Penicillium marneffei, a diffusible red pigment-producing, thermal dimorphic fungus, taking advantage of available genome sequence and faster growth rate than Monascus species. We also documented that the red pigment of P. marneffei is a mixture of more than 16 chemical compounds, which are amino acid conjugates of monascorubrin and rubropunctatin, and showed that this polyketide gene cluster and pathway are also responsible for biosynthesis of ankaflavin and citrinin, a mycotoxin with nephrotoxic activity in mammals. The present study on elucidation of the biosynthetic pathway of monascorubrin is a proof-of-the-concept study that serves as a cornerstone for future studies on monascorubrin biosynthesis pathway dissection in Monascus species.	1
The analysis of a candidate biosynthetic gene cluster (97 kbp) for the polyether ionophore monensin from Streptomyces cinnamonensis has revealed a modular polyketide synthase composed of eight separate multienzyme subunits housing a total of 12 extension modules, and flanked by numerous other genes for which a plausible function in monensin biosynthesis can be ascribed. Deletion of essentially all these clustered genes specifically abolished monensin production, while overexpression in S. cinnamonensis of the putative pathway-specific regulatory gene monR led to a fivefold increase in monensin production. Experimental support is presented for a recently-proposed mechanism, for oxidative cyclization of a linear polyketide intermediate, involving four enzymes, the products of monBI, monBII, monCI and monCII. In frame deletion of either of the individual genes monCII (encoding a putative cyclase) or monBII (encoding a putative novel isomerase) specifically abolished monensin production. Also, heterologous expression of monCI, encoding a flavin-linked epoxidase, in S. coelicolor was shown to significantly increase the ability of S. coelicolor to epoxidize linalool, a model substrate for the presumed linear polyketide intermediate in monensin biosynthesis.	1
Loss-of-function Aspergillus nidulans CclA, a Bre2 ortholog involved in histone H3 lysine 4 methylation, activated the expression of cryptic secondary metabolite clusters in A. nidulans. One new cluster generated monodictyphenone, emodin and emodin derivatives, whereas a second encoded two anti-osteoporosis polyketides, F9775A and F9775B. Modification of the chromatin landscape in fungal secondary metabolite clusters allows for a simple technological means to express silent fungal secondary metabolite gene clusters.	1
Mycinamicin, composed of a branched lactone and two sugars, desosamine and mycinose, at the C-5 and C-21 positions, is a 16-membered macrolide antibiotic produced by Micromonospora griseorubida A11725, which shows strong antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive bacteria. The nucleotide sequence (62 kb) of the mycinamicin biosynthetic gene cluster, in which there were 22 open reading frames (ORFs), was completely determined. All of the products from the 22 ORFs are responsible for the biosynthesis of mycinamicin II and self-protection against the compounds synthesized. Central to the cluster is a polyketide synthase locus (mycA), which encodes a seven-module system comprised of five multifunctional proteins. Immediately downstream of mycA, there is a set of genes for desosamine biosynthesis (mydA-G and mycB). Moreover, mydH, whose product is responsible for the biosynthesis of mycinose, lies between mydA and B. On the other hand, eight ORFs were detected upstream of the mycinamicin PKS gene. The myrB, mycG, and mycF genes had already been characterized by Inouye et al. The other five ORFs (mycCI, mycCII, mydI, mycE, and mycD) lie between mycA1 and mycF, and these five genes and mycF are responsible for the biosynthesis of mycinose. In the PKS gene, four regions of KS and AT domains in modules 1, 4, 5, and 6 indicated that it does not show the high GC content typical for Streptomyces genes, nor the unusual frame plot patterns for Streptomyces genes. Methylmalonyl-CoA was used as substrate in the functional units of those four modules. The relationship between the substrate and the unusual frame plot pattern of the KS and AT domains was observed in the other PKS genes, and it is suggested that the KS-AT original region was horizontally transferred into the PKS genes on the chromosomal DNA of several actinomycetes strains.	1
